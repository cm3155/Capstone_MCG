Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the full year of 2022
versus the full year of 2021, unless otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $37.7 billion for 2022, down
22%, earnings per share of $12.09, ROE of 14% and ROTCE of 18%.
• Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6%, reflecting:

– Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%, driven by higher
rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets net
interest income. Net interest income excluding Markets was $62.4
billion, up 40%.

– Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower
Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of net investment securities
losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in
Home Lending and lower auto operating lease income, largely
offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on
the sale of Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) in
Corporate.

• Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher
structural expense and continued investments in the business,
including compensation, technology and marketing, partially offset
by lower volume- and revenue-related expense.

• The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting:

– a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses,

consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in
consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the
allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with
borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually
recede, and

– $2.9 billion of net charge-offs.

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion, reflecting a
net reduction to the allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at

December 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to
retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%, compared with 1.62% in the
prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at

December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion, predominantly
driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved
credit performance and loan sales.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by

higher loans across the LOBs.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting:

– growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net inflows in
AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government
actions, partially offset by the impact of growth in customer
spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM, and

– reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the rising

interest rate environment.

Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and

Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively.

• SLR was 5.6%.

• TBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and
expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management, speak only as of the
date of this Form 10-K, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 154, and
the Risk Factors section on pages 9-32 of this Form 10-K for a further
discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other
factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ
materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no
assurance that actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook
information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to
update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should be
viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies,
financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the
competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and
regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will
affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make
appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response
to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

Full-year 2023
• Management expects net interest income to be approximately $73

billion, market dependent.

• Management expects net interest income excluding Markets to be

approximately $74 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $81

billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be

approximately 2.6%.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-
GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of
the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Business Developments
War in Ukraine
The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain
uncertain. The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close
positions and reduce certain of its business activities and exposures
connected with the war, and to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-
existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks.

The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and
counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of
operations. However, the Firm continues to monitor potential
secondary impacts of the war, including increased market volatility,
inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic
sanctions imposed by various governments, that could have adverse
effects on the Firm’s businesses.

The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks
associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and
economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for
Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages
131-138, Country Risk Management on pages 139-140 and
Operational Risk Management on pages 142-144 for additional
information.

For purposes of this Form 10-K, “Russia” refers to exposure to clients
and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their
assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived,
in Russia, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management
framework; and “Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial
sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which
have close association with Russia.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
The Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final
stages of the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs in accordance with the International
Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-
based benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the
remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-
month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (“LIBOR
Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the
notional amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar
LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans,
securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to
meet both its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as the
industry milestones and recommendations published by National
Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee
in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage with clients to assist
them with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to
replacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of
the Firm’s remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The
Firm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central
counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked
to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will
remediate approximately 40% of the Firm’s remaining U.S. dollar
LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the
remaining derivatives exposure will be remediated predominantly
through contractual fallback provisions.

On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR
Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a
framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in
legacy financial contracts that may not otherwise transition to a
replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In addition, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that the administrator of
LIBOR be required to continue to publish the one-month, three-month
and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a “synthetic” basis which
would allow market participants to use such rates through September
30, 2024. This proposal would apply to contracts that are outside the
scope of the LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts
that are not governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the
proposed publication of “synthetic” LIBOR are intended to facilitate,
and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from LIBOR,
including the potential for disputes or litigation.

The Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk
management systems in connection with the transition from LIBOR,
including modifications to its operational systems and models. In
addition, the Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry,
market, regulatory and legislative developments relating to the
transition from LIBOR. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages
9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting
Developments on page 153 for additional information.

(a) Included operating lease income of $3.7 billion, $4.9 billion and $5.5 billion for the

years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also includes losses
on tax-oriented investments. Refer to Note 6 for additional information.

2022 compared with 2021
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, as volatile market
conditions resulted in:

• lower equity and debt underwriting fees due to lower issuance

activity, and

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced deals.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:

• higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a strong

performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market
conditions, particularly Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates,
partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products and Credit,
and

• higher revenue associated with Equity Derivatives and Prime

Finance in Equity Markets,

largely offset by

• a loss of $836 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB,

compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior year. The loss in
the current year reflected funding spread widening and, to a lesser
extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia
and Russia-associated counterparties,

• net markdowns recorded in the second quarter of 2022 on held-for-

sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge
financing portfolio in CIB and CB,

• higher net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in

Corporate, and

• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment

transactions, which were more than offset by the related net interest
income earned on those transactions.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have
offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The
Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total
revenue basis.

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 67-72,
pages 73-75 and pages 79-80, respectively, and Note 6 for additional
information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to higher service
fee volume in CCB, predominantly offset by lower cash management
fees in CB and CIB due to a higher level of credits earned by clients
and applied against such fees. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment
results on pages 63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively,
and Note 6 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue
decreased driven by:

• lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from lower average
market levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most money
market fund fee waivers, and net long-term inflows,

• lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily associated with

lower average market values of assets under custody, and

• lower brokerage commissions, largely in AWM, reflecting reduced

volumes,

partially offset by

• higher commissions on travel-related services and annuity sales in

CCB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 63-66, pages
67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and Note 6 for additional
information.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and loan
growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 trillion, up $133
billion, and the yield was 2.78%, up 97 basis points (“bps”). The net
yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.00%, an increase of 36
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 2.60%, up 69 bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates
schedule on pages 292-296 for further information. Net yield
excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures on pages 58-60 for a further discussion of Net
yield excluding Markets.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected higher net losses on
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries,
associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-
80 and Note 10 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by Home
Lending, reflecting:

• lower production revenue due to lower margins and volume,

largely offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting

– the absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in the prior

year primarily driven by updates to model inputs related to
prepayment expectations, and

– higher operating revenue due to a higher level of third-party loans

serviced.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and 15 for
further information.

Card income decreased driven by higher amortization related to new
account origination costs, partially offset by higher annual fees in
CCB, and higher payments revenue on volume growth in commercial
cards in CIB and CB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, pages
67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for further
information.
Other income decreased reflecting:
• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a decline in

volume, and

• net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM, compared with

net gains in the prior year,

partially offset by

• an increase in Other Corporate from:

– a gain of $914M on the sale of Visa B shares,

– higher net gains related to certain other investments, and

– proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of

2022,

• a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial

satisfaction of a loan in CB,

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates related to net

investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, primarily as a result of the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and

• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in the prior

year on certain renewable energy investments in CIB.

Refer to Note 2 for additional information on Visa B shares.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

 
Net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021, and
included:

• a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing
financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit
balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the
growth in consumer spending,

offset by

• a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and Banking &
Wealth Management (“BWM”) as net charge-offs in the prior year
benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance
programs, and an increase of $76 million in CIB.

Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66, CIB on
pages 67-72, CB on pages 73-75, AWM on pages 76-78, the
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, and Notes 1, 10 and

2022 compared with 2021
The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting a net
addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses and $2.9
billion of net charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for credit
losses consisted of:

• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm’s

macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and
CIB, and

• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services,
reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the
allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with
borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

The prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the allowance
for credit losses.

Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both
updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which
now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased
weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter
of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.

the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

2022 compared with 2021
Compensation expense increased driven by additional headcount,
primarily in technology and operations, as well as front office, and the
impact of inflation, partially offset by lower revenue-related
compensation in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher investments in the business, including marketing and

technology, and

• higher structural expense, including travel and entertainment;

regulatory assessments; occupancy expense associated with higher
utilities and exit costs of certain leases; and other employee-related
expense,

partially offset by

• lower volume-related expense, reflecting lower depreciation

expense on lower Auto lease assets; and lower distribution fees in
AWM, partially offset by higher operating losses and outside
services, both in CCB; and

• lower legal expense.

The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's
Foundation.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased
primarily as a result of lower deposits across the LOBs and loan
growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of its excess
cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements increased, reflecting:
• the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making

activities and on collateral requirements in Markets,

• higher demand for securities to cover short positions in Fixed Income

Markets, and

• an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.
Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets, reflecting lower
client-driven activities and lower demand for securities to cover short
positions in Equity Markets.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities purchased
under resale agreements and securities borrowed.
Trading assets increased due to:
• higher derivative receivables, primarily in foreign exchange, as a

result of market movements, and

• an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities decreased, driven by lower available-for-sale
(“AFS”) securities, partially offset by higher held-to-maturity (“HTM”)
securities, which includes the impact of the transfer of $78.3 billion of
securities from AFS to HTM in 2022, for capital management
purposes.

• The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, as well
as unrealized losses, which are recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”),

largely offset by net purchases, and

• the increase in HTM securities also reflected purchases partially

offset by paydowns.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80, Investment
Portfolio Risk Management on page 130 and Notes 2 and 10 for
additional information on investment securities.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• higher balances in Card Services driven by higher consumer

spending and net new originations,

• higher originations and revolver utilization in CB, and
• higher wholesale loans in CIB,
partially offset by
• lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales

outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and

• the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net addition of
$3.3 billion to the allowance for loan losses, consisting of:
• $2.1 billion in wholesale, resulting from deterioration in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and
CIB, and

• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services,

reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the
allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with
borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

There was also a $121 million addition to the allowance for lending-
related commitments recognized in other liabilities

on the Consolidated balance sheets, and a $54 million addition to the
allowance for investment securities.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130,
and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion of loans and the
allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to higher
client receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets, as well
as higher receivables in Payments related to the timing of payment
activities, with December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend.

Premises and equipment, refer to Note 16 and 18 for additional

Deposits decreased reflecting:
• attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB,
partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,

• net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate

environment, and

• a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher
customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new
accounts.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements increased due to:
• higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and

CIO.

Short-term borrowings decreased predominantly as a result of lower
financing requirements in Markets.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for additional
information on deposits, federal funds purchased and securities loaned
or sold under repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; and
also to Notes 2 and 17 for deposits and Note 11 for federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-making
activities, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in Markets.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased reflecting:

• higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates and net

additions, partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows,
and

• additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Renovite

Technologies, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2022, Global Shares PLC
and Figg, Inc. in the third quarter of 2022, and Frosch Travel Group,
LLC and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information.

Other assets increased predominantly due to the impact of securities
financing activities in Markets, offset by lower auto operating lease
assets in CCB.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due to higher client
payables related to client-driven activities in Markets, including Prime
Finance, as well as higher payables in Payments related to the timing
of payment activities, with December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend.
Refer to Note 19 for additional information.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased driven
by higher issuance of commercial paper as a result of an increase in
loan balances in the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and Notes 14 and 28 for
additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization
trusts.

Long-term debt decreased driven by:

• fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and CIO as a
result of higher rates, and a decline in the fair value of structured
notes in Markets,

largely offset by
• net issuances of senior debt in Treasury and CIO and structured

notes in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-
104 and Note 20 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity reflects net unrealized losses in AOCI,
predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates on the AFS
portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO. Refer to

Operating activities
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support
the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. These assets and
liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to
the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-
driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The
Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through
secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating
liquidity needs.

• In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and
other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from
sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially
offset by higher trading assets.

• In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and
higher accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by
higher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities.

proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.

• In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds
from long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease
in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.

• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock

and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.

Management’s discussion and analysis

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on
pages 159-163. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported”
basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results
that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a
comparison of the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial
statements of other companies.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis,
management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio,
on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are
non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of
the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed
basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and
includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE
basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits
and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a
basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These
financial measures allow

management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-
year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is
recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no
impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the
LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the
Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP
financial measures provide information to investors about the
underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the
particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the
performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment
Results on pages 61-80 for additional information on these non-GAAP
measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not
be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures
used by other companies.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding
CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue on a managed basis, management also reviews these
metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown below. CIB Markets
consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics,
which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures.
Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and
deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with CIB
Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses CIB
Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets
may occur across revenue lines. Management believes that these
measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to
analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity

In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures such as
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding

Firmwide legal expense, and

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total

noninterest expense.

Management believes that these measures help investors understand
the effect of these items on reported results and provide an alternative
presentation of the Firm’s performance.

The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to period-end
loans retained excluding trade finance and conduits, a non-GAAP
financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s
allowance coverage ratio.

Management’s discussion and analysis

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate &
Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner
in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 58-60 for a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present each
segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management
reporting process that derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an
annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment
reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future
periods. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics
which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in
assessing performance.

Revenue sharing
When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating business segments
may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is
generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in
the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing
agreements.

Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by corporate
support units, or another business segment, the costs of those
services are allocated to the respective business segments. The
expense is generally

allocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In
contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support
units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any
LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in
Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs
that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone
businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular business
segment.

Funds transfer pricing
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm
allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other
Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk
to Treasury and CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance
sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions
and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest
income to the segments.

As a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for
assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased,
impacting the business segments’ net interest income. During the
period ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of
funds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other
Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses.
Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the
impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for
additional information.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of
the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt
and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business
segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and
preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the
relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the
LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt
is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net
income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a

business segment’s net income applicable to common equity.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for additional
information.

Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred
to as equity. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III
Standardized Risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), Basel III Advanced
RWA, the global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge,
and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least
annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated
to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of
updates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes in RWA for
each LOB.

Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional information
on capital allocation.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $14.9 billion, down 29%, reflecting a net increase in
the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior
year.

Net revenue was $55.0 billion, an increase of 10%.

Net interest income was $39.9 billion, up 22%, predominantly driven
by:

• margin expansion on higher rates as well as growth in deposits in
Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”), and higher revolving
loans in Card Services,

partially offset by

• lower NII associated with PPP loan forgiveness in BWM, and tighter

loan spreads in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, down 13%, reflecting:

Noninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting:

• investments in the business and higher structural expenses,

predominantly driven by compensation, technology and marketing,

partially offset by

• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, predominantly driven
by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets, partially
offset by higher operating losses.

The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, driven by:

• net charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion in the prior

year and included

– a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing
financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit
balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the
growth in consumer spending,

• lower production revenue from lower margins and volume in Home

largely offset by

Lending,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in

volume, and

• lower card income reflecting higher amortization related to new

account origination costs partially offset by higher annual fees in
Card Services, while net interchange income was relatively flat,

partially offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting the absence of a
net loss in MSR risk management in the prior year primarily driven
by updates to model inputs related to prepayment expectations, as
well as higher operating revenue on a higher level of third-party
loans serviced,

• higher commissions reflecting travel-related services in Card

Services and increased annuity sales in BWM, and

• higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee volume in

BWM.

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income and asset
management, administration and commissions.
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the
value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and
related income.

– a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and BWM as
net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from government
stimulus and payment assistance programs, and

• a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses driven

by

– $950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding

balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook,
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the
effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and

– $175 million in Home Lending.

The prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130
and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129 for a further
discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans
90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $187 million,
$342 million and $558 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded
based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by
regulatory guidance.

(b) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, generally excludes loans that were under

payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to
Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 for further information on consumer assistance.
Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral
programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which were
considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(c) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, included $350 million, $5.4 billion and $19.2
billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not
expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are
guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 for a further
discussion of the PPP.

(d) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of loans under payment

Management’s discussion and analysis

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $15.0 billion, down 29%.

Net revenue was $47.9 billion, down 7%.

Banking revenue was $15.3 billion, down 23%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, down 48%, driven by
lower Investment Banking fees, which were also down 48%, as
volatile market conditions resulted in lower fees across products,
and $251 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in the
second quarter of 2022. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment
Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%, and debt
underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, down 43%, due to lower
issuance activity.

– Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a lower

level of announced deals.

• Payments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and included the net
impact of equity investments. Excluding this net impact, revenue
was $7.8 billion, up 33%, driven by deposit margin expansion on
higher rates and growth in fees on higher volumes.

• Lending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by higher net

interest income primarily on higher loans, as well as fair value gains
on hedges of retained loans, compared with losses in the prior year.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6 billion, up 2%.
Markets revenue was $29.0 billion, up 6%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up 10%, driven by
strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market
conditions, particularly in Currencies & Emerging Markets and
Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%, driven by

lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by Equity Derivatives.

• Securities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%, driven by
deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees,
largely offset by lower average market values of assets under
custody and lower deposits.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836 million, reflecting

funding spread widening, and, to a lesser extent, losses on
exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-
associated counterparties, compared with a gain of $250 million in
the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher
structural expense and investments in the business, including higher
compensation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation
as well as lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven
by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of
$1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses.

difference between the price at which a market participant is willing
and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which
another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm,
and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are
interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-
related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and
commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions. 

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement data for
the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets
and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal
transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance
on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line
items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may
be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a
description of the composition of these income statement line items.

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and
commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making
activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized
upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as
“inventory-related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has
been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and
changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively
manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal
transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions
with market participants is affected by many factors including the level
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the

(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days
determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk
Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For
more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 133-135.

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $4.2 billion, down 20%, reflecting a net increase in
the provision for credit losses compared with a net benefit in the prior
year.

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net interest income was $8.2
billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates
and growth in loans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher
funding costs and lower deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by lower
investment banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing
portfolio. The decreases were partially offset by a gain on an equity
method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan.

Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, up 17%, largely driven by
higher volume-and revenue-related expense, as well as structural
expense, including higher compensation expense, and expense
associated with growth in payments.

The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, predominantly driven
by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of
$947 million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses.

(a) Includes card income of $685 million, $624 million and $525 million for the years

ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income tax credits

related to equity investments in designated community development entities and in
entities established for rehabilitation of historic properties, as well as tax-exempt
income related to municipal financing activities of $322 million, $330 million and
$350 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are
primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral includes
receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.
Products include term loans, revolving lines of credit, bridge
financing, asset-based structures, leases, and standby letters of
credit.

Payments includes revenue from a broad range of products and
services that CB clients use to manage payments and receipts
globally, as well as invest and manage funds.

Investment banking includes investment banking fees and
markets revenue from a full range of products and services
providing CB clients with advisory, loan syndications, capital-raising
in equity and debt markets, and risk management solutions.

Other revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent adjustments
generated from Community Development Banking and activity
derived from principal transactions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT

Asset & Wealth Management, with client assets of $4.0 trillion, is
a global leader in investment and wealth management.

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $4.4 billion, down 8%.

Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 5%. Net interest income was $5.2
billion, up 35%. Noninterest revenue was $12.5 billion, down 4%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $8.8 billion, down 5%,
predominantly driven by:

• net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in the prior

year and,

• lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in market levels
and the impact of net liquidity outflows, predominantly offset by the
removal of most money market fund fee waivers.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $8.9 billion, up 16%, driven
by:

• margin expansion on higher rates and higher average deposits; and

to a lesser extent higher average loans and wider spreads,

partially offset by

• lower brokerage and placement fees on reduced volume, and lower

management fees.

Noninterest expense was $11.8 billion, up 8%, driven by higher
structural expense and investments in the business, largely
compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $128 million, driven by a net
addition to the allowance for credit losses.

The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of
$227 million driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses.

Asset Management
Offers multi-asset investment management solutions across
equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market funds to
institutional and retail investors providing for a broad range of
clients’ investment needs.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall
fund performance.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-

star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted
performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents
the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom
10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten-
year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate
star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and
hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and
the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund
rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset
values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura
provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if
all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the
1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced
from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee
absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on
fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent the quartile ranking for
U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other
funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been
included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and Acc share

class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.

Client assets
2022 compared with 2021
Client assets were $4.0 trillion, a decrease of 6%. Assets under
management were $2.8 trillion, a decrease of 11% driven by lower
market levels and net outflows from liquidity products, partially offset
by continued net inflows into long term products.

December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

2022 compared with 2021

Net loss was $743 million, compared with a net loss of $3.7 billion in
the prior year.

Net revenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $3.5 billion
driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially
offset by lower noninterest revenue.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.8 billion, compared with a gain
of $68 million driven by:

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, and U.S. Treasuries associated with
repositioning the investment securities portfolio,

• the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain revenues,

primarily as result of the U.S. dollar strengthening,

• net losses related to cash deployment transactions, which were

more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those
transactions,

• net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method investment
related to the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments compared

with net gains in prior year.

partially offset by

• a gain on the sale of Visa B shares. In connection with the sale, the
Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the
shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with
changes in the rate at which the shares are convertible into Visa
Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”). Refer to Note 2 for
additional information,

• higher net gains related to certain Other Corporate investments,

and

• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022.

Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, down $768 million,
predominantly driven by:

• lower structural expense reflecting the impact of movements in

foreign exchange on certain expenses primarily as a result of the
U.S. dollar strengthening, and lower retained technology expense,
and

• a lower contribution to the Firm’s Foundation.

partially offset by

• higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's

international consumer growth initiatives.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated
with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO
on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.
Refer to Foreign Exchange Risk on page 62 for additional information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by benefits related
to tax audit settlements as well as other tax adjustments, partially
offset by a change in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impacted
the Firm's tax reserves.

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer
growth initiatives, which include Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail
bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a
40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which
closed in the first quarter of 2022.

Treasury and CIO overview
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring,
monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding,
capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks
managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by
the Firm’s four major reportable business segments to serve their
respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance
sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability
management objectives generally by investing in high-quality
securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s
investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses
derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition,
Treasury and CIO manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through
deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further
information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 131-138 for information on interest rate and
foreign exchange risks.

The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and
non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and government agency
and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan
obligations, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other
ABS. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment
securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3
billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and,
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer
to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities.
When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises
customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets
in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its
business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving
the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among
other things:

• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation

of risks by all individuals within the Firm;

• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework
with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the
Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues
is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and
incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers
of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. 

Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks
include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory
or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business
decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,
dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.

Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The
Firm’s risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:

• Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation

associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or
inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.

• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or
change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or
loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments,
including

consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio
risk.

• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in

market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity
and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the
value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.

• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from

inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors;
or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems.
Operational risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk.

Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and
qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting,
including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and
capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts
such as damage to the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and
customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide
basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (“IRM”)
function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance.
The Firm’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to
approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board
Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the
IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm.
The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee
through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and
Oversight Policy.

The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide
Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and
Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance
organizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance policies and
standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s
risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise
in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span
across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions. Each area of
the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the
parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own
management-identified risk and control standards.

Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows:

The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and
certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations,
Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense own
the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the
design and execution of controls to manage those risks.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

81

Management’s discussion and analysis

Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework
established by IRM, which may include policies, standards, limits,
thresholds and controls.

The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is separate
from, and independently assesses and challenges, the first line of
defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible for the
identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to
applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and
implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own
processes.

The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function
that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness
of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management.
The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide
control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of
defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These
other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within
their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules
and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework
established by IRM.

Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their
respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of
controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To
support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework
designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to
identify material risks inherent to the Firm’s business and operational
activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material
risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the
LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, maintains the central repository
and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk
Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee.

Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk Appetite”
frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. Periodically the
Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by senior management
(including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk
Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor
and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated
risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk
Committee.

82

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels for the escalation of
risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance and
oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown
in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s CEO,
CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General Counsel, CEOs of the
LOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer
matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is
responsible for escalating to the Board the information necessary to
facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.

Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business and
affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s financial
performance and condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and
plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant portion of its
oversight responsibilities through its principal standing committees,
each of which consists solely of independent members of the Board.
The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees
risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control environment,
and the Compensation & Management Development Committee
oversees compensation and other management-related matters. Each
committee of the Board oversees reputational risks, conduct risks,
and ESG matters within its scope of responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for
the oversight of management of the bank, which it discharges both
acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the
Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board

Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with
respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the
Compensation & Management Development Committee.

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of
management’s responsibility to implement a global risk management
framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the
Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s responsibilities include
approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain
associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that
may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and
liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are
escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an effective
system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm’s
assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm’s financial
statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical
standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and
regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the
qualifications, independence and performance of the Firm’s
independent registered public accounting firm, and of the
performance of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

83

 
Management’s discussion and analysis

The Compensation & Management Development Committee
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews and
approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified benefits programs.
The Committee reviews the performance of Operating Committee
members against their goals, and approves their compensation
awards. In addition, the CEO’s award is subject to ratification by the
independent directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the
development of and succession for key executives. As part of the
Board’s role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture, including
reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct
issues and any related actions with respect to employees, including
compensation actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews the Firm's
positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as
community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices
and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and
character and could impact the Firm's reputation among its
stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on these
matters to management and the Board, as appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises
general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board of
Directors. It reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the
Board proposed nominees for election to the Board. The Committee
evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate governance
practices applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for
assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation.

Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are primarily
responsible for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest
management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks inherent in the
Firm’s business and provides a forum for discussion of topics, and
issues that are raised or escalated by its members and other
committees.

The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation committee
for senior management to review and discuss the Firmwide
operational risk environment including identified issues, operational
risk metrics and significant events that have been escalated.

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible for
overseeing the governance, limits, and controls that have been
established within the scope of their respective activities. These
committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the
businesses operating in a particular region could be exposed to
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating
and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees.

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees
oversee the operational risk and control environment of their
respective business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk,
Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they are
responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and
other data that may impact the level of operational risk in a business
or function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an emphasis
on processes with control concerns and overseeing control
remediation.

The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management (“ALM”),
including the activities and frameworks supporting management of the
balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and capital risk.

The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is composed of
senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing
the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted
across the Firm.

Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight
functions. The scope of a particular function or business activity may
include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For
example, Country Risk Management oversees country risk which may
be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise
to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk.

The following sections discuss the risk governance and oversight
functions that have been established to manage the risks inherent in
the Firm’s business activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation
associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or
inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.

Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior leadership of each
LOB and Corporate, is responsible for managing the Firm’s most
significant strategic risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business
discussions and decision-making, including participation in relevant
business reviews and senior management meetings, risk and control
committees and other relevant governance forums, and acquisition
and new business initiative reviews. The Board of Directors oversees
management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee
oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk governance framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives,
LOB and Corporate senior management identify the associated risks
that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification framework
and their impact on risk appetite.

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and
Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile
of the Firm.

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the
development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic initiatives,
is one component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic
plan outlines the Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and
includes components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings
and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the Firm’s How

Management’s discussion and analysis

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition
of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated
risks during normal economic environments and under stressed
conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy
and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to
manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic
imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating
Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on
risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term
stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading
businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior
management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to
making significant decisions that could impact future business
activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook,
senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a
view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.

Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary
objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the
Firm.

Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and

indicators, including capital risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit

breaches;

• Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital management

activities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan
described below; and

• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital

framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable
regulatory capital rules.

Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management are to:

• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in

the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and in stressed
environments;

• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment

opportunities;

• Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its

subsidiaries;

• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital

ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status for the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times
under applicable regulatory capital requirements;

• Meet capital distribution objectives; and

• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a

resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution
strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through:

• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and

maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal
minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s regulatory capital
requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital
adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;

• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events;

and

• Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and following

prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal
entity levels.

Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital
management include the Capital Governance Committee, the
Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury
and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk
Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer
to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for additional
discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding Companies
(“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least annually a capital plan
that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The
Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to ensure that large
BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial
stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and
planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to
enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through
CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy
and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as
well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend
payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results
under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to
determine each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for
the coming year.

On June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had completed the
Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test process. On August 4,
2022, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement
of 4.0% (up from 3.2%), and the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital
ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, of 12.0% (up from
11.2%). The 2022 SCB requirement became effective on October 1,
2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on actions taken
by the Firm’s Board of Directors.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of
Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s processes for
managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with
supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy.
The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital
planning. The Firm’s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and
approving the capital planning framework.

Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic
and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic
scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are
defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These
scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which
generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic
operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and
stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In
addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also
considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as
necessary.

Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital
management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles
underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in
normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The
Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted
capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the
ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out
the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or
considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of
stress.

Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-
capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company.
The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital
Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and
overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active
U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,
including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined
by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-
balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital
ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower
of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III
Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the
Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk
RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced,
operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk
RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that
for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is
generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily
by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated
on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and
Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these
approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate
management judgment and feedback from its regulators.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer
to SLR on page 93 for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition.
Until December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected a two year delay
of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is
being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of
December 31, 2022, the Firm’s CET1 capital reflected the remaining
$2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition
provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of
the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2
capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA,
as applicable.

Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting
guidance.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1,
2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach for Counterparty
Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced the Current Exposure
Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the
Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models
are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR
in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S.
banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.

The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm’s
Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's
derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a
decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and
a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the
adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a
lesser extent than Standardized RWA.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements

The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum
CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.

Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold
additional levels of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”.
The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a
discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital
conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital
requirements and a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for
Standardized regulatory capital requirements.

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to
assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately
prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end,
and is subject to the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB
surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment
methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board
(“FSB”) across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. “Method 2”,
calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include
a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability,
and introduces a GSIB score “multiplication factor”.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

89

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are
currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking
organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an
additional 2.0% leverage buffer.

The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the
Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated
by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less
amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding
certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments
and derivatives potential future exposure.

Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory
requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the
Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share
repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus
payments.

Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the
Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and
leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations
issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action
(“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”),
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as
the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is
subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the
Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s Basel III
measures.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge for
the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For 2023, the
Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has
increased to 2.5% and 4.0%, respectively.

2023

2.5 %
4.0 %

2022

2.0 %

2021

3.5 %

On November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based
upon data as of December 31, 2021, which affirmed the Firm’s
Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January
1, 2023.

The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December
31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2024. The Firm’s
estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December
31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in
effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to
4.5% on January 1, 2024.

The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for
setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into
account the macro financial environment in which large,
internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2022, the
U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal
Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer
can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be
calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month
implementation period.

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-
based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer
(inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will
result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may
distribute, such as through dividends and common share
repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus
payments.

Risk-based Capital Targets
The Firm’s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital
ratio is 13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the
first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB
surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital
Buffer. The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets
dependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the
Basel III capital rules currently in effect.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier
holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of
external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to
TLAC on page 95 for additional information.

Line of business equity
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly
rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is
measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as
key measures of a business segment’s performance.

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge,
and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least
annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated
to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has
changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of
updates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes in RWA for
each LOB.

segment.

Capital actions

Common stock dividends
The Firm’s common stock dividends are planned as part of the Capital
Management governance framework in line with the Firm’s capital
management objectives.

The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend is currently $1.00 per
share. The Firm’s dividends are subject to approval by the Board of
Directors on a quarterly basis.
Refer to Note 21 and Note 26 for information regarding dividend
restrictions.

Common stock
Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase up to
$30 billion of common shares under its common share repurchase
program, which superseded the previously approved repurchase
program under which the Firm was authorized to purchase up to
$30 billion of common shares.

On July 14, 2022, the Firm announced that it had temporarily
suspended share repurchases in anticipation of the increase in the
Firm's regulatory capital requirements. The Firm had set a target for
achieving CET1 capital of 13.0% by the first quarter of 2023. The Firm
met and exceeded that target in the fourth quarter of 2022, and
resumed repurchasing shares under its common share repurchase
program in the first quarter of 2023.

The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common stock
for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares
is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases
and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is
subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and
regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account
goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative
investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share repurchase
program approved by the Board does not establish specific price
targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by
management at any time; and may be executed through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-
1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into
from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares
during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common
shares — for example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities on page 34 of the 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s equity securities.

regulatory capital ratio requirements.

Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the regulatory
minimum plus applicable buffers will result in limitations on the
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through
dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on certain
executive discretionary bonus payments.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its
contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it
does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of
funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk management
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) function whose
primary objective is to provide independent oversight of liquidity risk
across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities include:

• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;

•

Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators,
including liquidity risk appetite;

• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit

breaches;

• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management

processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness based on
LRM’s Independent Review Framework;

• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity

stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity
positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and

• Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress

assumptions.

Liquidity management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.

The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management are to:

• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities

are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual
and contingent financial obligations through normal economic
cycles as well as during stress events, and

• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.
The Firm addresses these objectives through:

• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the
assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking
into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;

• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;

• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-specific liquidity

strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;

• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk appetite

tolerances and limits;

• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to

funding and liquidity risk; and

• Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics

of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance
sheet items.

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm
manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach
designed to:

• Optimize liquidity sources and uses;

• Monitor exposures;

•

Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm’s
legal entities; and

• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide

and legal entity level, where relevant.

Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide
ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee,
and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee
reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal
approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84
for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has
sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including
scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery
planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal entities on a regular
basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific
market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the
Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and take into
consideration:

• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding

markets;

• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;

• Considerations of credit rating downgrades;

• Collateral haircuts; and

• Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of

liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as
regulatory, legal or other restrictions.

Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and
currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic
stresses.

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s
funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent
Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and
long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company,
JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), provides funding support
to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.
The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and
operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk
tolerances and

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

97

Management’s discussion and analysis

minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of
stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.

Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the strategies
for addressing and managing liquidity resource needs during a
liquidity stress event and incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators
and risk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the alternative
contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its
legal entities in a period of stress.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their
respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30
calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes
of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that
satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule.
HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid
securities as defined in the LCR rule.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum
LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates,
must be excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow
and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the
balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The
LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to
be a minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022,
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 based on the Firm’s
interpretation of the LCR framework.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the
three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three
months ended September 30, 2022 reflecting a decrease in
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in
cash associated with a decline in deposits, and loan growth.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months
ended December 31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same
period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth
and a decline in deposits as well as lower market values of HQLA-
eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.

The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates
from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and
estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity.
Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA
discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities,
such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to
non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was
approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be
raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31,
2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities
at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the
discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $323
billion and $308 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and
securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing
capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to
increased credit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve
Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing
capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for
large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy
of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on
the Firm’s current interpretation of the final rule. The Firm will be
required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semiannually
beginning in the second half of 2023.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding
capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations,
which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of
funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in
the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or
long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured

long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured
borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess
funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk
characteristics.

Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance sheet
obligations.

Deposits

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s
reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the
Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating
deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of
liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain
operating service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more
representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances.
However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be
affected.

Average deposits were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022
compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting:

• growth in CCB from existing and new accounts across both

consumer and small business customers, partially offset by a
decline in deposits starting in the second half of 2022, impacted by
growth in customer spending, and

Period-end deposits decreased reflecting:

• attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB,
partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,

• net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate

environment, and

• a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher
customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new
accounts.

The increase in deposits for both spot and averages in Corporate was
driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.

Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 55-56 and
pages 61-80, respectively, for further information on deposit and
liability balance trends.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides
additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit
insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in
which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection
for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At December 31,
2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were
$1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting
wholesale operating deposits.

Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table below
presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits,
and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured
U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates
periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this

Short-term funding
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of
securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These
instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to
repurchase increased at December 31, 2022, compared with
December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets
in Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS
investment securities in Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and
financing activities of clients, the Firm’s demand for financing, the
ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities
and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist
of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed
funds.

The decrease in period-end commercial paper and the increase in
average balances for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared
to the respective prior year periods, was due to changes in net
issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management.

102

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

 
Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by
expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining
diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in
creating its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding
needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The
IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings.
Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the
Firm’s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the
number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The
nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends
on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress
testing metrics. The Firm believes that it

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in
funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-
party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit
ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in
Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings
downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives
and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:

J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. and J.P. Morgan AG.

On September 29, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the Parent Company’s
long-term issuer rating to A1 (previously A2) and changed the long-
term outlook to stable (previously positive). All other ratings and
outlooks of the Parent Company and those of the Firm's principal
bank and non-bank subsidiaries were affirmed by Moody's.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes
in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future
borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock
price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and
diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong
credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding
sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and
geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader
ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.

104

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for
managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of
employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of
the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a
transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a
business process or consider any other activity. Environmental
impacts and social concerns are increasingly important considerations
in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a component of the
Firm’s reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues that are deemed to be material are escalated
as appropriate.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively
impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the
Firm’s competence by various constituents, including clients,
counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees,
communities or the broader public.

Organization and management
Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance framework
for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate.
Reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and
quantify.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the following
activities:

• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a

standard consistent with the reputation risk framework

• Overseeing the governance execution through processes and
infrastructure that support consistent identification, escalation,
management and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide

The types of events that result in reputation risk are wide-ranging and
may be introduced by the Firm’s employees and the clients,
customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business.
These events could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory
enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as
other harm to the Firm.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or
change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of
principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including
consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio
risk.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit
profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit
to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses.
In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk
primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed
to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and
hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as
through its operating services activities (such as cash management
and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio
and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk
throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures.
The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following
activities:

• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework

• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio

segments, including transaction and exposure approval

• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines

• Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the

approval of credit exposure

• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and

• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-

based capital management

Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for
estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default.
Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several
factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale),
risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and
borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk
management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement
is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the
loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described
in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its
exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit
losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment
loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related
commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects
estimated credit losses related to the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates
used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the
allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of
actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses
and lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses
include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios
as described below.

Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in
the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the
potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on
estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the
underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The
stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in
delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In
addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also
considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including
industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The
Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite
both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of
stress on individual counterparties.

106

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review
function is responsible for:

• Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to

exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit     portfolio, and assessing
the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible
business units; and

• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of
the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses
and risk grading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper
monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance
with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale
loans.

Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making,
aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration
levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior
members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of
industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and
geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a
quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure,
credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and
discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board
of Directors.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to
preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-
making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed
accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed
actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy
framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration
limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition,
certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and
monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are
separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends,
including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these
trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies
and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates
delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current
and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks.
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are
incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses
and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio,
industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established
concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as
deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty
limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite,
are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the
risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the
impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity
to meet its obligations is decreasing.

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is
accomplished through a number of means, including:

• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes

• Loan syndications and participations

• Loan sales and securitizations

• Credit derivatives

• Master netting agreements, and

• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

Customer and client assistance
The Firm provided various forms of assistance to customers and
clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment
deferrals and covenant modifications. Assistance provided in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of
delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those
customers and clients who would have otherwise moved into past due
or nonaccrual status. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for further information
on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan modifications and the
allowance for credit losses.

Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”)
The PPP, implemented by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”),
provided the Firm with delegated authority to process and originate
PPP loans. When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to
forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness
amount from the SBA. The PPP ended for new applications on May
31, 2021.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm had $490 million and $6.7
billion, respectively, of PPP loans, including $350 million and $5.4
billion, respectively, in consumer, and $140 million and $1.3 billion,
respectively, in wholesale.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $119 million and $633 million,
respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due have been
excluded from the Firm’s nonaccrual loans as they are guaranteed by
the SBA. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential
real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and business banking
loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s
focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer
credit market. Originated mortgage loans are retained in the
residential real estate portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government
agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of
consumer loans are typically retained on the balance sheet. Refer to
Note 12 for further information on the consumer loan portfolio. Refer
to Note 28 for further information on lending-related commitments.

Maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates
The table below sets forth loan maturities by scheduled repayments, by class of loan and the distribution between fixed and floating interest rates
based on the stated terms of the loan agreements. Effective December 31, 2022, the Firm revised its methodology from contractual maturities to
scheduled repayments. The Firm estimated the principal repayment amounts for both the residential real estate and auto and other loan classes by
calculating the weighted-average loan balance and interest rates for loan pools based on remaining loan term.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real
estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by
higher retained residential real estate loans.

The following discussions provide information concerning individual
loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this
portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications
and other credit quality indicators.

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of
prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 reflecting
originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased
from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and
loan sales. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended
December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year driven by lower
prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower
gross charge-offs.

Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as
warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced originations due to
higher interest rates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase
activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31,
2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$15.7 billion at December 31, 2022. This amount included $5.1 billion
of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing
payments or have been modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only
balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing
or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when
borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk
profile.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of interest-only
residential mortgage loans were $36.3 billion and $30.0 billion,
respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period
generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing
payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM.
The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net
recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit
performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of
the broader prime mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and
loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans
and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan
losses.

York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, compared with $145.5 billion, or 65%

Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to modified retained
residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted
to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs
and modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following
table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are
not TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for further information on modifications for

Management’s discussion and analysis

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at
fair value consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking
loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared
with December 31, 2021 due to paydowns of scored Auto loans and
PPP loan forgiveness in Business Banking predominantly offset by
originations of scored Auto loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended
December 31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year due to
higher scored Auto and overdraft charge-offs, as the prior year
benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance
programs. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.24% and
0.04% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

 
 
Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 driven by
growth in balances on higher consumer spending and net new
originations. The December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency
rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, respectively, increased compared to the
December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and
0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net charge-offs
decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the
prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit
from the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However,
median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022,
impacted by the growth in consumer spending.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans typically remain
on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for
loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued
and billed interest and fee income.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the total retained
credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New
York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at
December 31, 2021.

Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of credit card loans
outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, compared to $1.0
billion at December 31, 2021. These TDRs do not include loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
TDRs.

Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including
information about delinquencies, geographic and FICO composition,
and modifications.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk
primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and
hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as
through various operating services (such as cash management and
clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The
Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates
into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage
portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of
client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral
where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further
information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB,
CB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto
dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is
applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.

In 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs
remaining low.

As of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion
driven by CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially
offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased
$14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a
decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio,
largely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and CB.

As of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the
portfolio remained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure
decreased by $6.9 billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of
December 31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0
million driven by a decline in lending-related commitments in CIB and
loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and
cancelled commitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades
in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated
clients in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on
page 50 and Country Risk on pages 139-140 for additional
information. Refer to Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
on pages 118-121 for additional information.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has
been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed
with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a

receivable position at December 31, 2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential
credit concerns.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special
mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at
December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure,
respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer & Retail,
Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at
December 31, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The industry of risk category is generally based
on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on industry concentrations.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a variety of
clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-
net-worth individuals. Refer to Note 12 for a further discussion on
loans, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications
and other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan
portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Since
December 31, 2021, nonaccrual loan exposure decreased by
$50 million driven by Individuals and Individual Entities and
Transportation due to client-specific upgrades and net portfolio
activity, largely offset by Consumer & Retail due to client-specific
downgrades.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to
address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of
these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk
should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients
subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts.
Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon
or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further
information on wholesale lending-related commitments.

Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans
to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by
assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on
deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities).
Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the
Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required
margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit
additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when
appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk,
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates,
foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm
makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses
derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk
positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market
risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of
the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”),
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-
cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of
the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative
transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign
exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short

maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s
use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated
balance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31,
2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by
higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative
receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the
related cash collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral
that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s
exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of
liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid
assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk
should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets
under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral
amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the
derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7
government securities, other liquid government agency and
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities)
delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and
collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as
of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as
security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair
value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor.
Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of
collateral agreements.

internal ratings profile for the periods presented.

management process for derivatives exposures takes into
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly
defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively
correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty,
which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the
counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many
factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations
over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm
may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG.
The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into
credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange,
equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current
derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak,
DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that
exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to
the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2022
(in billions)

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of
the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future
variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future
variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client
basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss:
Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure
(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral
benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative
exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty
calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5%
confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary
measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative
contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure
management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative
exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be
equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme
measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other
credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time
periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as
the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit
risk capital and CVA, as further described below.

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to
reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s
AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the
derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its
capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage
the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to
mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities
(loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty
exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit
portfolio management activities”). Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other
exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in
the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are
not included in credit portfolio management activities.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities
do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these
derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses
recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans
and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted
for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment,
between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes
earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the
true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against
the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors,
including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience
losses on specific exposures that are different than the named
reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the
CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with
an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s
CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s
exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit
protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the
maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased,
and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and
managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further
information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit
portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of
the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for
credit losses comprises:

• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the
Consolidated balance sheets,

• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets, and

• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is
reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

Discussion of changes in the allowance

The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2
billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31,
2021, consisting of:

• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm’s

macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and
CIB, and

• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services,
reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the
allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with
borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.

Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included both
updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which
now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased
weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter
of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted
average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The
adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors
than the central case assumptions provided in the table below,
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at
5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP
exiting the second quarter of 2024.

Management’s discussion and analysis

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal
or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the
investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The
investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and
CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability
management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and
Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over
extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for
short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a
default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated
given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and
CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At
December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and
the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to
Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further
information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk
Management on pages 131-138 for further information on the market
risk inherent in the portfolio.

Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk Appetite
framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular
updates provided to the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for
reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment
securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for
investment securities are established for each risk category, including
capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In
general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and
investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's
balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm’s
principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm’s
investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including
the Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities and
minority-owned businesses.

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the
Firm’s risk governance structure. The Firm has established a
Firmwide risk policy framework for all principal investing activities that
includes approval by executives who are independent from the
investing businesses, as appropriate.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for
reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in
accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance
structure, approved levels for investments are established and
monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage
the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing
on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses
based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.

130

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and
updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for
reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing
basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time
periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior
management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering
to established limits against which exposures are monitored and
reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit
approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior
management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management
consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to
determine the suitable course of action required to return the
applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in
risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in
limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or
market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches
are escalated as appropriate.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are
limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This
imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
148.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s existing
market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and
to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market
factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and
commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.

Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm
and defines market risk policies and procedures.

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient
risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and
provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for senior
management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk
Management is responsible for the following functions:

• Maintaining a market risk policy framework

• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB,

Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

• Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments

Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk
There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore
Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and
nonstatistical, to assess risk including:

• Value-at-risk (VaR)

• Stress testing

• Profit and loss drawdowns

• Earnings-at-risk

• Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits
set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In
setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration
factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of
client business, and management judgment. Market Risk
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits
include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits
include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain
nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits
may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the
legal entity level.

testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk
positions.

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the
independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its
monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market
prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical
time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in
Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR
model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for
valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG
monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and
enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to
Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 for information
regarding model reviews and approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance
with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the
Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III
capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently
assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss
methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory
VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital
rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s
Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of
accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while
Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition,
in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR
currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for
additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components
of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based
measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting).

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical risk
measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in
the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR
framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market
values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in
the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management
VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk
management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along
with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day
holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which
approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR
provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of
diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks
and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to
senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR
models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk
factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part
of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model
calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give
rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate
numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market
values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk
profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used
to generate daily market values may be different across product types
or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all
portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of
market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based
on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons,
and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability
to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those
associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions.

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR
due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical
data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other
products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using
an actual price-based time series for these products, if available,
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers
other nonstatistical measures such as stress

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio
VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now
reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR.
(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.
(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components, and consequently, diversification benefit is not meaningful.
Average Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by
the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market observed in March 2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR,
predominantly offset by a decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by changes
in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are
utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude
certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and
intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total
net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent
with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk
Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the
Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions
observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from
the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and observed 17 VaR backtesting
exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as
disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain
components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages
70-71.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended
December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of
days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals
that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section
of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other risk measures
Stress testing
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk.
While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets
using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk
of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s
vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible
economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand
the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are
measured against limits.

The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in
the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple
magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-
offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit
spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity
prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in
specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may
impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also
incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between
different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against
possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported
periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.

Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under
the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to
calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and
Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress
testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant
changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as
appropriate.

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm’s
CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to
the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are
incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are
reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.

Profit and loss drawdowns
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above
certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline
in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income
is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s
significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the

Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment
securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by
LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest
rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the
Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with
the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and
reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk
Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO.
This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight
and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring
limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural
interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio
and interest rate derivatives.

Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors,
including:

• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets,

liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance

sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time

• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term

market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of
the yield curve)

• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or

off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and
liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer
their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer
pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate
exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These
elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate
indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for
adjustable rate products.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest
rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a
sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and
certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-
sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily
include retained loans,

136

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt
and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of
other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based
measures as described on page 132.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline over the following 12 months utilizing
multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift
involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal
amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates
constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-
term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors,
including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in

interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and
reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions
that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in
response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios
compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since
origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based
on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain
assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are
highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the
actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time,
could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part
of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact
the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans
across the industry and competition for deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas,

represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change
upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates
paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to
repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and
enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s
balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the
Firm’s simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating
the modeling of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk
scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current environment,
would significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate scenarios, with
higher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a positive impact,
and lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a negative
impact, on the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of
the

Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not
represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to
Outlook on page 49 for additional information).

Management’s discussion and analysis

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm
has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio
and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of
the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 62 for additional
information.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net
revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant
business activities that give rise to market risk on page 132 for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive instruments that are not
included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The
sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2022
and 2021, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future
changes in these sensitivities.

individual country. The use of different measurement approaches or
assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework:

• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed

with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial
institutions

• Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount
(funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and
eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received

• Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable

balance, net of eligible collateral received

• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all

positions, including both long and short positions

• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at
the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible
collateral received

• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional

amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying
reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative
receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm
manages these exposures

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting
provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to
country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other
significant developments which adversely affect the value of the
Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries.
The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various
portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and
measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk management
function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country
risk across the Firm.

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the following
activities:

• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a

comprehensive country risk framework

• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and

establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across

the Firm

• Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and

limit breaches to senior management

• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and

ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk
concerns

• Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits,
investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or
locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both
government and private-sector entities in a country.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach,
attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country
where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,
obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its
revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal
residence) or country of incorporation.

Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm’s risk
to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties,
issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities
which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not
included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing
clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities
financing receivables).

Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the
measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the
case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of
the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for
attribution to an

Management’s discussion and analysis

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk
management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses
arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset
price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management
periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test
vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response
to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns,
sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results
are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as
necessary.

Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly,
and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor
high usages and breaches against limits.

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report
exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including
Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories,
separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are
associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country
(excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries
represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual country,
based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and
does not represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from
period to period due to client activity and market flows.

The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure
to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the
central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity
management activities.

The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in
cash placed with the central bank of Australia and government debt
securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower
client cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates.

As of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately
$500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf
of clients, largely at the Russian National Settlement Depository. In
accordance with requirements of the Bank of Russia, these deposits
were transferred to the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia on
February 3, 2023.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the
Firm’s risk governance structure. The LOBs and Corporate are
responsible for integrating climate risk management into existing
governance frameworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as
appropriate.

The LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are responsible
for providing the Board Risk Committee with information on significant
climate risks and climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT

Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of climate change
on the Firm’s clients, customers, operations and business strategy.
Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing
types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into
physical risk and transition risk.

Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated
with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the
increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such
as floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers
include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels,
persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average
ambient temperatures.

Transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications
associated with a societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy.
Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy,
adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences.
Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical
climate.

Organization and management
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible
for establishing the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing
climate risk. The Climate Risk Management function engages across
the Firm to help integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk
management frameworks, as appropriate.

Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:

• Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support
identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate

Management’s discussion and analysis

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or
external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems.
Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations
and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and
can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business
disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond
the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior,
failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure
of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with
their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage
operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial
position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and
regulatory environments in which it operates.

Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”)
Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern,
identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm’s
operational risk.

Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of
operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which
consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is
responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for
Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for
defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the
minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned
CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for
Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent
of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and
Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk
Committee periodically.

Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment
process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this
process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their
respective control environment to assess where controls have failed,
and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance organization (“Operational
Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of and challenge to these
evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of
significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or
emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and
Corporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control
environments and reporting the results to senior management.

In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational
risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based
capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline
and stressed conditions.

The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the
Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates
the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections
based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a
99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal
operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which
those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to
reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving
rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s
operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced
Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and external
losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business
environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect
the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on
operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of
material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed
environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is
utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress
testing processes.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information
related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and
Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring
and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules
and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk
and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened
operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the
LOBs and Corporate.

142

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

 
Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and
testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated
through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.
Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and
Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks
appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance
are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control
Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has
established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational
risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide
basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the
evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established
thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational
risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation
protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk
subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and
Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148,
respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and
Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of
operational risks such as cybersecurity, business and technology
resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing are provided
below.

War in Ukraine and Sanctions
In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic
sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated
entities and individuals by various governments around the world,
including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions
are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face
increased operational risk associated with addressing these complex
compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm
has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of
non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in
property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments
as required by the applicable regulations.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm or loss
resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors.
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for
the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and
enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks,
storage devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security
efforts are designed to protect against, among other things,
cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain
access to confidential information, destroy data,

disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.

The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to
experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against
the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has
implemented precautionary measures and controls reasonably
designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat
monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by
the Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.

Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new
threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the
introduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to
make significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense
capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate
government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in
order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the
operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency
against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in
discussions and simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and
with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups,
and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and
certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity risks.

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the
Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges,
clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are
also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party
cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures,
misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks,
including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost
or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also
sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets,
particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s
own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in
regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients
regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security.
However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client
failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes,
clients are responsible for losses incurred.

To help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the
Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a
Information Security Program designed to prevent, detect, and
respond to cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically
provided with updates on the Firm’s Information Security Program,
recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing
efforts to improve security, as well as the Firm’s efforts regarding
significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a
cybersecurity incident response

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

143

Management’s discussion and analysis

plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted
cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses with law
enforcement and other government agencies, and notify clients and
customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is
designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a
cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization,
working with each of the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, is responsible
for identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and is responsible
for the controls to manage threats. The organization consists of
business aligned information security personnel that are supported
within the organization by the following products and services that
execute the Information Security Program for the Firm:

Identity & Access Management

• Cyber Operations
•
• Governance, Risk & Controls
• Global Technology Product Security

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls governance
structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information
security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to
disseminate information and monitor technology efforts. These forums
are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm. The forums are
used to escalate information security risks or other matters as
appropriate.

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to
identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.

The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training that
reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security
Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the
expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security
Awareness Program engages personnel through training on how to
identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources
and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally
on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing
initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides
specialized security training for certain employee roles such as
application developers. Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program
requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data
privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about
confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized
access to or use of information.

Business and technology resiliency risk
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as
the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather,
power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide
expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide
Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions
including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that
may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e.,
staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery
strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify,
assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks.

Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties
unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or
otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for
managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and
client education and awareness trainings.

Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates Oversight
(“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting,
documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier
relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives
of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to a
high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks,
including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-
Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring,
reporting and standards.

Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through
insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance
from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive
insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by
third parties with whom the Firm does business.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing
to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and
standards of self-regulatory organizations.

Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO
and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite.

Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of and
accountability for managing their compliance risk. The Firm’s
Operational Risk and Compliance Organization (“Operational Risk
and Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and Corporate,
provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business
operations with a focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and
regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and
services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and
regulations varying across the LOBs and Corporate, and jurisdictions,
and include risks related to financial products and services,
relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and
employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities,
market conduct, and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations
related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional
borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary
activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of
care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients and customers or to
treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations
that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.

Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and standards
designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and
report on compliance risk.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk
through the implementation of the CCOR Management Framework.
The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative
Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to the Board Risk
Committee and the Audit Committee on significant compliance risk
issues, as appropriate.

Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth the
Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct themselves with
integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern employee
conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as
well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm does
business. The Code requires employees to promptly report any
potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or
regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires
employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the
underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees,
clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or
agents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees upon joining
the Firm, and to current employees periodically on an ongoing basis.
Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code
annually.

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code
through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline by phone or the internet. The
Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where
laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all times
globally, with translation services. It is administered by an outside
service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who
raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the Audit
Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any
action or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or
customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the
Firm operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise the
Firm’s reputation.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing
its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and
sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s How We Do
Business Principles (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide
for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the
Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s
expectations for each employee and provides information and
resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations everywhere
the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page
145 for further discussion of the Code.

Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR Management
policy, which establishes the framework for governance, identification,
measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting
conduct risk in the Firm.

The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the Firm’s
conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and
to connect key programs across the Firm in order to identify
opportunities and emerging areas of focus. This forum is responsible
for setting overall program direction for strategic enhancements to the
Firm's employee conduct framework and reviewing the consolidated
Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people
management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including
recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance
management, promotion and compensation processes. Each LOB,
Treasury and CIO, and each designated corporate function completes
an assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and
issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides conduct
education as appropriate.

146

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss
primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal
obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the
Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products
and services offered by the Firm.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm on
all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal
advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale
transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest
for the Firm.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of
the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the
Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s General Counsel and other
members of Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s
Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee. 

Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises the
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.

Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services and advice
to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm’s exposure to
legal risk by:

• managing actual and potential litigation and enforcement matters,

including internal reviews and investigations related to such
matters

• advising on products and services, including contract negotiation

and documentation

• advising on offering and marketing documents and new business

initiatives

• managing dispute resolution

•

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising on
changes to them

• advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and

proposed laws, rules and regulations, and

• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the Board.

Management’s discussion and analysis

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the
potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect
or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-based
estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation
methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many
purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk,
assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing,
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business
decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance
and Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies
relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with
certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those
used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning
and analysis.

The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within
MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach which is used for
models, as described in detail below.

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm
based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and
developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing
and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for
review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users
and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the
models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek
to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in
product and market developments, as well as to capture
improvements in available modeling techniques and systems
capabilities.

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their
complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s
reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of
MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model
is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When
reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model
methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and
may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of
model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate
level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,
MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material
changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain
circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to
allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also
require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk
if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the
model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or
uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic
environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted
environments are significantly different from the historical
environments upon which the models were developed, as the Firm
experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This
increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment
and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to
model outputs than would otherwise be the case.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages
149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and
other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates are
integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most
complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to
ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The
Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as
part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and
judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets
or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In
addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the
process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner.
The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief
description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of
the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain
off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for
credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained

loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a
number of matters including development and weighting of
macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings,
valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the
Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic
forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter
forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter
forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”)
that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the
modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S.

unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S.
unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate
credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic
conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit
losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant
changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or
input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because
management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and
inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be
consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in
factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic
forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined
using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios,
which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The
central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those
variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page
127 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an
elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9%
higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP
with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1% lower at the end of the
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.9% in
the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak
difference of approximately 8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in
the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:

• The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit losses
beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the
weight placed on the adverse scenarios.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and

nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply
extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.

• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and

borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to
macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

149

Management’s discussion and analysis

Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or
correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two
scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences:

• An increase of approximately $500 million for residential real estate

loans and lending-related commitments

• An increase of approximately $2.2 billion for credit card loans

• An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and

lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is
not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit
losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other
adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled
lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of
these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current
circumstances and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available
information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately
governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2022.

Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair
value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note
products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets
and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value
and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the

as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a
presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The
level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting
benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in
Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The
type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the
amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For
instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs
and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,
judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those
required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within
levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,
management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or
other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of
certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant
empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed,
default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity,
equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign
exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further
discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including
unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment
must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation
adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations,
unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified
criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made
are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual
terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as
a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty
judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable
valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by
the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors
can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position.
Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the
methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and
may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the
determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions
different than those used by the Firm could result in a different
estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a
detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and
its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and
tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and
methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described
in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for
impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination
is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment
testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as
actual business results and projections of business performance.
Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not
impaired as of December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units,
fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there was no
indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current
projections and valuations.

The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with
management’s current business outlook assumptions in the short
term, and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term growth and return on
equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party
and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the
goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022.

Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs
which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their
account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program.
Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder
can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed
for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of
account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards
liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned
and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued
as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8
billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded
in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in
rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.

The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) and cost
per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to
estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be
redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used
to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions
are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder
redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates

established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on
revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning
strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax
asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management
has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its
deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when
new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and
regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax
positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are
measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An
uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit
that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon
settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s
unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective
income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final
tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s
income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final
outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded,
such differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for income
taxes in the period in which such a determination is made.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and
deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated
based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the
period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications
are known, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and
judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.

Management’s discussion and analysis

to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of
December 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR
and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by
approximately $315 million.

Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various
jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and
local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and
may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial
statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits,
JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how
to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous
transactions and business events, as well as make judgments
regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income
in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are
subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in
the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur
regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over
interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by
audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of
the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase
regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes
as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records
additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in
income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is
possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may
materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting
period.

Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities
measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment,
their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Deferred
taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes
in the period enacted.

The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with
certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm
performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets
are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and
assumptions regarding future taxable income, including foreign
source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies,
including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs
before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is
determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation
allowance is

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the
“Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
Firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s
Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making the
assessment, management used the “Internal Control — Integrated
Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

Based upon the assessment performed, management concluded that
as of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013
framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the
Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
