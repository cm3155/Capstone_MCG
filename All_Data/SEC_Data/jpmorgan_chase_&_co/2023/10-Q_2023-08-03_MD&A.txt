Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the second quarter of 2023 versus the second quarter of 2022, unless otherwise specified. 

Firmwide overview 

For the second quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.5 billion, up 67%, earnings per share of $4.75, ROE of 20% and ROTCE of 25%. The Firm's results for the second quarter of 2023 included an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion in Corporate and a net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $1.2 billion associated with the First Republic acquisition. The Firm's results also included investment securities losses of $900 million in Treasury and CIO. 

&#8226; Total net revenue was $41.3 billion, up 34%, reflecting: 

&#8211; Net interest income of $21.8 billion, up 44%, driven by higher rates and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit 

balances. Net interest income excluding Markets was $22.4 billion, up 63%. 

&#8211; Noninterest revenue was $19.5 billion, up 25%, driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, higher Markets noninterest revenue and the absence of losses on equity investments in Payments in the prior year, partially offset by higher net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO. The impact of the First Republic acquisition included a $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain in Corporate. 

&#8211; Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower Markets NII, largely offset by higher NIR. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense was $20.8 billion, up 11%, driven by higher compensation expense due to additional headcount and the impact of wage inflation, $599 million expense associated with the First Republic acquisition, higher technology and marketing investments and higher legal expense. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion, reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses and $1.4 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments. The net addition also reflected: 

&#8211; $233 million in consumer predominantly in Card Services, and 

&#8211; $79 million in wholesale reflecting $389 million in CB, largely offset by a $243 million reduction in Corporate. 

Net charge-offs increased $754 million, predominantly driven by CCB, primarily Card Services , as 30+ day delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels. 

The prior year included a $428 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $657 million. 

&#8226; The total allowance for credit losses was $24.3 billion at June 30, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, compared with 1.69% in the prior year. 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s nonperforming assets totaled $7.8 billion at June 30, 2023, relatively flat from the prior year, as lower consumer nonaccrual loans due to loan sales in the prior year were offset by higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, reflecting client-specific downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79 for additional information. 

&#8226; Firmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%, driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, largely as a result of the First Republic acquisition. 

&#8226; Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down 6%, driven by: 

&#8211; the continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM; declines in CIB and CB primarily due to continued deposit attrition, which for CIB included actions to reduce certain deposits; and a net decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due to increased customer spending, 

partially offset by 

&#8211; the impact of the First Republic acquisition in CCB, and an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives. 

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 for additional information. 

Selected capital and other metrics 

&#8226; CET1 capital was $236 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.8% and 13.9%, respectively. 

&#8226; SLR was 5.8%. 

&#8226; TBVPS grew 15%, ending the second quarter of 2023 at $79.90. 

&#8226; As of June 30, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-of-period High Quality Liquid Assets (&#8220;HQLA&#8221;) of approximately $792 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $620 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 for additional information. 

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 10-15 and pages 16-19, respectively, for a further discussion of the Firm's results; and Business Segment Results on page 24 and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a further discussion of each of these measures.

Recent events 

&#8226; Basel III Finalization: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity". Under the proposal, changes would include replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. 

&#8226; GSIB Surcharge: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 for additional information. 

Outlook 

These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 95 of this Form 10-Q; Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K; and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209 of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s current outlook for full-year 2023 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. 

In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking recommending a special assessment related to the systemic risk determination made on March 12, 2023, to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured depositors resulting from recent bank resolutions. In its current form, the rule would impose a special assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points on certain banks&#8217; estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022. If this rule is finalized as proposed, the Firm expects to recognize an estimated assessment expense of approximately $3 billion (pre-tax) in the quarter in which the rule is finalized, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2023. 

Full-year 2023 

&#8226; Management expects both net interest income and net interest income excluding Markets to be approximately $87 billion, market dependent. 

&#8226; Management expects adjusted expense to be approximately $84.5 billion, market dependent and excluding any FDIC special assessment. 

&#8226; Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be approximately 2.6%. 

Net interest income excl uding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 . 

Business Developments 

First Republic acquisition 

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), as receiver, for $67.9 billion , resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion recorded in other income. In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note"), and entered into shared-loss agreements with the FDIC with respect to certain loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed in the acquisition. Refer to Note 28 for additional information. 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the period ended June 30, 2023 reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Where meaningful to the disclosure, the impact of the First Republic acquisition is disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-Q. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm&#8217;s businesses and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may change in future periods, including across the Firm's segments. 

Current market and economic conditions 

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of material risk factors that could affect the Firm. These risk factors include potential impacts to the Firm associated with current market and economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions (including secondary effects of the war in Ukraine), any or all of which could result in additional market disruption, government actions (including with respect to monetary policies), ongoing impacts to global supply chains, and other geopolitical risks. 

Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;IBOR&#8221;) transition 

The publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 (&#8220;LIBOR Cessation&#8221;). The one-month, three-month and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be published on a "synthetic" basis, which will allow market participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBOR-linked contracts through September 30, 2024. 

In the second quarter of 2023, the Firm successfully converted predominantly all of its cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as part of initiatives by the principal central counterparties (&#8220;CCPs&#8221;) to convert cleared derivatives prior to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm&#8217;s other U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR Cessation will be remediated through contractual fallback provisions or through the framework provided by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (&#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;). The Firm continues its client outreach activities with respect to the limited amount of contracts that continue to reference &#8220;synthetic&#8221; U.S. dollar LIBOR in order to complete remediation by September 30, 2024.

Quarterly results 

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting: 

&#8226; lower advisory fees due to a lower level of announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging environment, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; higher equity underwriting fees primarily due to higher convertible securities offerings and, in the second half of the quarter, follow-on offerings that benefited from the lower equity market volatility. 

Refer to C IB segment results on pages 30-36 and Note 6 for additional information. 

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting: 

&#8226; higher Equity Markets revenue in principal transactions, primarily in Prime Finance, 

&#8226; higher Fixed Income Markets revenue in principal transactions, driven by Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in Rates and Currencies &#38; Emerging Markets, 

&#8211; the increase in Markets principal transactions revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets NII, primarily due to higher funding costs 

&#8226; the absence of $337 million of markdowns in the prior year on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB, 

&#8226; a gain of $36 million in Credit Adjustments &#38; Other in CIB, compared with a loss of $218 million in the prior year, and 

&#8226; higher revenue related to cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year. 

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis. 

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 30-36, pages 37-40 and pages 45-46, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees decr eased due to: 

&#8226; lower cash management fees in CIB and CB associated with the higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; higher lending-related fees driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition in AWM and CCB.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased in Home Lending, reflecting lower production revenue due to a decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing revenue. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 25-29 and Notes 6 and 15 for additional information. 

Card income decreased driven by: 

&#8226; lower net interchange income as a result of an increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to the terms of certain reward programs in CCB, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; higher payments-related revenue, reflecting growth in Commercial Card in CIB and CB. 

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 25-29, pages 30-36 and pages 37-40, respectively, Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 91-93, and Note 6 for additional information.

&#8226; the $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition in Corporate, 

&#8226; the absence of losses on equity investments in Payments in the prior year, and 

&#8226; the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a decline in volume, and 

&#8226; the absence of a gain in the prior year on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan in CB . 

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 24 and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition; and Note 5 for additional information on net investment hedges.

Year-to-date results 

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting: 

&#8226; lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity in acquisition financing , and 

&#8226; lower advisory fees due to a lower level of announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging environment, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher equity underwriting fees primarily due to higher convertible securities offerings and, in the second half of the second quarter, follow-on offerings that benefited from the lower equity market volatility. 

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting: 

&#8226; higher Fixed Income Markets net revenue in principal transactions, driven by Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in Currencies &#38; Emerging Markets and Rates , 

&#8226; higher Equity Markets revenue in principal transactions, primarily in Prime Finance, 

&#8211; the increase in Markets principal transactions revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets NII, primarily due to higher funding costs 

&#8226; losses of $117 million in Credit Adjustments &#38; Other in CIB, driven by losses on certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, compared with losses of $742 million in the prior year, and 

&#8226; higher revenue related to cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees decr eased due to: 

&#8226; lower cash management fees in CB and CIB associated with the higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher lending-related fees driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition in AWM and CCB. 

Asset management fees in creased driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition in CCB. 

A sset management fees in AWM was relatively flat, as the decline in market levels was predominantly offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers and the impact of net inflows. 

Commissions and other fees was relatively flat. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 30-36 and pages 41-44, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. 

Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in both periods in Treasury and CIO. 

Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by 

Home Lending, reflecting lower production revenue due to a decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing revenue due to lower net gains in MSR risk management. 

Card income increased driven by higher payments-related revenue, reflecting growth in Commercial Card in CIB and CB. 

Net interchange income in CCB was relatively flat as the benefit in partner payments in the first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed was offset by an increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to the terms of certain reward programs. 

Other income in creased, reflecting: 

&#8226; the $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition in Corporate, 

&#8226; the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, and 

&#8226; a gain of $339 million recognized in first quarter of 2023 in AWM on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a decline in volume, 

&#8226; the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an insurance settlement, 

&#8226; the absence of a gain in the prior year on an equity-method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan in CB, and 

&#8226; lower net gains related to certain other Corporate investments . 

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and, to a lesser extent, higher revolving balances in Card Services and the impact from the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit balances. 

The Firm&#8217;s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 trillion, down $113 billion, and the yield was 4.85%, up 281 basis points (&#8220;bps&#8221;). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.63%, an increase of 89 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.82%, up 171 bps.

Consolidated balance sheets analysis 

The following is a discussion of the significant changes between June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Assets Cash and due from banks $ 26,064 &#160; $ 27,697 (6) % Deposits with banks 469,059 &#160; 539,537 (13) Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 325,628 &#160; 315,592 3 Securities borrowed 163,563 &#160; 185,369 (12) Trading assets 636,996 &#160; 453,799 40 Available-for-sale securities 203,262 &#160; 205,857 (1) Held-to-maturity securities 408,941 &#160; 425,305 (4) Investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses 612,203 &#160; 631,162 (3) Loans 1,300,069 &#160; 1,135,647 14 Allowance for loan losses (21,980) (19,726) (11) Loans, net of allowance for loan losses 1,278,089 &#160; 1,115,921 15 Accrued interest and accounts receivable 111,561 &#160; 125,189 (11) Premises and equipment 29,493 &#160; 27,734 6 Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets 64,238 &#160; 60,859 6 Other assets 151,346 &#160; 182,884 (17) Total assets $ 3,868,240 &#160; $ 3,665,743 6 % 

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks decreased primarily as a result of the First Republic acquisition, which included the impact of the repayment of deposits provided to First Republic Bank in March 2023 by the consortium of large U.S. banks and amounts paid to the FDIC, as well as CIB Markets activities. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm&#8217;s placement of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks. 

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements increased due to the impact of a lower level of netting on a reduced level of resale balances in Markets. 

Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets, reflecting lower client-driven activities and lower demand for securities to cover short positions. 

Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. 

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt and equity instruments in Markets, in response to demand from client-driven market-making activities, and when compared with the seasonally lower levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information. 

Investment securities decreased due to: 

&#8226; lower available-for-sale ("AFS") securities driven by paydowns, maturities and net sales, partially offset by $25.8 billion of securities associated with the First Republic acquisition as well as the transfer of securities from held-to-maturity in the first quarter of 2023 (&#8220;HTM&#8221;), and 

&#8226; lower HTM securities driven by paydowns, maturities and the transfer of securities to AFS.

Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 83 , and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information. 

Loans increased, reflecting : 

&#8226; $150 billion of loans associated with the First Republic acquisition, primarily reflected in CCB, CB and AWM. 

The increase also included: 

&#8226; growth in new accounts and revolving balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels in Card Services, and 

&#8226; higher revolver utilization and originations in CB, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower securities-based lending in AWM. 

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting: 

&#8226; a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $1.8 billion, c onsisting of: 

&#8211; $1.1 billion in wholesale, predominantly driven by net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and 

&#8211; $620 million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, and 

&#8226; $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023. 

The allowance for loan losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a result of the adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. References in this Form 10-Q to "changes to the TDR accounting guidance" pertain to the Firm's adoption of this guidance. 

There was also a $196 million net reduction in the allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which included a $97 million addition to establish the allowance for the First Republic lending-related commitments . 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 62-83, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional information on loans and the total allowance for credit losses; and Business Segment Results on page 24 and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. 

Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased primarily due to lower client receivables related to client-driven activities in Markets. 

Premises and equipment increased as a result of the First Republic acquisition, largely lease right-of-use assets, and the construction-in-process associated with the Firm's headquarters. Refer to Note 17 for information on leases. 

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets increased predominantly due to the other intangibles and goodwill related to the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM, and the core deposit intangibles associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note 15 and 28 for additional information. 

Other assets decreased reflecting lower cash collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCPs").

Deposits increased, reflecting: 

&#8226; increases in CIB due to deposit inflows related to client-driven activities and net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, 

&#8226; $68 billion of deposits in CCB associated with the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by a net decline primarily in existing accounts due to increased customer spending, and 

&#8226; an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; the continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment , and 

&#8226; ongoing attrition in CB driven by higher rates and seasonal outflows, predominantly offset by inflows as a result of disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023 . 

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements in creased due to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets.

Trading liabilities : refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information. 

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased primarily due to lower client payables related to client-driven activities in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 and Notes 14 and 24 for add itional information, specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts. 

Long-term debt increased, reflecting the impact of the First Republic acquisition, which included the Purchase Money Note issued to the FDIC, and $25 billion of FHLB advances, partially offset by maturities and redemptions in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61; and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM&#8217;S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as &#8220;reported&#8221; basis; these financial statements appear on pages 96-100. 

In addition to analyzing the Firm&#8217;s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments &#8211; Consumer &#38; Community Banking, Corporate &#38; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &#38; Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. 

The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm&#8217;s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm&#8217;s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a definition of managed basis. 

Description of business segment reporting methodology 

Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm&#8217;s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. 

Revenue sharing 

When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm&#8217;s clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements. 

Funds transfer pricing 

Funds transfer pricing (&#8220;FTP&#8221;) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. 

The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. 

Foreign exchange risk 

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89 for additional information. 

Capital allocation 

The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business equity on page 51 , and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation. 

Refer to Business Segment Results &#8211; Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62 and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.

Quarterly results 

Net income was $5.3 billion, up 71%. 

Net revenue was $17.2 billion, an increase of 37%. 

Net interest income was $13.7 billion, up 57%, driven by: 

&#8226; deposit margin expansion on higher rates in Banking &#38; Wealth Management ("BWM"), and 

&#8226; higher NII in Card Services driven by increased revolving balances. 

Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, down 8%, driven by: 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, and 

&#8226; a decrease in card income driven by lower net interchange, as a result of an increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to certain reward program terms, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher asset management fees in BWM predominantly driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition. 

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income, asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 91-93 for card income. 

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. 

Noninterest expense was $8.3 billion, up 9%, driven by: 

&#8226; higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and headcount growth, as well as higher marketing and technology, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, and included: 

&#8226; net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, up $640 million, predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and 

&#8226; a $611 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting $408 million to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments. The net addition also included $203 million driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, and the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, largely offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. 

The prior year included a $150 million addition to the allowance for credit losses in Card Services. 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 80-82 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses. 

Year-to-date results 

Net income was $10.5 billion, up 75%. 

Net revenue was $33.7 billion, an increase of 36%. 

Net interest income was $26.5 billion, up 56%, driven by: 

&#8226; deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits in BWM, and 

&#8226; higher NII in Card Services driven by increased revolving balances, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; the impact of lower PPP loan forgiveness in BWM. 

Noninterest revenue was $7.2 billion, down 7%, driven by: 

&#8226; lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume and 

&#8226; in Home Lending, lower production revenue from a decline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing revenue predominantly driven by lower net gains on MSR risk management, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher travel-related commissions in Card Services, 

&#8226; higher asset management fees in BWM driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition. 

Card income was relatively flat as the increase in net interchange in the first quarter of 2023 due to a reduction in rewards costs and partner payments related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed was offset by an increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023. 

Noninterest expense was $16.4 billion, up 7%, driven by: 

&#8226; higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and headcount growth, as well as higher marketing and technology, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, and included: 

&#8226; net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, up $1.1 billion, predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and 

&#8226; a $553 million net addition, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, and 

&#8226; a $408 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments, in the second quarter of 2023. 

The prior year included a $275 million addition to the allowance for credit losses in Card Services and Home Lending.

(a) Consists primarily of centrally managed credit valuation adjustments (&#8220;CVA&#8221;), funding valuation adjustments (&#8220;FVA&#8221;) on derivatives, other valuation adjustments, and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, which are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. 

(b) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

Quarterly results 

Net income was $4.1 billion, up 10%. 

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, up 4%. 

Banking revenue was $4.2 billion, up 29%. 

&#8226; Investment Banking revenue was $1.5 billion, up 11%. Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio recorded in the prior year, Investment Banking revenue was down 7%. Investment Banking fees were down 6%, driven by lower advisory fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic. 

&#8211; Advisory fees were $540 million, down 19%, due to a lower level of announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging environment. 

&#8211; D ebt underwriting fees were $699 million, down 6%, as challenging market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity in the leveraged loan market primarily related to acquisition financing. 

&#8211; Equity underwriting fees were $318 million, up 30%, primarily due to higher convertible securities offerings and, in the second half of the quarter, follow-on offerings that benefited from the lower equity market volatility. 

&#8226; Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61%. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, Payments revenue was up 32%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits. 

&#8226; Lending revenue was $299 million, down 27%, and included $80 million of fair value losses on hedges of retained loans. 

Markets &#38; Securities Services revenue was $8.3 billion, down 5%. Markets revenue was $7.0 billion, down 10%. 

&#8226; Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.6 billion, down 3%, reflecting lower revenue in Currencies &#38; Emerging Markets, Commodities and Rates as the macro businesses substantially normalized from the prior year's elevated levels of volatility and client activity, largely offset by higher revenue in the Securitized Products Group and Credit Trading. 

&#8226; Equity Markets revenue was $2.5 billion, down 20%, predominantly driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives, compared to a strong second quarter in the prior year. 

&#8226; Securities Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower fees and lower average deposits. 

&#8226; Credit Adjustments &#38; Other was a gain of $36 million, compared with a loss of $218 million in the prior year, largely driven by funding spread widening. 

Noninterest expense was $6.9 billion, up 1%, driven by higher non-compensation expense, as well as wage inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. 

The provision for credit losses was $38 million, including net charge-offs of $56 million. 

The prior year provision was $59 million.

&#8226; Payments revenue was $4.8 billion, up 42%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits.

Markets &#38; Securities Services revenue was $17.7 billion, down 2%. Markets revenue was $15.4 billion, down 7%.

Markets revenue 

The following table summarizes selected income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information. 

For the periods presented below, the primary source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Quarterly results 

Net income was $1.2 billion, up 22%. 

Net revenue was $4.0 billion, up 49%. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, up 77%, predominantly driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and higher average loans, partially offset by lower average deposits. 

Noninterest revenue was $835 million, down 8%, driven by lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees, partially offset by higher card income. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, up 12%, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including headcount growth, as well as higher volume-related expense. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion, reflecting an addition of $608 million to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments. The net addition also reflected $389 million driven by updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate, as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. 

The prior year provision was $209 million.

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 14%, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including headcount growth, as well as higher volume-related expense. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion, reflecting an addition of $608 million to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments, in the second quarter of 2023.

&#8226; lower NII due to higher funding costs, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; higher management fees on strong net inflows. 

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.8 billion, up 30%, predominantly driven by: 

&#8226; deposit margin expansion reflecting higher rates on lower average deposit balances, and 

&#8226; higher lending-related fees and average loans driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition. 

Noninterest expense was $3.2 billion, up 8%, driven by higher compensation, including growth in private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and 

the impact from the acquisitions of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China.

Net revenue was $9.7 billion, up 13%. Net interest income was $3.0 billion, up 32%. Noninterest revenue was $6.7 billion, up 6%.

&#8226; a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, 

largely offset by 

&#8226; lower NII driven by higher funding costs,

&#8226; lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in market levels predominantly offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year and the impact of net inflows. 

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $5.2 billion, up 24%, driven by: 

&#8226; deposit margin expansion reflecting higher rates on lower average deposit balances, and

partially offset by 

&#8226; an investment valuation loss in the first quarter of 2023.

Quarterly results 

Net income was $2.6 billion, compared with a net loss of $174 million in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $3.7 billion, compared with $80 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower Firmwide average deposit balances available for deployment in Treasury and CIO . 

Noninterest revenue was $2.0 billion, compared with a loss of $244 million in the prior year, driven by: 

&#8226; a $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition 

&#8226; higher revenue related to cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, and 

&#8226; higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues associated with foreign exchange rate movements, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio, and 

&#8226; net losses on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in the prior year 

Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was up $946 million driven by expense of $562 million associated with the First Republic acquisition , higher legal expense, and a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements. 

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that was transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and 

expense were not material to net income. Refer to Foreign Exchange Risk on page 22 for additional information. 

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit losses associated with the deposit placed with First Republic Bank in the first quarter of 2023. 

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio, and Note 13 for additional information on the allowance for credit losses. 

The current period tax expense benefited from the income tax expense associated with the First Republic acquisition reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain, partially offset by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impact the Firm&#8217;s tax reserves. 

Year-to-date results 

Net income was $2.9 billion, compared with a net loss of $1.0 billion in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $4.7 billion, compared with a loss of $801 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income due to higher rates, partially offset by lower Firmwide average deposit balances available for deployment in Treasury and CIO. 

Noninterest revenue was $1.2 billion, compared with a loss of $589 million, driven by: 

&#8226; a $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the First Republic acquisition, 

&#8226; higher revenue related to cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, and 

&#8226; higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues associated with foreign exchange rate movements, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; higher net investment securities losses related to the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio, 

&#8226; the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an insurance settlement, and 

&#8226; lower net gains related to certain other Corporate investments. 

Noninterest expense of $1.3 billion was up $922 million driven by expense of $562 million associated with the First Republic acquisition , higher legal expense, and a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements. 

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that was transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expense were not material to net income. Refer to Foreign Exchange Risk on page 22 for additional information. 

The current period tax expense benefited from the income tax expense associated with the First Republic acquisition reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain, largely offset by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impact the Firm&#8217;s tax reserves. 

Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm&#8217;s overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things: 

&#8226; Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 

&#8226; Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

&#8226; A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure. 

The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm&#8217;s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance framework 

The Firm&#8217;s risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. 

Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and oversight. 

Risk governance and oversight functions 

The following sections of this Form 10-Q and the 2022 Form 10-K discuss the risk governance and oversight functions in place to manage the risks inherent in the Firm&#8217;s business activities.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm&#8217;s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions. 

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K, Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm&#8217;s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm&#8217;s website, for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s capital risk. 

Basel III Overview 

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (&#8220;BHCs&#8221;) and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (&#8220;IDI&#8221;) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets ("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (&#8220;Basel III Standardized&#8221;), and an advanced approach (&#8220;Basel III Advanced&#8221;). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm&#8217;s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51 for additional information. 

Key Regulatory Developments 

CECL regulatory capital transition 

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining $1.4 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. 

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions and the CECL accounting guidance. 

Risk-based Capital Targets 

The Firm&#8217;s target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio for the first quarter of 2024 remains at 13.5%. The Firm&#8217;s quarterly capital ratios may vary from the target dependent on market conditions. The target is based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect. 

Basel III Finalization 

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity". Under the proposal, changes would include replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. 

GSIB Surcharge 

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would also be other technical amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer to Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 89-90 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the GSIB surcharge. 

The following tables present the Firm&#8217;s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 23 for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics. First Republic Bank was not subject to Advanced approach regulatory capital requirements. As a result, for certain exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition, Advanced RWA and any impact on Advanced Total capital is calculated under the Standardized approach as permitted by the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm&#8217;s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm&#8217;s website, for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s liquidity risk. 

LCR and HQLA 

The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. 

Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm&#8217;s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. 

The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022 based on the Firm&#8217;s interpretation of the LCR framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. 

(b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule. 

(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets. 

(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

(e) End-of-period HQLA balances were $791.5 billion, $758.9 billion, and $721.1 billion for June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. 

The Firm&#8217;s average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the three months period ended March 31, 2023, due to long-term debt maturities, common stock repurchases and common stock 

dividends paid, predominantly offset by a dividend payment from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company. 

The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the prior year period, driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company, partially offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting an approximate 50% decline associated with the First Republic acquisition, reducing HQLA and increasing net cash outflows. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s HQLA was further impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by higher average loans, a dividend payment to the Parent Company, and a decline in average deposits. 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2023 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a decline in average deposits and loan growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities and the impact of the First Republic acquisition. 

Refer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First Republic acquisition. 

Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. 

Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm&#8217;s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. 

Internal stress testing 

The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm&#8217;s resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm&#8217;s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. 

The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (&#8220;IHC&#8221;), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to 

manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted. 

Other liquidity sources 

In addition to the assets reported in the Firm&#8217;s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $620 billion and $694 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely offset by an increase in CIB trading assets and AFS securities associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLBs&#8221;) and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $332 billion and $323 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm&#8217;s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. 

NSFR 

The net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of &#8220;available&#8221; stable funding that is sufficient to meet their &#8220;required&#8221; amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's current interpretation of the final rule. By the end of August 2023, the Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR on a semiannual basis. 

Funding 

Sources of funds 

Management believes that the Firm&#8217;s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements. 

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders&#8217; equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The 

Firm&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm&#8217;s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm&#8217;s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm&#8217;s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. 

Average deposits were lower for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven by: 

&#8226; the continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment, 

&#8226; continued deposit attrition in CIB, including actions to reduce certain deposits, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, 

&#8226; continued deposit attrition in CB, partially offset by continued inflows as a result of disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023, and 

&#8226; a net decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due to increased customer spending, largely offset by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives. 

Average deposits were lower for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was driven by: 

&#8226; the continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment, 

&#8226; continued deposit attrition in CIB, including actions to reduce certain deposits, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, 

&#8226; continued deposit attrition in CB, partially offset by continued inflows as a result of disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023, and 

&#8226; a net decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due to increased customer spending, partially offset by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives. 

Period-end deposits increased, reflecting: 

&#8226; increases in CIB due to deposit inflows related to client-driven activities and net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand, 

&#8226; $68 billion of deposits in CCB associated with the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by a net decline primarily in existing accounts due to increased customer spending, and 

&#8226; an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer initiatives, 

partially offset by 

&#8226; the continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest rate environment, and 

&#8226; ongoing attrition in CB driven by higher rates and seasonal outflows, predominantly offset by inflows as a result of disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (a) , the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,381.1 billion and $1,353.1 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits. 

Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm&#8217;s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

(g) As of June 30, 2023, included FHLB advances with original maturities of less than one year of $2.3 billion associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note 28 for additional information. 

Short-term funding 

The Firm&#8217;s sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher secured financing of trading assets and the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven market-making activities in Markets. 

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm&#8217;s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm&#8217;s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors. 

The Firm&#8217;s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds. 

The decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2023 from December 31, 2022, and for the average three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year periods, was due to lower net issuance levels resulting from short-term liquidity management. 

The decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year periods was due to a lower level of overdrafts as well as net maturities of structured notes classified as other borrowed funds in CIB. 

Long-term funding and issuance 

Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm&#8217;s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm&#8217;s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 18 of this Form 10-Q and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

The Firm&#8217;s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations. 

Credit ratings 

The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 

and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades. 

Additionally, the Firm&#8217;s funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note 5 and Note 14 for additional information. 

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm&#8217;s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2023, were as follows:

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT 

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 

wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit Portfolio and 

Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 65-82 for a further discussion of Credit Risk. 

Refer to page 83 for a further discussion of Investment Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s Credit and Investment Risk Management framework. 

CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. 

In the following tables, total loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 24 and 5 for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables. 

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the Firm&#8217;s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 65-69 and Note 12 for further discussions of the consumer credit environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79 and Note 12 for further discussions of the wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans. 

On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will differ from those previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

Consumer, excluding credit card 

Portfolio analysis 

Loans increased compared to December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate loans associated with the First Republic acquisition and higher auto loans. 

Residential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. 

Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2022, reflecting residential real estate loans associated with the First Republic acquisition. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared to December 31, 2022. Net recoveries were lower for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates. 

Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2022, driven by a decrease in CIB due to sales outpacing purchases largely offset by an increase in Home Lending as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual loans at fair value were relatively flat compared to December 31, 2022. 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $90.0 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. The increase was driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio and there were no charge-offs associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $16.9 billion at June 30, 2023, which included $2.6 billion associated with the First Republic acquisition. The carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding included $4.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $4.7 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile. 

The following table provides a summary of the Firm&#8217;s residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses. 

(in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Current $ 614 &#160; $ 659 30-89 days past due 112 &#160; 136 90 or more days past due 215 &#160; 302 Total government guaranteed loans $ 941 &#160; $ 1,097 

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans 

At June 30, 2023, $229.8 billion, or 70% of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion, or 62% at December 31, 2022. 

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm&#8217;s residential real estate loans. 

Modified residential real estate loans 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $35 million and $75 million, respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $33 million and $48 million of loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified, as well as $3 million and $5 million of loans subject to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings ("Chapter 7 loans") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, residential real estate TDRs were $115 million and $233 million, respectively. Refer to Note 12 for further information on TDRs in prior periods. 

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022 due to originations of scored Auto loans and an increase in other consumer unsecured fair value option loans associated with the First Republic acquisition, largely offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to higher scored Auto charge-offs as delinquency levels normalized and vehicle valuations declined. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.41% and 0.12% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 0.43% and 0.15% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(a) Other reductions include loan sales. 

Refer to Note 12 for further information about the consumer credit portfolio, including information about delinquencies, other credit quality indicators, loan modifications and loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. 

Credit card 

Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2022 reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. The June 30, 2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.70% and 0.84%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68% respectively, and net charge-offs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in the prior year as 30+ day delinquencies have normalized. 

Consistent with the Firm&#8217;s policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies. 

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans 

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the Firm&#8217;s credit card loans. 

Modifications of credit card loans 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, credit card FDMs were $181 million and $326 million, respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $26 million of loans subject to trial modification where the terms of the loans have not been permanently modified for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, credit card TDRs were $81 million and $163 million, respectively. 

Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information. 

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm&#8217;s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 72-75 for further information. 

The Firm&#8217;s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition to align with the Firm&#8217;s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 9 for additional information. 

As of June 30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming exposure was driven by loans, resulting from client-specific downgrades in CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction in lending-related commitments. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, wholesale charge-offs remained low, despite an increase in charge-offs in the second quarter of 2023 concentrated in Office real estate. 

As of June 30, 2023, retained loans increased $64.5 billion predominantly driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Lending-related commitments increased $69.1 billion driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, and net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio.

In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position as of June 30, 2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions. 

Wholesale credit exposure &#8211; industry exposures 

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $35.0 billion and $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, representing approximately 2.8% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively . Criticized exposure increased, driven by client-specific downgrades largely in Real Estate, Consumer and Retail, Technology, Media &#38; Telecommunications, and Healthcare, as well as exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of the $35.0 billion of criticized exposure at June 30, 2023, approximately half was undrawn and $31.8 billion was performing. 

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm&#8217;s exposures as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty&#8217;s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on industry concentrations.

Lending-related commitments 

The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm&#8217;s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 24 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments. 

Receivables from customers 

Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients&#8217; brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets. 

Derivative contracts 

Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (&#8220;ETD&#8221;), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC-cleared&#8221;) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house (&#8220;CCP&#8221;). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. 

The percentage of the Firm&#8217;s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements &#8212; excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily &#8212; was approximately 88% and 87% at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types. 

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $64.2 billion and $70.9 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by market movements in CIB Markets. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. 

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client&#8217;s exposure is in the Firm&#8217;s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. 

In management&#8217;s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty. 

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client&#8217;s derivative contracts move in the Firm&#8217;s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s use of collateral agreements for derivatives transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities 

The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm&#8217;s own credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm&#8217;s wholesale businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

The Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally consists of : 

&#8226; the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm&#8217;s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), 

&#8226; the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and 

&#8226; the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

Discussion of changes in the allowance 

The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2023 was $24.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.7 billion from December 31, 2022. 

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.5 billion, consisting of: 

&#8226; $819 million in wholesale , predominantly driven by net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and 

&#8226; $649 million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. 

The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 

The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting an increased probability of a moderate recession due to tightening financial conditions. 

The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information. 

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.5% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The Firm&#8217;s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: 

Assumptions at June 30, 2023 4Q23 2Q24 4Q24 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

4.2 % 4.9 % 5.0 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

0.5 % &#8212; % 1.0 % Assumptions at December 31, 2022 2Q23 4Q23 2Q24 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

3.8 % 4.3 % 5.0 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

1.5 % 0.4 % &#8212; % 

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. 

(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. 

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods. 

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses on loans, lending-related commitments, and investment securities.

(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the Firm's adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information. 

(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans. 

(c) At June 30, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had an allowance for credit losses of $18 million associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB. 

(d) As of June 30, 2023 included$1.2 billion allowance for credit losses associated with the First Republic acquisition.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments. 

Investment securities risk 

Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $610.2 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 45-46 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. 

Principal investment risk 

Principal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm&#8217;s business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm&#8217;s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm&#8217;s investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm&#8217;s commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses. 

The table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s Market Risk Management organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring and control, and predominant business activities that give rise to market risk. 

Models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm&#8217;s existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time. 

Value-at-risk 

JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. 

The Firm&#8217;s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (&#8220;Regulatory VaR&#8221;), which is used to derive the Firm&#8217;s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm&#8217;s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm&#8217;s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm&#8217;s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for information regarding model reviews and approvals. 

Refer to page 133 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information regarding VaR, including the inherent limitations, and the key differences between Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm&#8217;s website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages 136-138 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information regarding nonstatistical market risk measures used by the Firm. 

The table below shows the results of the Firm&#8217;s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a) Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components. 

(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures. 

(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded. 

(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and related hedges. 

(e) For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first quarter of 2022. 

Quarter over quarter results 

Average total VaR was flat for the three months ended June 30, 2023, when compared with March 31, 2023, reflecting increases in fixed income offset by market volatility relating to commodities rolling out of the one-year historical look-back period. 

Year over year results 

Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in the prior year predominantly driven by risk reductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR as well as fixed income. 

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters.

Second Quarter 2022 Third Quarter 2022 Fourth Quarter 2022 First Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2023 

VaR backtesting 

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm&#8217;s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules. 

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm&#8217;s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. 

For the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 134 of the 259 days, and observed 15 VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 34 of the 65 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions. 

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended June 30, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm&#8217;s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm&#8217;s covered positions. 

Distribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses 

Structural interest rate risk management 

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm&#8217;s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm&#8217;s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm&#8217;s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. 

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm&#8217;s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (&#8220;non-U.S. dollar&#8221; currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including: 

&#8226; The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates. 

&#8226; Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such 

as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits. 

&#8226; The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The model change incorporated observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits. 

The Firm&#8217;s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm&#8217;s simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm&#8217;s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm&#8217;s net interest income. Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional information. 

The Firm&#8217;s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. 

(in billions) June 30, 2023 (a) 

December 31, 2022 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 2.5 &#160; $ (2.0) -100 bps shift in rates (2.2) 2.4 Steeper yield curve: +100 bps shift in long-term rates 0.6 &#160; 0.8 -100 bps shift in short-term rates (1.6) 3.2 Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 1.8 &#160; (2.8) -100 bps shift in long-term rates (0.6) (0.9) 

(a) Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior periods have not been revised. 

In the absence of the model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2023, would have been lower by $4.2 billion to the +100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by $4.4 billion to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios. 

In addition, the change in the Firm&#8217;s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 reflected the impact of changes in the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet including the impact of the First Republic acquisition. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Firm&#8217;s sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing. 

The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate products associated with the First Republic acquisition to align with the Firm&#8217;s business and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain products associated with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, earnings-at-risk results may be impacted in future periods. 

The Firm&#8217;s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below. 

(in billions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Parallel shift: +100 bps shift in rates $ 0.8 &#160; $ 0.7 -100 bps shift in rates (0.8) (0.6) Steeper yield curve: -100 bps shift in short-term rates (0.7) (0.6) Flatter yield curve: +100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.8 &#160; 0.6 

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm&#8217;s earnings-at-risk at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . 

In addition to earnings-at-risk, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity (EVS). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm&#8217;s current balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with the CTC structural interest rate risk policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE.

Other sensitivity-based measures 

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures. 

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management&#8217;s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT 

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm&#8217;s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm&#8217;s exposures are diversified given the Firm&#8217;s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. 

Refer to pages 139-140 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s country risk management. 

Risk Reporting 

The following table presents the Firm&#8217;s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2023 and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries represents the Firm&#8217;s largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm&#8217;s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm&#8217;s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows. 

The increases in exposures to Germany and the United Kingdom were primarily driven by increases in cash placed with the central banks of those countries, due to client-driven activities, including as a result of changes in interest rates. 

The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates. 

The Firm continues to monitor potential impacts to the Firm associated with the war in Ukraine. As of June 30, 2023, exposure to Russia was approximately $430 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm&#8217;s most complex accounting estimates require management&#8217;s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm&#8217;s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm&#8217;s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. 

Allowance for credit losses 

The Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm&#8217;s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally consists of: 

&#8226; The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm&#8217;s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated). 

&#8226; The allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and 

&#8226; The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm&#8217;s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses; and refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82 and Note 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information. 

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm&#8217;s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 

variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography. 

&#8226; Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment and HPI. 

&#8226; Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI. 

Changes in the Firm&#8217;s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. 

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the First Republic Portfolio, and the ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm&#8217;s modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real estate that has more commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others. 

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. 

For example, compared to the Firm&#8217;s central scenario shown on page 80 and in Note 13, the Firm&#8217;s relative adverse scen 

ario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.6% higher 

over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 

2.2% in the first quarter of 2024; lower 

U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining approximately 3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.4% in the third quarter of 2024; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately 10.5% in the first quarter of 2025. 

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including: 

&#8226; The allowance as of June 30, 2023, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios. 

&#8226; The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 

&#8226; Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses. 

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences: 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $750 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments, including the First Republic portfolios 

&#8226; An increase of approximately $2.4 billion for credit card loans 

&#9642; An increase of approximately $3.8 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments, excluding the First Republic portfolios. 

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions. 

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2023. 

Fair value 

JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. 

Assets measured at fair value 

The following table includes the Firm&#8217;s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $10.7 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. 

Valuation 

Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2. 

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used. 

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm&#8217;s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm. 

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm&#8217;s businesses and portfolios. 

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm&#8217;s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. 

Credit card rewards liability 

The credit card rewards liability was $12.2 billion and $11.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter. Refer to pages 151-152 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions and sensitivities, associated with the Firm&#8217;s credit card rewards liability. 

Income taxes 

Refer to Income taxes on page 152 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes. 

Goodwill impairment 

Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment. 

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2023. 

Litigation reserves

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 

Note 1 &#8211; Basis of presentation 

JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8221; or the &#8220;Firm&#8221;), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the &#8220;First Republic acquisition&#8221;) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm&#8217;s businesses and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, products and services associated with the First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may change in future periods including across the Firm's segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s business segments and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. 

The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. 

The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. 

These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K. 

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

Consolidation 

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. 

Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s accounting policies regarding consolidation. 

Offsetting assets and liabilities 

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. 

Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 

Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging &#8211; Portfolio Layer Method 

The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. 

Refer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information. 

Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post- 

modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. 

The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach. 

This guidance was adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587 million and an increase to retained earnings of $ 446 million, after-tax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. 

The adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as financial difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will differ from those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year.

(a) At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 93.5 billion and $ 73.8 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related. 

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. &#8220;Net realizable value&#8221; is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (&#8220;transaction costs&#8221;). Transaction costs for the Firm&#8217;s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm&#8217;s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented. 

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions). 

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $ 956 million and $ 950 million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 40 million and $ 43 million, respectively, and other assets of $ 916 million and $ 907 million, respectively. 

(e) At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $ 9.3 billion and $ 9.7 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.8 billion of commercial first-lien mortgages for both periods. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.3 billion and $ 2.4 billion, respectively. 

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral. 

Level 3 valuations 

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm&#8217;s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. 

The following table presents the Firm&#8217;s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. 

In the Firm&#8217;s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm&#8217;s estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ. 

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 706 million, nonagency securities of $ 5 million and non-trading loans of $ 930 million. 

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 6 million, trading loans of $ 72 million and non-trading loans of $ 2.2 billion. 

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 1.0 billion and non-trading loans of $ 638 million. 

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables. 

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 843 million including $ 213 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate. 

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $ 100 . 

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price. 

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used. 

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs 

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm&#8217;s positions. 

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 

The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm&#8217;s risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $ 286 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2023, $ 220 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares. 

(b) Of the $ 840 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2023, $ 23 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from broker&#8217;s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm&#8217;s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 3 % to 56 % with a weighted average of 25 %.

Refer to Note 12 for further information about the measurement of collateral-dependent loans. 

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income. 

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm&#8217;s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm&#8217;s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. 

The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $ 4.1 billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes. 

(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were $ 1.5 billion. 

(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2023 were $( 1.0 ) billion. 

Included in other assets above is the Firm&#8217;s interest in approximately 37 million Visa Class B common shares (&#8220;Visa B shares&#8221;). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (&#8220;Visa A shares&#8221;) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. On June 29, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5991 to 1.5902 effective June 28, 2023. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. 

In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm&#8217;s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan&#8217;s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan&#8217;s expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 

(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in level 3 of Long-term debt associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 18 and 28 for additional information. 

The majority of the Firm&#8217;s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(c) As of June 30, 2023, includes fair value adjustments associated with the First Republic acquisition for other unfunded commitments to extend credit totaling $ 1.6 billion. Refer to Notes 24 and 28 for additional information. 

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 169 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments. 

Note 3 &#8211; Fair value option 

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments. 

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis. 

The Firm&#8217;s election of fair value includes the following instruments: 

&#8226; Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments 

&#8226; Certain securities financing agreements 

&#8226; Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument 

&#8226; Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities 

&#8226; Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB&#8217;s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value 

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election 

The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. 

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes. 

(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm&#8217;s next call date. 

At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $ 10.2 billion and $ 7.6 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $ 264 million and $ 24 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 &#8211; Credit risk concentrations 

Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. 

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm&#8217;s agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm&#8217;s risk appetite. 

In the Firm&#8217;s consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm&#8217;s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis. 

The Firm&#8217;s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. 

The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. 

Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm&#8217;s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses. 

The table below presents both on&#8211;balance sheet and off&#8211;balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the Firm&#8217;s three credit portfolio segments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The wholesale industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty&#8217;s primary business activity.

(c) Individuals and Individual Entities predominantly consists of Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB, and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts. 

(d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, noted above, the Firm held: $ 6.8 billion and $ 6.6 billion, respectively, of trading assets; $ 24.0 billion and $ 6.8 billion, respectively, of AFS securities; and $ 11.6 billion and $ 19.7 billion, respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments. Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for further information. 

(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 94 % and 6 %, respectively, as of June 30, 2023 and 95 % and 5 %, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 14 for more information on exposures to SPEs. 

(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients&#8217; brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets. 

(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 485.4 billion and $ 556.6 billion, as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks. 

(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables. 

(i) Included credit exposure associated with the First Republic acquisition consisting of $ 104.6 billion in the Consumer, excluding credit card portfolio, and $ 98.2 billion in the Wholesale portfolio predominantly in Asset Managers, Real Estate, and Individuals and Individual Entities. 

(j) Represents lending-related financial instruments. 

Note 5 &#8211; Derivative instruments 

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. 

The Firm&#8217;s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm&#8217;s derivatives are designated in hedge 

accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm&#8217;s market-making businesses or for other purposes. 

The following table outlines the Firm&#8217;s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.

(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. 

Derivatives netting 

The following tables present, as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below. 

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm&#8217;s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: 

&#8226; collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as &#8220;Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets&#8221; in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 

&#8226; the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and 

&#8226; collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features 

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm&#8217;s derivative contracts. 

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a) Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin. 

(b) Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted. 

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset 

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income 

The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose. 

Fair value hedge gains and losses 

The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. 

(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items. 

(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income. 

(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue. 

(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. 

(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. 

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 12.8 billion and $ 26.0 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods. 

(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 20.9 billion and $ 20.3 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 216 million and $ 221 million, respectively. 

(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At June 30, 2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 67.8 billion, of which $ 49.6 billion was designated as hedged. The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $( 1.1 ) billion, reflecting $( 865 ) million and $( 229 ) million for active and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information. 

(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods. 

(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. 

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.3 ) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at June 30, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years , corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years . The Firm&#8217;s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

Credit derivatives 

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm&#8217;s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date. 

(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $( 30 ) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 865 ) million at June 30, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $( 74 ) million at June 30, 2023. 

(c) Substantially all of the Firm&#8217;s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, seven years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations. 

(d) Includes AFS securities associated with the First Republic acquisition, primarily impacting due after 10 years. Refer to Note 28 for additional information. 

Note 11 &#8211; Securities financing activities 

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 25 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. 

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm&#8217;s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance 

sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as &#8220;Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,&#8221; and reduces the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting 

At both June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Firm held $ 692 million of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

Note 12 &#8211; Loans 

Loan accounting framework 

The accounting for a loan depends on management&#8217;s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: 

&#8226; Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., &#8220;retained&#8221;) 

&#8226; Loans held-for-sale 

&#8226; Loans at fair value 

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets. 

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure requirements for FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan modifications prior to January 1, 2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. 

Loan portfolio 

The Firm&#8217;s loan portfolio, including loans of $ 149.8 billion associated with the First Republic acquisition, is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. 

Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale (c)(d) 

&#8226; Residential real estate (a) 

&#8226; Auto and other (b) 

&#8226; Credit card loans &#8226; Secured by real estate

(b) Includes scored auto, business banking loans and overdrafts in BWM and other consumer unsecured loans in CIB. 

(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. 

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower. 

(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 

(b) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. 

(c) Included $ 5.6 billion, $ 26.2 billion, $ 22.0 billion, $ 15.0 billion, $ 7.5 billion, and $ 12.9 billion of term loans originated in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and prior to 2019, respectively, and $ 2.5 billion of revolving loans within the revolving period associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

(d) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 

(e) Included $ 158 million of 30+ days past due loans associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

(f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated. 

Approximately 37 % of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (&#8220;Chapter 7 loans&#8221;) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2023, approximately 9 % of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due. 

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative. 

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 44 million and $ 45 million and $ 89 million and $ 90 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. 

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower&#8217;s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis. 

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management&#8217;s estimation of the borrower&#8217;s credit quality. 

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available. 

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at June 30, 2023. 

(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

(l) Included $ 4.3 billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $ 85.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion in equal to or greater than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively, within less than 80% LTV ratio associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

(m) Included $ 91.9 billion of loans associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

(n) Included $ 55.5 billion, $ 15.2 billion, $ 3.6 billion and $ 8.0 billion in California, New York, Florida and Massachusetts, respectively, associated with the First Republic acquisition. 

Loan modifications 

The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $ 35 million and $ 75 million, respectively. The financial effects of the FDMs, which were largely in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 15 years and 18 years, and reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate from 6.90 % to 4.21 % and 6.75 % to 4.01 % for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $ 33 million and $ 48 million of loans subject to a trial modification, and $ 3 million and $ 5 million of Chapter 7 loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. 

For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new TDRs were $ 115 million and $ 233 million, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on TDRs. 

Nature and extent of modifications

The dollar amount presented represents the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. 

Active and suspended foreclosure 

At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $ 566 million and $ 565 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

Loan modifications 

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card under long-term programs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose Commercial and industrial loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 438 million and $ 1.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties whose Other loans have been modified as FDMs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Secured by real estate FDMs were $ 77 million and $ 85 million respectively. The financial effects of FDMs were largely term extensions which extended the loans by a weighted-average of nine months . There were no re-defaults during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $ 1 million in modified term extensions that re-defaulted during the six months ended June 30, 2023. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new TDRs were $ 60 million and $ 479 million, respectively. New TDRs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the impact of these modifications were not material to the Firm. 

As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than those previously considered TDRs. 

Note 13 &#8211; Allowance for credit losses 

The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance as described in Note 1. 

The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the allowance for TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. 

The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to apply. 

This guidance was adopted under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587 million and an increase to retained earnings of $ 446 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card. 

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies.

(d) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably expected TDRs and modified PCD loans. 

(e) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

(f) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $ 18.4 billion and $ 13.7 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 881.5 billion and $ 774.0 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 19.3 billion and $ 29.1 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. Prior period amount for wholesale lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised to conform with the current presentation. 

Discussion of changes in the allowance 

The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2023 was $ 24.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $ 2.7 billion from December 31, 2022. 

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $ 1.5 billion, consisting of: 

&#8226; $ 819 million in wholesale , predominantly driven by net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions related to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and 

&#8226; $ 649 million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. 

The net addition also included $ 1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 

The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting an increased probability of a moderate recession due to tightening financial conditions. 

The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $ 587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further information. 

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.5% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The Firm&#8217;s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows: 

Assumptions at June 30, 2023 4Q23 2Q24 4Q24 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

4.2 % 4.9 % 5.0 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

0.5 % &#8212; % 1.0 % Assumptions at December 31, 2022 2Q23 4Q23 2Q24 U.S. unemployment rate (a) 

3.8 % 4.3 % 5.0 % YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) 

1.5 % 0.4 % &#8212; % 

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate. 

(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. 

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs 

Credit card securitizations 

As a result of the Firm&#8217;s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. 

Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts 

The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts. 

The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit 

risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm&#8217;s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm&#8217;s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.6 billion of investment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and noninvestment-grade retained interests were not material at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $ 5.9 billion and $ 5.8 billion of investment-grade retained interests at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 respectively, and $ 1.1 billion of noninvestment-grade retained interests at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

$ 3,412 &#160; $ 2,580 &#160; 

As of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs. 

Multi-seller conduits 

In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 12.4 billion and $ 13.8 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm&#8217;s investments reflect the Firm&#8217;s funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. 

Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 11.3 billion and $ 10.6 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 24 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 

Municipal bond vehicles 

Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (&#8220;TOB&#8221;) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. 

The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions.

(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, &#8220;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs&#8221;. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 1.1 billion and $ 2.1 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 

VIEs sponsored by third parties 

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm&#8217;s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. 

Tax credit vehicles 

The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing 

member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 32.4 billion and $ 30.2 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of which $ 12.6 billion and $ 10.6 billion was unfunded at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) 

The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. 

In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the 

power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 5.9 billion and $ 5.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 8.2 billion. 

Loan securitizations 

The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. 

Securitization activity 

The following table provides information related to the Firm&#8217;s securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored 

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to 

Ginnie Mae guidelines 

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share 

a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm&#8217;s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm&#8217;s sale of certain excess MSRs. 

The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans 

In addition to the Firm&#8217;s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 24, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government 

agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm&#8217;s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information. 

The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm&#8217;s Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.

Note 15 &#8211; Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights 

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights. 

Goodwill 

The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, represents estimated goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Frosch Travel Group, LLC in CCB and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB. 

(b) Predominantly foreign currency adjustments. 

Goodwill impairment testing 

Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s goodwill impairment testing. 

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm&#8217;s reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2023, or December 31, 2022, no r was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022. 

Mortgage servicing rights 

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs. 

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;SMBS&#8221;). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities. 

(c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. 

(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates. 

(e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm&#8217;s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements. 

The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments. 

(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices). 

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change. 

The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm&#8217;s MSRs at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

(b) Included long-term debt of $ 87.7 billion and $ 13.8 billion secured by assets totaling $ 221.2 billion and $ 208.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. 

(c) Included $ 78.6 billion and $ 72.3 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. 

(d) Included $ 11.2 billion and $ 10.3 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $ 45.7 billion and $ 45.3 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm&#8217;s next call date, if applicable. 

(e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included amounts accounted for at fair value which were not material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $ 18.5 billion and $ 10.5 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. 

(f) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value. 

(g) As of June 30, 2023, included $ 25.0 billion of FHLB advances associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note 28 for additional information. 

(h) As of June 30, 2023 , long-term debt in the aggregate of $ 191.7 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments. 

(i) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 is $ 41.9 billion, $ 58.5 billion, $ 38.0 billion, $ 29.2 billion and $ 75.2 billion, respectively. 

The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at fair value were 3.45 % and 3.26 % as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm&#8217;s interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.02 % and 4.89 % as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm&#8217;s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $ 34.5 billion and $ 28.2 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The Firm&#8217;s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm&#8217;s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 23 &#8211; Regulatory capital 

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. 

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized requirements, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm&#8217;s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators. 

The following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(a) Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 4.0 % as calculated under Method 2; plus a 4.0 % SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5 % capital conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0 % by the federal banking agencies. 

(b) For the period ended December 31, 2022, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to the Firm were 12.0 %, 13.5 % and 15.5 %, respectively; the Basel III Advanced CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio requirements applicable to the Firm were 10.5 %, 12.0 %, and 14.0 %, respectively.

CECL regulatory capital transition 

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9 billion CECL capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining $ 1.4 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. 

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm phased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. 

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions.

Note 24 &#8211; Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related 

financial instruments, guarantees, and other 

commitments 

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm&#8217;s view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm&#8217;s related accounting policies. 

To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. 

The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm&#8217;s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings. 

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 

The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives. 

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

(in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Notional amounts Derivative guarantees $ 56,900 &#160; $ 59,180 &#160; Stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives. 

Merchant charge-backs 

Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder&#8217;s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder&#8217;s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs. 

Loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications 

In connection with the Firm&#8217;s mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. 

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 26 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation. 

Sponsored member repo program 

The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (&#8220;FICC&#8221;) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC&#8217;s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients&#8217; respective obligations under the FICC&#8217;s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm&#8217;s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &#38; clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 185. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements. 

Guarantees of subsidiaries 

The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (&#8220;JPMFC&#8221;), a 100 %-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu with the Firm&#8217;s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 185 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Note 25 &#8211; Pledged assets and collateral 

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s pledged assets and collateral. 

Pledged assets 

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged.

Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s long-term debt. 

Collateral 

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. 

The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.

Note 26 &#8211; Litigation 

Contingencies 

As of June 30, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm&#8217;s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. 

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0 to approximately $ 1.3 billion at June 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm&#8217;s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: 

&#8226; the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, 

&#8226; the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, 

&#8226; the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 

&#8226; the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. 

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm&#8217;s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. 

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm&#8217;s material legal proceedings. 

1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (&#8220;1MDB&#8221;), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges &#8220;dishonest assistance&#8221; against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300 million and $ 500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court&#8217;s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, which the Court took under consideration. 

Amrapali . India&#8217;s Enforcement Directorate (&#8220;ED&#8221;) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (&#8220;Amrapali&#8221;). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers&#8217; petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India&#8217;s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (&#8220;PMLA&#8221;) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (&#8220;FEMA&#8221;). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. 

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (&#8220;FX&#8221;) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) 

through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. 

With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm&#8217;s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. The District Court denied certification of a putative class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. 

Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. 

The original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900 million to the approximately $ 5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court&#8217;s approval of the settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for rehearing of the Appellate Court&#8217;s approval. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700 million has been returned to the 

defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. 

Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 65 % of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. 

Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, was a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. In March 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s motions to dismiss these complaints, allowing some claims to proceed in both lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm&#8217;s former employee, James Edward Staley, into the two lawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant doctrine. In May 2023, the Court denied Staley&#8217;s motion to dismiss the impleader complaints. In June 2023, the Court granted the putative class&#8217; motion for class certification and granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will pay $ 290 million to a fund for Epstein survivors. The actions involving the government of the United States Virgin Islands and Staley are proceeding. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association&#8217;s (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation&#8217;s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;). The Swiss Competition Commission&#8217;s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. 

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm&#8217;s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. 

Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants have opposed. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle this action, subject to final documentation and court approval. 

Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers. 

Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm&#8217;s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which 

were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. 

A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm&#8217;s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm&#8217;s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. 

Two shareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June 2023, respectively, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to exercise adequate oversight with respect to the Firm&#8217;s provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These actions allege that the shareholders are excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. These actions were consolidated and defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. 

* * * 

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. 

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 

that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management&#8217;s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm&#8217;s legal expense was $ 420 million and $ 73 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm&#8217;s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. 

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s income for that period. 

Note 27 &#8211; Business segments 

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer &#38; Community Banking, Corporate &#38; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset &#38; Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm&#8217;s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s business segments. 

Segment results 

The following table provides a summary of the Firm&#8217;s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm&#8217;s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. 

Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm&#8217;s managed basis. 

Capital allocation 

The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated its line of business capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Note 28 &#8211; Business combinations 

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), as receiver, for $ 67.9 billion, resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7 billion recorded in other income. The estimated bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. The First Republic acquisition further advances the Firm's wealth management strategy and is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. 

The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair values required management to make certain market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. 

The Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the settlement process under which the purchase price, and the identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date. 

In addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending management's finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (such as loans and commitments, intangible assets and leases), which may take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. 

In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments (the "shared-loss assets"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement ("CSLA") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (&#8220;SFSLA&#8221;). The CSLA covers 80 % of credit losses, on a pari-passu basis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80 % of credit losses, on a pari-passu basis, for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence. The indemnification assets which represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA are reflected in the total assets acquired. 

As part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a five-year , $ 50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4 % and is secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the FDIC. 

The Firm had placed a $ 5 billion deposit with First Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30 billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $ 5 billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $ 25 billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023. 

The computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are presented below.

(a) Includes $ 10.6 billion of cash paid to the FDIC at acquisition and $ 3.7 billion payable to the FDIC, less cash acquired of $ 680 million. 

(b) Includes $ 447 million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date. 

(c) Other assets include $ 1.2 billion in tax-oriented investments and $ 756 million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented investment liabilities of $ 669 million and lease liabilities of $ 756 million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 17 for additional information. 

The issuance of the $ 50 billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $ 5 billion deposit and $ 447 million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $ 3.7 billion payable to the FDIC as part of the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions. 

The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. 

Refer to JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s accounting policies and valuation methodologies for securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments. 

Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles 

Core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic transaction. The core deposit intangible of $ 1.3 billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available to market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $ 187 million were valued by discounting estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well 

as related costs to service the relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying values of the core deposit and customer relationship intangibles were $ 1.2 billion and $ 183 million, respectively, reflecting accumulated amortization of approximately $ 30 million and $ 4 million, respectively. 

Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements 

The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over the respective shared loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. 

The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets will be based on changes in amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared loss assets and will be recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration. 

Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances 

The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. 

The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair value of the FHLB advances was based on a discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates. 

Loans 

The following table presents the unpaid principal balance and estimated fair value of the loans acquired as of May 1, 2023.

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 

Included in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net income contributed by First Republic since the acquisition date of May 1, 2023 of $ 3.1 billion, $ 897 million and $ 2.4 billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7 billion and the provision for credit losses of $ 1.2 billion. Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets and loans. 

The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods, particularly in light of recent changes in market and economic conditions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.: 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of June 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and changes in stockholders&#8217; equity for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,2023 and 2022 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;interim financial statements&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 21, 2023, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 

These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm&#8217;s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).

Mortgage product types : 

Alt-A 

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm&#8217;s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. 

Option ARMs 

The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 

accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers. 

Prime 

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories. 

Subprime 

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower&#8217;s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.

In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance: 

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund&#8217;s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura &#8220;star rating&#8221; is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer 

categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a &#8220;primary share class&#8221; level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a &#8220;primary share class&#8221; level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 

&#8220; Primary share class &#8221; means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.
