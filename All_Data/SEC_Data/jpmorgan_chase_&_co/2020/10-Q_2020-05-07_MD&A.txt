Form 10-Q for additional information on these measures.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the first 
quarter of 2020 versus the first quarter of 2019, unless 
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $2.9 billion for the 
first quarter of 2020, or $0.78 per share, on net revenue of 
$28.3 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 4% and ROTCE of 
5%. The Firm recorded a number of significant items in the 
first quarter of 2020, including an addition to the allowance 
for credit losses of $6.8 billion, a $951 million loss in Credit 
Adjustments & Other in CIB predominantly driven by funding 
spread widening on derivatives, and $896 million of 
markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded 
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and CB.

•  Net income was down 69%, predominantly driven by an 
increase in the provision for credit losses across the Firm 
reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic and continued pressure on oil prices.

•  Total net revenue decreased 3%. Net interest income was 
$14.4 billion, flat versus the prior year, with the impact of 
lower rates offset by balance sheet growth and mix, as 

5

well as higher net interest income in CIB Markets. 
Noninterest revenue was $13.8 billion, down 6%. The 
reduction in revenue included a $951 million loss in Credit 
Adjustments & Other in CIB predominantly driven by 
funding spread widening on derivatives and $896 million 
of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including 
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio 
in CIB and CB; these items were partially offset by higher 
CIB Markets noninterest revenue. 

•  Noninterest expense was $16.9 billion, up 3%, driven by 

higher volume- and revenue-related expense and 
investments, as well as higher legal expense, partially 
offset by lower structural expense. 

•  The provision for credit losses was $8.3 billion, up $6.8 
billion from the prior year driven by the additions to the 
allowance for credit losses. 

•  The total allowance for credit losses was $25.4 billion at 
March 31, 2020, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage 
ratio of 2.32%, compared with 1.43% in the prior year, 
driven by the additions to allowance for credit losses and 
the adoption of CECL. The Firm’s nonperforming assets 
totaled $6.4 billion at March 31, 2020, an increase from 
$5.6 billion in the prior year, driven by the inclusion of 
purchased credit deteriorated loans in the mortgage 
portfolio, which are subject to nonaccrual loan treatment 
following the adoption of CECL.  

•  Firmwide end-of-period (“EOP”) loans of $1.0 trillion were 

up 6% driven by drawdowns on committed revolving 
credit facilities in March within the wholesale LOBs. 
Excluding the impact of certain loan sales in Home 
Lending, EOP loans would have been up 9%. Firmwide 
average loans were $963 billion, down 1%. Excluding the 
impact of certain loan sales in Home Lending, average 
loans would have been up 3%.

•  On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended share 
repurchases through the second quarter of 2020.

Selected capital-related metrics
•  The Firm’s CET1 capital was $184 billion, and the 

Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 11.5% and 
12.3%, respectively.

•  The Firm’s SLR was 6.0%.

•  The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the first quarter of 2020 at 

$60.71, up 5% versus the prior year.

ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19–20 for a further 
discussion of each of these measures.

2020 outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, 
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 79 and Risk Factors on 
page 180 of this Form 10-Q and pages 6–28 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of 
those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could 
cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially 
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no 
assurance that actual results in the full year of 2020 will be in 
line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not 
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of 
2020 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global 
and U.S. economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial 
markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the 
competitive environment, client and customer activity 
levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the 
U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each 
of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and 
its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate 
adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to 
ongoing developments in the business, economic, 
regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. The 
outlook information contained in the 2019 Form 10-K, in the 
Firm’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 25, 2020, 
containing copies of the slides furnished at the Firm’s 2020 
Investor Day, and in the Firm’s Current Reports on Form 8-K 
dated April 14, 2020, to review 2020 first quarter earnings, 
is superseded by the information contained in this
Form 10-Q. 

Firmwide
•  Management expects second quarter 2020 net interest 
income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $14 
billion, market dependent. For the full-year 2020, 
management expects net interest income, on a managed 
basis, to be approximately $56 billion, market 
dependent.

•  Management expects adjusted expense for the full-year 

2020 to be below $65 billion.

•  Management expects additions to the allowance for credit 
losses in the second quarter of 2020. Depending on the 
extent of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, 
the additions to the Firm’s allowance for credit losses 
could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next 
several quarters versus the additions in the first quarter 
of 2020.

Business Developments
COVID-19 Pandemic
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm 
established a corporate crisis team (“CCT”) along with crisis 
response teams that are connected across countries, 
regions and globally. The CCT includes representation from 
each LOB and critical functions including Human Resources, 
Risk and Compliance, Legal, Security and Technology, and it 
engages directly with the Firm’s Operating Committee on a 
frequent basis. The CCT provides a central point for the 
gathering of data which allows for rapid identification and 
prioritization of issues. The CCT also monitors key 
operational metrics, risks and concerns on an ongoing basis.  

The Firm invoked resiliency plans to allow its businesses to 
remain operational, utilizing disaster recovery sites and 
implementing alternative work arrangements globally. The 
Firm now has more than 180,000 employees globally 
working from home from every LOB and corporate function, 
including traders, bankers, portfolio managers, operations, 
finance, risk and compliance, legal and call center teams 
globally. The Firm is monitoring the status of work-from-
home arrangements and has been updating relevant local 
authorities as appropriate. Management continues to 
monitor key operational metrics as well as thematic cross-
business risks and concerns.

In addition, the Firm implemented strategies and 
procedures designed to help it respond to increased market 
volatility, client demand for credit and liquidity, distress in 
certain industries/sectors and the ongoing impacts to 
consumers and small businesses.  

Supporting clients and customers
The Firm has continued to support its clients and customers 
as they navigate the challenging conditions caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic by providing liquidity and advice. In 
March 2020, the Firm extended more than $100 billion of 
new and renewed credit to its clients and customers.

•  In the wholesale businesses, clients drew more than $50 
billion on their committed revolving credit facilities, and 
the Firm approved over $25 billion of new credit 
extensions for clients most impacted by the COVID-19 
pandemic, during the first quarter

provide a wide range of banking services accessible to 
customers online.

Protecting and supporting employees
In addition to widespread work-from-home arrangements, 
the Firm has taken further actions to protect and support 
its employees including;

•  For employees with jobs that can only be performed on-

site, modified business operations, implemented 
staggered shifts, changed seating arrangements, closed 
buildings to nonessential visitors and intensified and 
increased frequency of cleaning of all offices and 
branches worldwide 

•  Ensured that all branch employees are being paid for 

their regularly scheduled hours even if those hours are 
reduced or their branch is temporarily closed

•  Continued to pay employees who are at home due to 
potential exposure to the virus or whose health is at 
higher risk as well as provided paid medical leave to 
affected employees 

•  Deployed clinical staff internally to support employees 
•  Granted a special payment of up to $1,000 to full- and 

part-time employees whose jobs require them to continue 
working on-site and whose annual cash compensation is 
less than $60,000

•  Provided all employees with up to five additional paid 
days off to manage personal needs, which may include 
dependent care, child care or other issues, as well as 
offering free COVID-19 related medical treatment for all 
of the Firm’s U.S. employees and their dependents.

Giving to communities
The Firm has taken steps to help address immediate 
humanitarian needs and long-term economic challenges 
posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the communities in 
which it operates. To help the most vulnerable and hardest 
hit communities, the Firm has announced a $150 million 
loan program to deploy capital to underserved small 
businesses and nonprofits, as well as a $50 million 
philanthropic commitment. An initial $15 million 
commitment is intended to:

•  Provide immediate healthcare, food and other 

•  In the consumer businesses, the Firm extended 

humanitarian relief globally

approximately $20 billion in new credit across Home 
Lending, Credit Card and Auto.

The Firm is actively participating in the Small Business 
Association’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) 
and as of May 4th the Firm has funded approximately $29 
billion under the program.

For customers that are experiencing financial hardships as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm developed a 
payment assistance program to allow mortgage, auto and 
card customers to delay payments for three months, as well 
as waiving or refunding certain fees.

Three-quarters of the Firm’s branch network continues to 
operate, ATMs remain accessible and the Firm continues to 

•  Help existing nonprofit partners around the world that 
are responding in their communities to the COVID-19 
pandemic

•  Assist small businesses that are vulnerable to economic 

hardships.

Regulatory actions and programs
Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic on pages 10-11 for information concerning 
relevant regulatory actions and the significant financing 
programs in which the Firm is participating in order to 
support its customers and clients.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Firm’s results 
and operations are discussed throughout this document.

Departure of the U.K. from the EU
The Firm continues to execute on its Firmwide Brexit 
Implementation program and remains focused on the 
following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its 
EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client 
readiness; and business and operational readiness. 
However, the COVID-19 pandemic has added incremental 
risk to the program due to the potential impact on 
execution of changes such as relocation of employees given 
travel restrictions, or the ability of clients to be 
operationally ready to the extent that they have diverted 
resources to address the effects of the pandemic. It has also 
slowed down the political process to finalize the legal and 
regulatory framework that will be in place after the 
transition period that is scheduled to expire on December 
31, 2020, thus lengthening the period of planning 
uncertainty.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update 
providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying 
generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and 
hedge relationships affected by benchmark reform. The 
Firm expects to apply certain of the practical expedients 
and is evaluating the timing and application of those 
elections. Refer to Accounting and Reporting Developments 
on page 78 for additional information. The Firm continues 
to monitor the transition relief being considered by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and U.S. 
Treasury Department regarding accounting and tax 
implications of reference rate reform. 

The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans to 
appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR 
discontinuation. Refer to Business Developments on page 
47 of the 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s 
initiatives to address the expected discontinuation of the 
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

Regulatory Developments Relating to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic

Beginning in March 2020, the U.S. government as well as 
central banks around the world have taken a series of 
actions to help individuals, households and businesses that 
have been adversely affected by the economic disruption 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which was 
signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides, among other 
things, funding to support loan facilities to assist consumers 
and businesses. Set forth below is a summary as of the date 
of this Form 10-Q of U.S. government actions currently 
impacting the Firm and U.S. government programs in which 
the Firm is participating to support individuals, businesses, 
and the broader economy. The Firm will continue to assess 
ongoing developments in government actions in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. government actions

Eligible retained income definition. On March 17, 2020, the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal 
Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(“FDIC”), collectively the “federal banking agencies,” issued 
an interim final rule that revised the definition of “eligible 
retained income” in the regulatory capital rules that apply 
to all U.S. banking organizations. On March 23, 2020, the 
Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that revised the 
definition of “eligible retained income” for purposes of the 
total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) buffer requirements 
that apply to global systemically important banking 
organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained 
income makes any automatic limitations on payout 
distributions that could apply under the agencies’ capital 
rules or TLAC rule take effect on a more graduated basis in 
the event that a banking organization’s capital, leverage and 
TLAC ratios were to decline below regulatory requirements 
(including buffers). The March 17 interim final rule was 
issued, in conjunction with an interagency statement 
encouraging banking organizations to use their capital and 
liquidity buffers, to further support banking organizations’ 
abilities to lend to households and businesses affected by 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reserve requirements. On March 26, 2020, the Federal 
Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero 
percent, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for 
all depository institutions, an action that frees up liquidity 
in the banking system to support lending to households and 
businesses. 

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and 
Note 21 for additional information on the reduction to the 
reserve requirement.

Regulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) 
transition delay. On March 31, 2020, the federal banking 
agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the 
option to temporarily delay the effects of CECL on 

10

regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year 
transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). The 
Firm elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44 and Note 
22 on pages 159-160 for additional information on the 
CECL capital transition provisions and the impact to the 
Firm’s capital measures.

Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary revision. On 
April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final 
rule that revises, on a temporary basis, the calculation of 
total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance 
sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at 
Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions will allow the Firm 
to continue to support U.S. Treasury markets and to serve 
as financial intermediaries for households and businesses. 
This exclusion is effective April 1, 2020, and will remain in 
effect through March 31, 2021.   

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44 for 
additional information on the Firm’s SLR.

Loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking 
agencies along with the National Credit Union 
Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, in consultation with the state financial regulators, 
issued an interagency statement revising a March 22, 2020 
interagency statement on loan modifications and the 
reporting for financial institutions working with customers 
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). 
The IA Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with 
borrowers where the loans are prudently underwritten, and 
not considered past due or carried on nonaccrual status, 
should not result in the loans automatically being 
considered modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(“TDR”) for accounting and financial reporting purposes, or 
for purposes of their respective risk-based capital rules, 
which would otherwise require financial institutions subject 
to the capital rules to hold more capital. The IA Statement 
also clarifies the interaction between its previous guidance 
and Section 4013 of the CARES Act, which provides certain 
financial institutions the option to suspend the application 
of accounting guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time 
for loan modifications made to address the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The special considerations addressed 
in the IA Statement and Section 4013 of the CARES Act, if 
applied, would have had no impact on the accounting for 
the Firm’s modification activities in the three months ended 
March 31, 2020 but may be relevant for modifications 
offered in the future.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 50-51 and Note 12 for 
additional information on the Firm’s loan modification 
activities.

U.S. government facilities and programs. Beginning in March 
2020, the Federal Reserve announced a suite of facilities 
using its emergency lending powers under section 13(3) of 

the Federal Reserve Act to support the flow of credit to 
individuals, households and businesses adversely affected 
by the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the broader 
economy. These facilities include the Money Market Mutual 
Fund Liquidity Facility (“MMLF”), Primary Dealer Credit 
Facility (“PDCF”) and Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
(“CPFF”). The Firm is currently participating in the MMLF 
and PDCF to support the broader economy by providing 
liquidity to money market mutual funds and supporting the 
functioning of the secured financing market, respectively. 
Under the CPFF, the Firm is acting as a dealer to purchase 
eligible commercial paper. In addition, beginning April 3, 
2020, the PPP, established by the CARES Act and 
administered by the SBA, authorized eligible lenders to 
provide nonrecourse loans to small businesses to provide an 
incentive for these businesses to keep their workers on their 
payroll. The Firm is currently participating in the PPP to 
support its small business clients.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44, 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and Note 22 for 
additional information of the Firm’s participation in the 
MMLF. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 
for additional information of the Firm’s participation in the 
PDCF. Refer to Business Developments on pages 8-9 for 
additional information on the Firm’s participation in the 
PPP.

(a)  In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from 

asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and 
deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts were revised to conform 
with the current presentation.

(b)  Included operating lease income of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the 

three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB,  
reflecting:

•  higher debt underwriting fees driven by both increased 
industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in investment-
grade bonds, particularly in March, as clients sought to 
access liquidity,

•  higher equity underwriting fees driven by increased 
industry-wide fees primarily in the IPO market, with 
strong activity in January and February, compared to a 
weak prior year,

largely offset by

•  lower advisory fees compared to a strong prior year, 

driven by a lower number of completed transactions, as 
well as the impact of delays in regulatory approvals.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 26–30 and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased reflecting two 
significant items: 

•  a $951 million loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & Other 
predominantly driven by funding spread widening on 
derivatives, and 

•  $896 million of markdowns on held-for-sale positions, 

including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing 
portfolio in CIB and CB, as high-yield spreads widened 
significantly.

12

Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue 
increased driven by Fixed Income Markets on strong client 
activity, primarily in Rates and Currencies & Emerging 
Markets, as a result of higher trading volume, and in Equity 
Markets on strong client activity in derivatives, particularly 
in March for both businesses.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business 
performance on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 
26–30, pages 34–36 and page 37, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily due 
to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in 
customer accounts and transactions, and in CIB and CB from 
an increase in cash management transactions.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25, CIB on pages 
26–30 and CB on pages 31–33, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by:

•  higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on higher 

client-driven volume particularly in March, and 

•  higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB as a 

result of higher asset values at the beginning of 2020, 
driven by higher average market levels and strong net 
inflows into long-term products over the past year, 
despite the impact of market volatility in March. 

Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 23–
25, pages 26–30 and pages 34–36 , respectively, and Note 
6 for additional information.
Investment securities gains in both periods reflected the 
impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio.  
Refer to Corporate segment results on page 37 and Note 10 
for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

•  lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting faster 
prepayment speeds on lower rates and a lower level of 
third-party loans serviced, as well as lower MSR risk 
management results,

largely offset by

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 
production volumes and margins, and the absence of a 
gain on a loan sale in the prior year.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25, Note 6 and 
15 for further information.

Card income decreased driven by lower net interchange 
income reflecting higher rewards costs and partner 
payments, partially offset by higher card sales volume, 
despite a decline in March.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 23–25 and Note 6 
for further information.

Other income decreased reflecting:

•  losses on certain equity investments in CIB 

•  net valuation losses on certain investments in AWM, 

compared with gains in the prior year 

•  higher amortization on a higher level of alternative 

energy investments in CIB. The increased amortization is 
more than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits.

largely offset by

•  higher operating lease income from growth in auto 

operating lease volume in CCB

Refer to Note 6 for further information.

Net interest income was flat as the impact of lower rates 
was offset by balance sheet growth and mix, as well as 
higher CIB Markets net interest income.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.5 
trillion, up $167 billion, and the yield was 3.14%, down 66 
bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 
2.37%, a decrease of 20 bps. The net yield excluding CIB 
Markets was 3.01%, down 42bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial 
measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, 
interest and rates schedule on page 170 for further details; 
and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19–20 for a further

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. 
In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated 
loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding 
credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align 
with the methodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period 
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. 
Refer to Note 1 for further information.

The provision for credit losses increased driven by 
additions to both the consumer and wholesale allowance for 
credit losses.
The increase in total consumer was driven by:

•  additions of $4.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses,  

reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, consisting of $3.8 billion for Card, $300 
million for Home Lending, $235 million for Auto, and $80 
million for CBB;

•  net charge-offs were flat reflecting higher net charge-offs 
in Card on loan growth, in line with prior expectations, 
offset by higher recoveries in Home Lending on a current 
period loan sale.

The increase in wholesale reflects a net addition of $2.4 
billion to the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs. 
The net addition was predominantly driven by the 
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a result 
of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple 
sectors, and continued pressure on oil prices, with the 
largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, and Consumer 
& Retail industries.

Compensation expense was flat as efficiencies in several 
businesses and lower compensation expense in CIB was 
offset by investments in new hires.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

•  higher legal expense in CIB and Corporate

•  higher volume-related expense, including depreciation 
from growth in auto lease assets in CCB, and brokerage 
expense in CIB

•  higher investments across the businesses, including 

technology,

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of significant deposit inflows, 
which also funded asset growth across the Firm. Deposits 
with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash 
with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve 
Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements was flat as the reduction in the deployment of 
cash in Treasury and CIO was offset by an increase in client-
driven market-making activities and higher collateral 
requirements as a result of changes in market conditions in 
March, as well as higher demand for securities to cover 
short positions when compared with lower levels at year-
end in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
45–49 and Note 11 for additional information.

Trading assets increased, reflecting growth in client-driven 
market-making activities in CIB, predominantly debt 
instruments in Fixed Income Markets and when compared 
with lower levels at year-end, as well as higher derivative 
receivables in CIB as a result of market movements, 
including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities increased, reflecting:
•  in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio, net purchases 

of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. 
Treasuries driven by interest rate risk management 
activities, partially offset by a non-cash transfer of $26.1 
billion of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS from the 
AFS to the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio, resulting in 
a comparable increase in HTM.

Refer to Corporate segment results on page 37, Investment

for additional information on Investment securities.

Loans increased predominantly reflecting drawdowns on 
committed revolving credit facilities in March in CIB, CB and 
AWM, partially offset by a reduction in Card due to 
seasonality and a decline in sales volume in March as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The allowance for loan losses increased driven by:

•  additions of $5.9 billion, consisting of 

–  $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in Credit Card, 

reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, and 

–  a net $1.6 billion in wholesale, primarily reflecting the 
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a 
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across 
multiple sectors, and continued pressure on oil prices, 
with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, 
and Consumer & Retail industries, and 

•  a net $4.2 billion addition as a result of the adoption of 

CECL. 

There were also additions to the allowance for lending-
related commitments, which is included in other liabilities 
on the consolidated balance sheets, of $858 million related 
to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued 
pressure on oil prices, and $98 million related to the 
adoption of CECL, resulting in total additions to the allowance 
for credit losses of $6.8 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, 
as of March 31, 2020.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
50–66, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased 
predominantly driven by higher client receivables in CIB 
during a period of heightened market volatility.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles decreased reflecting 
lower MSRs as a result of faster prepayment speeds on lower 
rates and the realization of expected cash flows, partially 
offset by net additions to the MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for 
additional information.

Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued)

Other assets increased reflecting higher cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties during a period of 
heightened market volatility, and the Firm’s participation in 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s (“FRBB”) MMLF. The 
assets purchased from money market mutual fund clients 
related to the MMLF were funded by nonrecourse advances 
from the FRBB, which are recorded in short-term 
borrowings. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to 
the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 10-11 and Liquidity Risk

Deposits increased driven by significant inflows in CIB, CB 
and AWM as clients focused on increasing their cash 
balances as a result of changes in market conditions driven 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Deposits also increased in CCB 
due to seasonal growth in existing and new accounts.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 and 
Notes 2 and 16 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased from client-driven 
market-making activities as a result of changes in market 
conditions in March and higher financing of trading assets-
debt instruments when compared with lower levels at year-
end in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–
49 and Note 11 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased driven by the Firm’s 
participation in the FRBB’s MMLF. The nonrecourse advances 
from the FRBB funded the assets purchased from money 
market mutual fund clients related to the MMLF, which are 
recorded in other assets. Refer to Regulatory Developments 
Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 10-11 and 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for additional 
information.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven market-
making activities in CIB, which resulted in higher levels of 
short positions in both debt and equity instruments in 
Markets, as well as higher derivative payables as a result of 
market movements, including the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting 
higher client payables related to client-driven activities in 
CIB during a period of heightened market volatility.

16

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased 
due to higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller 
conduit commercial paper issued to third parties, partially 
offset by activity in municipal bond vehicles.

Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 18 and 
Notes 14 and 23 for further information on Firm-sponsored 
VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased as a result of

•  higher FHLB advances and an increase in senior debt 

reflecting fair value hedge accounting adjustments related 
to lower interest rates, partially offset by net maturities in 
Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by
•  a decrease in the fair value of structured notes in CIB 

related to market movements in March.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–49 for 
additional information on the Firm’s long-term debt 
activities.
Stockholders’ equity was flat reflecting the net impact of 
capital actions, net income, the adoption of CECL and an 
increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The increase in AOCI was driven by higher 
valuation of interest rate cash flow hedges, debit valuation 
adjustment on fair value option-elected liabilities, and net 
unrealized gains on AFS securities. Refer to page 83 for 
information on changes in stockholders’ equity and Capital 
actions on pages 42–43.

Operating activities
•  In 2020, cash used primarily resulted from higher trading 
assets, other assets and accrued interest and accounts 
receivable, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and 
accounts payable and other liabilities.

•  In 2019, cash used primarily resulted from higher trading 

assets-debt and equity instruments and securities 
borrowed, partially offset by increased trading liabilities 
and accounts payable and other liabilities, and net 
proceeds from loans held-for-sale.

Investing activities
•  In 2020, cash used primarily resulted from net purchases 

of investment securities, net loan originations and 
purchases of assets from money market mutual fund 
clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided by the 
FRBB under the MMLF.

•  In 2019, cash provided resulted from a decrease in 

securities purchased under resale agreements, and net 
proceeds from sales of loans held-for-investment.

Financing activities
•  In 2020, cash provided resulted from higher deposits,  
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements, and net proceeds from 
long- and short-term borrowings, which included the non-
recourse advances provided by the FRBB.   

•  In 2019, cash provided resulted from higher securities 

loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and higher 
deposits.

•  For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock. On March 15, 2020, in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended 
share repurchases through the second quarter of 2020.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet 
arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 80–84.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
level. These non-GAAP measures include:

•  Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis)

•  Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less noninterest expense

•  Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets 

businesses

•  Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS

•  Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance 
Measures on pages 57–59 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19–20 for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods.

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue and expense are generally 
recognized in the segment responsible for the related 
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) 
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.

Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer 
to Line of business equity on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2019 Form 10-K for additional information on business 
segment capital allocation. 

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

Business segment changes
In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a 
Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a 
realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. 
The Wholesale Payments business comprises:

•  Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB
•  Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance 

was previously reported in Lending in CIB.

In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, 
the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the 
Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, 
and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services 
business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily 
on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to 
reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned 
from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The 
prior-period amounts were revised to conform with the current 
presentation, including a decrease to period-end assets and headcount of 
$13.4 billion and 4,114, respectively, as of March 31, 2019.

Quarterly results
Net income was $191 million, a decrease of 95%, 
predominantly driven by an increase in the provision for 
credit losses.

Net revenue was $13.2 billion, a decrease of 2%. 

Net interest income was $9.2 billion, down 3%, driven by:

•  the impact of deposit margin compression, partially 
offset by growth in deposit balances in CBB, and

•  lower loan balances in Home Lending predominantly due 

to prior year loan sales,

largely offset by

•  higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card.

Noninterest revenue was $4.0 billion, down 2%, driven by:

•  lower card income due to lower net interchange income 
reflecting higher rewards costs and partner payments, 
partially offset by higher card sales volume, despite a 
decline in March, and

•  lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting faster 
prepayment speeds on lower rates and a lower level of 
third-party loans serviced, as well as lower MSR risk 
management results,

predominantly offset by 

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 
production volumes and margins, and the absence of a 
gain on a loan sale in the prior year, 

•  higher auto lease volume, and

•  higher deposit-related fees.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage 
fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 3%, driven by:

•  higher volume- and revenue-related expense, including 

depreciation on auto lease assets, and investments in the 
business, 

partially offset by

•  lower structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was $5.8 billion, an increase 
of $4.5 billion, driven by additions to the allowance for 
credit losses reflecting deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, consisting of:
•  $3.8 billion for Card, $300 million for Home Lending, 

$250 million for Auto and $159 million in CBB

•  net charge-offs were flat reflecting higher net charge-offs 
in Card on loan growth, in line with prior expectations, 
offset by higher recoveries in Home Lending on a current 
period loan sale.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting 
guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI 
loans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans 
under CECL. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a)  At March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $970 million of PCD 
loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI 
loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans 
as each of the pools was performing.

(b)  At March 31, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage 
loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government 
agencies of $616 million and $2.2 billion, respectively. These amounts 
have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(c)  At March 31, 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates included PCD loans. 
The rate prior to January 1, 2020 was revised to include the impact of 
PCI loans. 

(d)  At March 31, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans insured by 

U.S. government agencies of $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, 
that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded 
based upon the government guarantee.

•  Lending revenue was $350 million, up 36%, 

predominantly driven by fair value gains on hedges of 
accrual loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.4 billion, up 
11%. Markets revenue was $7.2 billion, up 32%.
•  Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.0 billion, up 34%, 
driven by strong client activity across products primarily 
in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets reflecting 
higher trading volume particularly in March.

•  Equity Markets revenue was $2.2 billion, up 28%, driven 
by strong client activity in derivatives and higher revenue 
in Cash Equities, particularly in March.

•  Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6%, 

predominantly driven by deposit balance and fee growth 
partially offset by deposit margin compression.

•  Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $951 million, 
predominantly driven by funding spread widening on 
derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $5.9 billion, up 5%, driven by 
higher legal expense, volume- and revenue-related 
expenses and investments in the business, partially offset 
by lower structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, compared 
with $87 million in the prior year. The increase was 
predominantly driven by additions to the allowance for 
credit losses from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
across multiple sectors and continued pressure on oil 
prices, with the largest impact in the Oil & Gas and 
Consumer & Retail industries.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned 
from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The 
prior-period amounts were revised to conform with the current 
presentation.

(a)  Includes credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed centrally 

within CIB and funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives 
and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, which 
are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are 
presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA 
amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. 

Quarterly results
Net income was $2.0 billion, down 39%, predominantly 
driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $9.9 billion, down 1%.

Banking revenue was $2.6 billion, down 24%.
•  Investment Banking revenue was $886 million, down 

49%, predominantly driven by $820 million of 
markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded 
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio as high-
yield spreads widened significantly. The decline was 
partially offset by higher Investment Banking fees, up 
3%. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global 
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
–  Debt underwriting fees were $1.1 billion, up 15%, 

driven by both increased industry-wide fees and wallet 
share gains in investment-grade bonds, particularly in 
March as clients sought to access liquidity.

–  Equity underwriting fees were $331 million, up 25%,  
driven by increased industry-wide fees primarily in the 
IPO market, with strong activity in January and 
February, compared to a weak prior year.

–  Advisory fees were $503 million, down 22%, compared 

to a strong prior year, driven by a lower number of 
completed transactions as well as the impact of delays 
in regulatory approvals.

•  Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.4 billion, down 4%, 

driven by a reporting re-classification for certain 
expenses which are now reported as contra revenue in 
Merchant Services. In addition, deposit margin

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 
and 7 for a description of the composition of these income 
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 69 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further 
information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

In the first quarter of 2020, CIB Markets had two loss days. Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income 
Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine 
backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk (“VaR”) measure and exclude 
select components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting 
gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 67–69.

Quarterly results
Net income was $147 million, a decrease of 86%, 
predominantly driven by an increase in the provision for 
credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.2 billion, down 10%. Net interest 
income was $1.6 billion, down 7%, driven by lower deposit 
margins, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 
Noninterest revenue was $621 million, a decrease of 15%, 
driven by markdowns on held-for-sale positions, including 
unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio, 
and lower investment banking revenue, partially offset by 
higher deposit-related fees.

Noninterest expense was $988 million, up 5%, 
predominantly driven by investments in the business. 

The provision for credit losses was $1.0 billion, compared 
with $90 million in the prior year. The increase was 
predominantly driven by additions to the allowance for 
credit losses from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
across multiple sectors and continued pressure on oil 
prices, with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, 
and Consumer & Retail industries.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses. 

CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which 
are primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral 
includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or 
other assets. Products include term loans, revolving lines of 
credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and 
standby letters of credit.

Wholesale payments includes revenue from a broad range 
of products and services that enable CB clients to manage 
payments and receipts, as well as invest and manage funds.

Investment banking includes revenue from a range of 
products providing CB clients with sophisticated capital-
raising alternatives, as well as balance sheet and risk 
management tools through advisory, equity underwriting, 
and loan syndications. Revenue from Fixed Income and 
Equity Markets products used by CB clients is also included. 

Other product revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent 
adjustments generated from Community Development 
Banking activities and certain income derived from principal 
transactions.

COMMERCIAL BANKING

Commercial Banking provides comprehensive financial 
solutions, including lending, wholesale payments, 
investment banking and asset management products 
across three primary client segments: Middle Market 
Banking, Corporate Client Banking and Commercial 
Real Estate Banking. Other includes amounts not 
aligned with a primary client segment. 

Middle Market Banking covers small business and 
midsized corporations, local governments and 
nonprofit clients.

Corporate Client Banking covers large corporations. 

Commercial Real Estate Banking covers investors, 
developers, and owners of multifamily, office, retail, 
industrial and affordable housing properties.

Quarterly results
Net income was $664 million, flat versus the prior year.

Net revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3%. Net interest income 
of $897 million was flat, reflecting deposit and loan growth, 
offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue 
was $2.7 billion, up 4%, largely driven by: 

•  higher asset management fees as a result of higher asset 
values at the beginning of 2020 driven by higher average 
market levels, and strong net inflows into long-term 
products over the past year despite the impact of market 
volatility in March, and 

•  increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven 

volume particularly in March,

largely offset by 

•  net valuation losses on certain investments, compared 

with gains in the prior year.

Revenue from Asset Management was $1.7 billion, down 
1%, driven by:

•  net valuation losses on certain investments, compared 

with gains in the prior year, 

largely offset by 

•  higher asset management fees as a result of higher 
average market levels, despite the impact of market 
volatility in March. 

Revenue from Wealth Management was $1.9 billion, up 8%, 
predominantly driven by:

•  increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven 

volume particularly in March,

•  deposit and loan growth, and 

•  higher asset management fees as a result of higher 

average market levels and strong net inflows into long-
term products over the past year, despite the impact of 
market volatility in March, 

partially offset by

•  deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense of $2.7 billion was flat, as higher 
investments and volume-and revenue-related expense, were 
predominantly offset by lower structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was $94 million, driven by 
additions to the allowance for credit losses from the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as loan growth.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
50–66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 64–65 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

(a)  At March 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities

(b)  During the first quarter of 2020, the Firm transferred $26.1 billion of 
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS from AFS to HTM for capital 
management purposes.

Refer to Note 10 for further information.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $125 million compared with net income of 
$251 million in the prior year. 

Net revenue was $166 million, compared with $425 million 
in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net 
interest income on lower rates, largely offset by higher 
noninterest revenue primarily due to higher net investment 
securities gains reflecting the impact of repositioning the 
investment securities portfolio, and market-driven impacts 
on certain Corporate investments.

Noninterest expense of $146 million was down $65 million 
due to lower structural expense, largely offset by a lower 
net legal benefit compared to the prior year.

The current period income tax expense was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes and more 
specifically, the impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year 
expected tax rate relative to the level of pretax income for 
the quarter.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 

•  Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 

escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; 

•  Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

•  Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to 
enhance controls, ongoing employee training and 
development, talent retention, and other measures. The 
Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K 
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.

38

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 

Refer to pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K, Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm remains well-capitalized, but has been impacted 
by recent market events as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The continuation or further deterioration of the 
current macroeconomic environment could result in 
additional impacts to the Firms capital and leverage 
position. 

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies (“BHC”) 
and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository 
institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, 
weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based 
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated 
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced 
approaches. 

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios.  

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach 
banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the 
SLR. Refer to SLR on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
Current Expected Credit Losses. As disclosed in the Firm’s 
2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the 
January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to 
retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% 
per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response 
to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 
2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final 
rule that provided the option to temporarily delay the 
effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed 
by a three-year transition period (“CECL capital transition 
provisions”).

The interim final rule provides a uniform approach for 
estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy 
incurred loss model during the first two years of the 
transition period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby 
the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of the change 
in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on 
PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at 
December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 
capital as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be 
phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning 
January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL 
capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period 
ended March 31, 2020, the capital measures of the Firm 
exclude $4.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact 
to retained earnings and 25% of the $6.8 billion increase in 
the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on 
PCD loans). 

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions on Tier 
2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage 
exposure have also been incorporated into the Firm’s 
capital measures. Refer to Note 1 for further information on 
the CECL accounting guidance. 

39

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. On March 18, 
2020, the Federal Reserve established a facility, authorized 
through September 30, 2020, to enhance the liquidity and 
functioning of money markets. Under the MMLF, the FRBB 
makes nonrecourse advances to participating financial 
institutions to purchase certain types of assets from eligible 
money market mutual fund clients. These assets, which are 
reflected in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets, are pledged to the FRBB as collateral. On March 23, 
2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final 
rule to neutralize the effects of purchasing assets through 
the program on risk-based and leverage-based capital 
ratios. As of March 31, 2020 the Firm excluded assets 
purchased from money market mutual fund clients pursuant 
to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF in the 
amount of $12.0 billion from its RWA and $1.2 billion from 
adjusted average assets and total leverage exposure. 

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
pandemic on pages 10-11 for additional information on 
regulatory actions and significant financing programs that 
the U.S. government and regulators have introduced to 
address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stress Capital Buffer.  On March 4, 2020, the Federal 
Reserve issued the final rule introducing a stress capital 
buffer (“SCB”) framework for the Basel III Standardized 
approach that is designed to more closely integrate the 
results of the quantitative assessment in CCAR with the 
ongoing minimum capital requirements for BHCs under the 
U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule replaces the static 2.5% 
CET1 capital conservation buffer in the Standardized 
approach with a dynamic institution-specific SCB. The final 
rule does not apply to the Advanced approach capital 
requirements. The SCB requirement for BHCs will be 
effective on October 1 of each year and is expected to 
remain in effect until September 30 of the following year. 
The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve will disclose 
the Firm’s SCB requirement and summary information 
regarding the Firm’s stress test results by June 30, 2020. 
Starting on October 1, 2020, the SCB will take effect based

consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. Refer to line of business equity on page 90 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional 
information on capital allocation.

Planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”)
On April 6, 2020, the Firm submitted its 2020 Capital Plan 
to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s 2020 
CCAR process. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve 
will disclose the Firm’s SCB requirement and summary 
information regarding the Firm’s stress test results by June 
30, 2020.

Common stock dividends 
The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend is currently 
$0.90 per share. The Firm’s dividends are subject to the 
Board of Directors’ approval on a quarterly basis.

Common equity 
The Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase 
of up to $29.4 billion of gross common equity between July 
1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 as part of the Firm’s annual 
capital plan.

On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Firm temporarily suspended through the second quarter 
of 2020 repurchases of its common equity. The decision to 
suspend these repurchases is consistent with the Firm’s 
objective to use its capital and liquidity to provide support 
to individuals, small businesses, and the broader economy 
through lending and other services.

Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA by approximately $25 billion. 
However, these increases in excess liquidity in JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. are excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR 
under the LCR rule. Refer to Note 21 for additional 
information. 

The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months 
ended March 31, 2020, compared with the prior year 
period, primarily from an increase in the average amount of 
reportable HQLA as a result of increased cash from 
unsecured long-term debt issuances. 

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, 
due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows 
as a result of ongoing business activity. 

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, 
the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as 
equity securities and fixed income debt securities, that the 
Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This 
includes securities included as part of the excess HQLA at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-
bank affiliates, as described above. The fair value of these 
securities was approximately $432 billion and $315 billion 
as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, however, the amount of liquidity that could be 
raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. 
The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2019, 
due to an increase in excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. and an increase in CIB trading assets during the 
quarter.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs 
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a 
result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $317 billion and $322 billion as of 
March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This 
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and 
securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other 
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the 
Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central 
banks.  Although available, the Firm does not view this 
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and the other central banks as a primary source of 
liquidity.  

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 93–98 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of 
unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) that is 
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over 
a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. 
Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% 
minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to 
non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s 
reported HQLA.  The LCR is required to be a minimum of 
100%. For additional information on HQLA and net cash 
outflows, refer to page 94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports.

The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for 
the three months ended March 31, 2020, December 31, 
2019 and March 31, 2019 based on the Firm’s 
interpretation of the finalized LCR framework.

securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(d)  Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are 

not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months 
ended March 31, 2020, compared with the three-month 
period ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an 
increase in CIB market activities and long-term debt 
maturities. Liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
increased during the quarter primarily due to deposits net 
of loan growth. Deposits increased in March as a result of 
market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Additionally, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve, 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced reserve 
requirements to zero percent, which increased JPMorgan

Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured 
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance 
sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of 

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the 
Parent company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by 
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid 
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk 
characteristics.  

Deposits
The table below summarizes, by LOB, the deposit balances as of March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, and the average

(a)  In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The prior-   

period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of 
total liabilities, as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 
2019.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during 
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits across the Firm increased for the three 
months ended March 31, 2020. CIB deposits increased 
largely driven by continued growth in client activity. CB 
deposits increased predominantly driven by growth in 
interest-bearing deposits. AWM deposits increased largely 
driven by growth in time deposits. Average balances for CIB, 
CB and AWM were also impacted by net inflows in the month 
of March as a result of market conditions driven by 
COVID-19 pandemic concerns. CCB deposits increased 
driven by continued growth in new accounts. 

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment 
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on 
pages 21–37 and pages 15-16, respectively, for further 
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

(a)  Primarily consists of short-term securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.

(c)  Included in beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(d)  Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured debt issued by the Parent Company.
(e)  Includes long-term structured notes which are secured.
(f)  Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 39–44 and Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity on page 83 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 21 and 

Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by 
high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued 
debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities 
loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased at 
March 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, from 
client-driven market-making activities as a result of changes in 
market conditions in March and higher financing of trading 
assets-debt instruments when compared with lower levels at 
year-end in CIB.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of 
the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

As of March 31, 2020, the Firm has participated in several of 
the U.S. government facilities, including the MMLF. The 
secured nonrecourse advances under the MMLF are included 

in other borrowed funds. Refer to Capital Risk Management on 
pages 39-44 for additional information on the MMLF. 
In addition, the Firm is participating in the PDCF established 
by the Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020, which allows 
primary dealers to support smooth market functioning by 
facilitating the availability of credit to businesses and 
households. Under the PDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York (“FRBNY”) provides collateralized financing on a term 
basis to primary dealers. At March 31, 2020, these financing 
transactions were reported as securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase. The PDCF will remain available to 
primary dealers for at least six months, or longer if conditions 
warrant. 
The Firm also continues to participate in the Federal Reserve’s 
open market operations.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily 
consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The 
decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2020, from 
December 31, 2019, was due to lower net issuance primarily 
for short-term liquidity management.

47

The Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through 
securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB 
advances. The following table summarizes the securitization 
issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities 
or redemptions for the three months ended March 31, 
2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for 
client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan 
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding 
for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer 
to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further 
description of the client-driven loan securitizations.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable 
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, 
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, 
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include 
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various 
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its 
optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured 
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary 
funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC 
does not issue debt to external counterparties. The 
following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance 
and maturities or redemptions for the three months ended 
March 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 93–98 and Note 20 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the 
IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 18, and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
5 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of March 31, 2020, 
except as noted below, were as follows:

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to 
pages 50–65 for a further discussion of Credit Risk.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.

In the following tables, reported loans include loans 
retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and 
certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following 
tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at 
fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 
and 3 for further information regarding these loans. Refer 
to Notes 12, 23, and 5 for additional information on the 
Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative 
receivables, including the Firm’s accounting policies.

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk 
inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and 
refer to Note 11 for information regarding the credit risk 
inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52-55 and Note 12 for 
further discussions of the consumer credit environment and 
consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on 
pages 56-63 and Note 12 as well as the wholesale credit 
environment and wholesale loans.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL 
accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in 
the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD 
loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, 
the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related 
commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card 
portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to 
align with the methodology applied in determining the 
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to 
conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for 
further information.

On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies along with 
the National Credit Union Administration and the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the state

Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk 
Management on pages 100–118 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019

Investment Risk Management framework.

financial regulators, issued an interagency statement 
revising a March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan 
modifications and the reporting for financial institutions 
working with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic 
(the “IA Statement”). The IA Statement reconfirmed that 
supervised institutions will not be directed to automatically 
categorize all COVID-19 related loan modifications as 
troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”), including short-term 
and other insignificant modifications such as payment 
delays, fee waivers and extensions of repayment terms, and 
modifications or other programs mandated by the federal 
or state governments. The IA Statement also provides that 
loans that were current prior to these modifications should 
generally not be reported as past due or nonaccrual. 
Additionally, the IA Statement outlines accounting and 
reporting considerations for eligible loan modifications for 
which a financial institution elects to apply the CARES Act 
and forgo TDR accounting.

The Firm’s initial response to many borrowers impacted by 
the COVID-19 pandemic included offering loan 
modifications, such as 90-day payment delays and waiving 
or refunding certain fees. These modifications are intended 
to mitigate adverse affects on borrowers due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Instances of these modifications will 
likely rise over the course of the second quarter of 2020. 
The effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping borrowers 
recover and mitigating credit losses remains uncertain in 
light of the unpredictable nature and duration of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the Firm’s initial short-
term payment delays and other insignificant modifications 
was not material to the performance of and credit-related 
information for the consumer and wholesale credit 
portfolios during the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

government agencies of $616 million and $961 million, respectively, 
and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$29 million and $41 million, respectively. These amounts have been 
excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the 
Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed 
on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”).

(e)  At March 31, 2020, nonperforming loans included $970 million of PCD 
loans on nonaccrual status. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual 
loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on 
each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and 
business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime 
segment of the consumer credit market. Refer to Note 12 for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s 
nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 23 for further information on lending-related commitments.

Recent deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an increase 
in the allowance for credit losses. As of March 31, 2020, the impacts of the macroeconomic environment have had only a limited 
impact to consumer credit performance. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
macroeconomic environment could result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual loans and 
charge-offs.

and Corporate.

has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain 
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing 
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 23 for further information.

(e)  Includes billed interest and fees.
(f)  Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(g)  At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies 

of $616 million and $961 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In 
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the 
FFIEC.

(h)  At March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $970 million of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm 

recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(i)  Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts 

were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances decreased from December 31, 2019 due to 
lower residential real estate loans, predominantly driven by 
loan sales. 

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly 
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of 
credit. The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2019 
driven by paydowns and loan sales in Home Lending, largely 
offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have 
been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the 
three months ended March 31, 2020 were higher when 
compared with the same period in the prior year as the 
current quarter benefited from a recovery on a loan sale.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $27.9 billion at March 31, 2020. This 
amount included $10.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $9.0 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the carrying 
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $22.8 
billion and $22.5 billion, respectively. These loans have an 
interest-only payment period generally followed by an 
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the three months 
ended March 31, 2020 was in line with the performance of 
the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same 
period.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. 
The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential 
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the 
allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio 
predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto and 
business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio 
was relatively flat when compared with December 31, 
2019, as paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of 
delinquent loans were predominantly offset by new 
originations. The scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates 
were 0.41% and 0.50% for the three months ended March 
31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic 
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s 
residential real estate loans.

Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to 
modified retained residential real estate loans for which 
concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified 
loans accounted for as PCI loans prior to the adoption of 
CECL. The following table does not include loans with short-
term or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs. Refer

(a)  At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, $11 million and $14 

million, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from 
Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate 
government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table 
above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in 
accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back 
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform 
become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for additional 
information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with 
Ginnie Mae.

(b)  At March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans 

included $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of troubled debt 
restructurings (“TDRs”) for which the borrowers were less than 90 
days past due. Refer to Note 12 for additional information about loans 
modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

(c)  At March 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $725 million of PCD 
loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI 
loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans 
as each of the pools was performing.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2019 
due to seasonality and a decline in sales volume in March as 
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The March 31, 2020 
30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.96% and 1.02%, 
respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 
2019 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and 
0.95%, respectively due to the decline in credit card loans 
noted above. Net charge-offs increased for the three 
months ended March 31, 2020 when compared with the 
same period in the prior year due to loan growth, in line 
with prior expectations.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At both March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Firm 
had $1.5 billion of credit card loans outstanding that have 
been modified in TDRs, which does not include loans with 
short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for additional 
information about loan modification programs to 
borrowers.

CIB and AWM; these are classified in accrued interest and accounts 
receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(b)  Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk 
primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, 
and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating services 
(such as cash management and clearing activities), securities 
financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of 
the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale 
businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The 
Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it 
originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan 
business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit 
risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by 
conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality 
and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where 
applicable, and of industry, product and client 
concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 
58–61 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate as well as risk-rated business 
banking and auto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the 
wholesale methodology is applied for determining the 
allowance for credit losses.

Recent deterioration in the macroeconomic environment 
driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
pressure on oil prices resulted in an increase in the allowance 
for credit losses with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, 
Real Estate and Consumer and Retail industries. As of March 
31, 2020, the impacts of the macroeconomic environment 
have had only a limited impact to the overall credit profile, 
with the investment-grade percentage at 73% versus 74% at 
December 31, 2019. However, criticized exposure increased 
$6.6 billion from December 31, 2019 to $21.7 billion at 
March 31, 2020, but remains at relatively low levels 
compared to the overall size of the portfolio. The increase 
was largely driven by downgrades in Oil & Gas resulting from 
lower oil prices and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and in Consumer & Retail primarily due to impacts from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The continuation or worsening of the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic 
environment could result in further impacts to credit quality 
metrics, including investment-grade percentages, as well as 
to criticized and nonperforming exposures and charge-offs.

Retained loans increased by $73.6 billion in the three 
months ended March 31, 2020, predominantly driven by the 
CIB and CB, largely to commercial and industrial clients, and 
predominantly driven by drawdowns on committed revolving 
credit facilities, which resulted in a corresponding decrease 
in unfunded lending-related commitments. These 
drawdowns, which were driven by increased activity in March 
that returned to more normalized levels in April, were largely 
made by investment-grade clients, and can be broadly 
attributed to:
•  companies in industries directly and immediately impacted 

by the COVID-19 pandemic;

•  stress in the commercial paper funding markets, and

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of March 31,

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. 

The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding 
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $21.7 billion 
at March 31, 2020, compared with $15.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The increase was largely driven by 
downgrades in Oil & Gas resulting from lower oil prices and 
impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and downgrades in 
Consumer & Retail primarily due to impacts from the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

Presented below is additional detail on certain of the Firm’s largest industry exposures and/or certain industries which present 
potential heightened credit concerns.

Real Estate
Real Estate exposure was $148.2 billion as of March 31, 2020, largely driven by multifamily lending as shown in the table 
below. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 the investment-grade portion of the portfolio increased from 81% to 
83%, while the drawn percentage increased from 78% to 83%. Retail-related Real Estate and Lodging exposure within Other 
in the table below was $15.1 billion as of March 31, 2020 of which 74% was investment-grade; noninvestment-grade Retail

Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas exposure was $42.8 billion as of March 31, 2020, including $21.5 billion of Exploration & Production and Oilfield 
Services as shown in the table below. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the investment-grade portion of the Oil 
& Gas portfolio decreased from 53% to 52%, and the drawn percentage of this portfolio increased from 31% to 37%, both 
driven by lower oil prices and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, criticized exposure increased by $2.6 billion 
from $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 to $4.2 billion at March 31, 2020, also driven by lower oil prices and impacts from 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 12 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2020 
and 2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans in the first 
quarter of 2020 reflects select downgrades across a 
number of sectors, including Oil & Gas.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $81.6 billion and $49.8 
billion at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from market 
movements, including the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of 
the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral 
held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the 
appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take 
into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. 
government and agency securities and other group of seven 
nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash 
collateral held by the Firm aggregating $26.2 billion and 
$16.0 billion at March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, that may be used as security when the fair 
value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. 

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the table above, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair 
value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit 
enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 23 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers primarily represent held-for-
investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and 
AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the 
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such no 
allowance for credit losses is held against these receivables. 
To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin 
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on 
an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional 
cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when 
appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued 
interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other 
market risk exposure. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of derivative contracts.

The following table summarizes the net derivative 
receivables for the periods presented.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to 
mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s 
over-the-counter  derivative  contracts  subject  to  collateral 
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which 
are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their 
short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled 
daily — was approximately 86% and 90% at March 31, 2020,  
and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management” activities). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL 
accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance 
established a single allowance framework for all financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance 
sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that 
management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the 
instrument’s remaining expected life and considers 
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. 
Refer to Note 1 for further information.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises:

•  the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the balance sheet,

•  the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the balance sheet in accounts payable and 
other liabilities, and

•  the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
recognized within Investment Securities on the balance 
sheet.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 for a description of the 
policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine 
the Firm’s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-
related commitments, and investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses increased compared with 
December 31, 2019, reflecting:

•  additions of $6.8 billion associated with the deterioration 

in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued pressure 
on oil prices including:

–  $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in Credit Card, 

reflecting the deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, and

–  a net $2.4 billion in wholesale, primarily reflecting the 
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment as a 
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across 
multiple sectors, and continued pressure on oil prices, 
with the largest impacts in the Oil & Gas, Real Estate, and 
Consumer & Retail industries, and

•  a net $4.3 billion addition as a result of the adoption of 

CECL.

In light of the rapidly evolving economic conditions and 
forecasts during March 2020, management updated its 
macroeconomic forecast near the end of its credit loss 
estimation process in early April. This macroeconomic 
forecast included a decline in the U.S. real GDP of 
approximately 25% and an increase in the U.S. 
unemployment rate to above 10%, both in the second 
quarter, followed by a solid recovery in the second half of 
2020. In addition, the allowances for loan losses and 
lending-related commitments reflect the estimated impact 
of the Firm’s payment relief actions as well as the federal 
government’s stimulus programs related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related 
estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses 
in future periods.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 75–77 for further information on the allowance for 
credit losses and related management judgments.

Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52–55, 
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 56–63 and Note 12 for 
additional information on the consumer and wholesale 
credit portfolios.

The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD 
loans. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from 
the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology 
applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer 
to Note 1 for further information.

(a)  Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated 
losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan 
was removed from a pool.

(b)  Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that 

have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably 
expected to be modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c)  The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.
(d)  Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $19 million and a provision for credit losses of $9 million as of and for the three 

months ended March 31, 2020.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At March 31, 2020, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $469.1 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
page 37 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 67–71 for 
further information on the market risk inherent in the 
portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 45–
49 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically private non-traded 
financial instruments representing ownership or other 
forms of junior capital. Principal investments span multiple 
asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business platform. In 
general, new principal investments include tax-oriented 
investments, as well as investments made to enhance or 
accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. The carrying values of the principal 
investment portfolios have not been significantly affected 
by recent market events as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic. However, in the event that deterioration of the 
macroeconomic environment accelerates and/or economic 
recovery becomes delayed, certain principal investments 
could be subject to impairments, write-downs, or other 
negative impacts.

As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the 
aggregate carrying values of the principal investment 
portfolios were $23.8 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively, 
which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable 
housing and alternative energy investments) of $18.2 
billion at the end of both periods, and private equity, 
various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $5.6 
billion and $6.0 billion, respectively.

a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio Risk 
Management governance and oversight.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities 
held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 119–126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business 
activities that give rise to market risk. 

COVID-19 Pandemic   
Market Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by 
leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and may be limited in their ability to measure 
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur, such as those observed during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 74.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. This is increasingly 
important in periods of sustained, heightened market 
volatility.  

Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques 
and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may 
affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to 
Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 121 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding VaR, including the inherent 
limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at:
(http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm) 
for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 124-126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a)  Average portfolio VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification 

effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated.

(b)  Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification 
benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for 
each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.

Average VaR across the risk types and LOBs were generally higher due to increased volatility as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Quarter over quarter results
Average total VaR increased by $22 million for the three 
months ended March 31, 2020 as compared with the prior 
quarter. This reflects substantial increases in volatility 
which occurred towards the end of the quarter, affecting the 
fixed income risk type. Maximum VaR for the quarter was 
$164 million, also driven by the increased volatility.

Year over year results
Average total VaR increased by $7 million for the three 
months ended March 31, 2020, compared with the same 
period in the prior year. This reflects an increase in the fixed 
income risk type driven by substantial increases in volatility,  
and increased exposure in the equities risk type due to the 
inclusion of Tradeweb following its IPO in the second 
quarter of 2019, partially offset by the exit of certain CIB 
investments. The fixed income and equities risk type 
increases were partially offset by reduced exposure in the 
foreign exchange risk type.

In addition, average CCB VaR has increased by $5 million, 
driven by MSR risk management activities. 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of 
VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of 
interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit 
spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included 
these positions in other sensitivity-based measures. This 
change was made to more appropriately align the risk from 
changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option 
elected liabilities in a single market risk measure. In the 
absence of this refinement, the average Total VaR for the 
three months ended March 31, 2020 would have been 
higher by $6 million and each of the components would 
have been higher by the amounts reported in the following 
table:

VaR backtesting 
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s 
revenue results as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new 
transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation 
adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains 
and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for 
backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the 12 
months ended March 31, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market 
Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to 
the Firm’s covered positions.

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2020, the Firm observed 15 VaR backtesting exceptions and posted backtesting gains on 
140 of the 260 days. The Firm observed eight VaR backtesting exceptions, due to volatility resulting from the COVID-19 
pandemic, and posted backtesting gains on 44 of the 64 days, for three months ended March 31, 2020. The number of VaR 
backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level 
of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the 
VaR calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days differ from the two loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity 
Markets posted losses, as disclosed in the CIB Markets revenue results, as the population of positions which compose each 
metric are different and due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as 
described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue results, refer to page 29.

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension 
of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing 
debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. 
Refer to the table on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying 
positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is 
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long 
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude 
other positions in risk management VaR and other 
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 120 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:

•  The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

•  Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate 
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based 
on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with 
underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, 
and other factors which are updated periodically based 
on historical experience.

•  The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized 
deposit betas which represent the amount by which 
deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in 
market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates 
paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates 
paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to repricing lags 
and other factors.

70

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other 
factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate 
exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a 
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to 2020 
Outlook on page 7 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of March 
31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 reflected 
updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and 
long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the 
Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to an upward shift in short-term and 
long-term rates reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for 
lower rates.

31, 2020, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in 
negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an 
interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a 
negative interest rate policy. In a negative rate 
environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain 
assets and liabilities require additional management 
judgment.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 127–128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on countries to which the Firm 
has exposure, leveraging existing stress testing, exposure 
reporting, controls and tailored analysis.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2020 and their 
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2019. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country 
risk management approach, and does not represent the 
Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit 
conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to 
period due to client activity and market flows. 

The overall increase in top 20 exposures was largely driven 
by client activity and demand for liquidity, relative to the 
period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an 
increase in cash placements primarily with the central 
banks of Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia. In 
addition, the Firm held a larger inventory in Brazilian 
government bonds.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm’s Technology and Cybersecurity operations 
continue to monitor the Firm’s systems 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week including responding to threat activity 
using COVID-19 themes in phishing and other social 
engineering campaigns.

The Technology function is actively supporting the Firm’s 
response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including the Firm’s expanded use of remote collaboration 
tools and platforms. Technology diligently monitors the 
operational performance of the Firm’s infrastructure to 
support increased market volumes as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse 
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 129-131 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
132, Conduct Risk Management on page 133, Legal Risk 
Management on page 134 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and Technology Resiliency Risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or 
telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party 
to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit 
strikes, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of 
infectious diseases or pandemics. The safety of the Firm’s 
employees and customers is of the highest priority. The 
Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm 
to recover its critical business functions and supporting 
assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a 
business interruption. The program includes governance, 
awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as 
well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, 
and manage business interruption and public safety risks. 
The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency 
program has played an integral role in maintaining the 
Firm’s business operations during and after various events.

73

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions, measurement of risk, sizing the 
allowance for credit losses, assessing regulatory capital 
requirements, conducting stress testing, and making 
business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly different 
from the historical macroeconomic environments upon 
which the models were calibrated, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 75–77 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 135 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments and investment securities. 
The allowance for credit losses comprises:

•  The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

•  The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

•  The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters. Refer to Note 10 and 
Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s policies, 
methodologies, and judgments used to determine the Firm’s 
allowance for credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. In light of the rapidly evolving economic 
conditions and forecasts during March 2020, management 
updated its macroeconomic forecast near the end of its 
credit loss estimation process in early April. However, 
changes in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates regarding 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor 
market and weak overall economic conditions that will 
affect borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale 
lending portfolios, and significant judgment is required to 
estimate the severity and duration of the current economic 

75

downturn, as well as its potential impact on borrower 
defaults and loss severities. In particular, macroeconomic 
conditions and forecasts regarding the duration and 
severity of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain highly 
uncertain, and it is difficult to predict exactly how borrower 
behavior will be impacted by these changes in economic 
conditions. The effectiveness of government support, 
customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits 
should act as mitigants to credit losses, but the extent of 
the mitigation impact remains uncertain. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

However, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using two of the five different 
macroeconomic scenarios considered in the quantitative 
calculations used in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. Each scenario 
included a full suite of macroeconomic variables, but 
differed in the levels, paths and peaks of those variables 
over the eight-quarter forecast period. The maximum 
difference in macroeconomic variables between the two 
scenarios over the eight-quarter forecast period was 
represented by an approximate 3.5% deterioration in U.S. 
real GDP, an approximate 250 basis point increase in the 
U.S. unemployment rate, and an approximate 10.5% 
deterioration in the national house price index. 

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:

•  the changes in the macroeconomic variables are not 
intended to imply management’s expectation of the 
extent or nature of future deterioration in 
macroeconomic variables

•  the impacts of changes in many macroeconomic variables 
are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this 
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe 
changes in macroeconomic variables

•  the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many 

macroeconomic variables at a speed and to degrees not 
seen in recent history, adding increased uncertainty 
around credit loss estimates

•  significant changes in the expected severity and duration 

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, the effects of government support and 

customer relief, and the speed of the subsequent 
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities described below

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts, the difference between these two 
scenarios would have generated the following effects on the 
Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of March 31, 2020, 
without considering any offsetting or correlated effects in 
other components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses 
for these lending exposures:

•  An increase of approximately $0.9 billion for residential 

real estate loans and lending-related commitments

•  An increase of approximately $1.5 billion for credit card 

loans

•  An increase of approximately $0.8 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as they do not reflect any 
potential changes in the adjustment to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2020.

Fair value 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for 
further information.

(a)  For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total 

reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $9.7 billion of 
derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting 
adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on 
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 
balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the 
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 
therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, 
judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant 
than those required when estimating the fair value of 
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of 

76

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill 
impairment on page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
March 31, 2020.

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $6.7 billion and $6.4 
billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
pages 137-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant assumptions and judgments 
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with 
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

observability of certain significant inputs requires 
management to assess all relevant empirical data in 
deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction 
details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, 
default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, 
valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange 
rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including 
unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty, as was experienced in the period ended March 
31, 2020, judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

 •  Establishes a single allowance framework for all 
financial assets measured at amortized cost and 
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This 
framework requires that management’s estimate 
reflects credit losses over the instrument’s 
remaining expected life and considers expected 
future changes in macroeconomic conditions.

 •  Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and 

requires recognition of the nonaccretable 
difference as an increase to the allowance for 
expected credit losses on financial assets 
purchased with more than insignificant credit 
deterioration since origination, with a 
corresponding increase in the amortized cost of 
the related loans. 

 •  Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, 

limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-
offs, when estimating the allowance for credit 
losses for in scope financial assets (including 
collateral-dependent assets).

 •  Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS 

securities to incorporate an allowance, which will 
allow for reversals of credit impairments in the 
event that the credit of an issuer improves.

 •  Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings as of the beginning of the 
reporting period of adoption.

 •  Requires recognition of an impairment loss when 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls 
below its carrying value.

 •  Eliminates the requirement that an impairment 
loss be recognized only if the estimated implied 
fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying 
value.

 •  Provides optional expedients and exceptions to 
current accounting guidance when financial 
instruments, hedging relationships, and other 
transactions are amended due to reference rate 
reform.

 •  Provides an election to account for certain 

contract amendments related to reference rate 
reform as modifications rather than 
extinguishments without the requirement to 
assess the significance of the amendments.

 •  Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedging 
relationship without automatic termination of 
that relationship. Provides various practical 
expedients and elections designed to allow 
hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted 
during the transition period.

 •  Provides a one-time election to transfer

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-
looking statements. These statements can be identified by the 
fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as 
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” 
“goal,” “believe,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-
looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase’s current 
expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, 
results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this 
Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the 
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in 
its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In 
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make forward-
looking statements orally to investors, analysts, 
representatives of the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to 
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm’s 
control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may differ 
materially from those set forth in its forward-looking 
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks 
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
