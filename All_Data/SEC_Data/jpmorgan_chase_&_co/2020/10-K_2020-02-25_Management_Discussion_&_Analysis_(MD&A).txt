Firmwide overview
JPMorgan Chase reported strong results for 2019, with 
record revenue, net income and EPS of $115.6 billion, 
$36.4 billion and $10.72 per share, respectively. The Firm 
reported ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 19%.

•  Net income was $36.4 billion, up 12%. 

•  Total net revenue increased 6%. Net interest income was 
$57.2 billion, up 4%, driven by continued balance sheet 
growth and mix as well as higher average short-term 
rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. 
Noninterest revenue was $58.4 billion, up 8%, driven by 
growth across CCB as well as higher Markets revenue in 
CIB. Noninterest revenue included approximately $500 
million of gains on the sales of certain mortgage loans in 
Home Lending.

•  Noninterest expense was $65.5 billion, up 3%, driven by 
continued investments across the businesses including 
employees, technology, real estate, and marketing, as 
well as higher volume- and revenue-related expenses, 
including depreciation expense on auto lease assets, 
partially offset by lower FDIC charges.

•  Income tax expense included $1.1 billion of tax benefits 

related to the resolution of certain tax audits. 

•  The provision for credit losses was $5.6 billion, up $714 

million, reflecting increases in both wholesale and 
consumer. The increase in the wholesale provision 
reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the 
current year on select client downgrades. The prior year 
reflected a benefit related to a single name in the Oil & 
Gas portfolio and higher recoveries. The increase in the 
consumer provision reflects higher net charge-offs and 
additions to the allowance for loan losses in Card, 
predominantly offset by a higher reduction in the 
allowance for loan losses in Home Lending. The prior year 
also benefited from larger recoveries in Home Lending on 
loan sales.

•  The total allowance for credit losses was $14.3 billion at 

December 31, 2019, and the Firm had a loan loss 
coverage ratio of 1.39%, flat compared with the prior 
year; excluding the PCI portfolio, the equivalent ratio was 
1.31% compared with 1.23% in the prior year. The 
Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $4.5 billion at 
December 31, 2019, a decrease from $5.2 billion in the 
prior year, primarily reflecting paydowns in the wholesale 
portfolio and improved credit performance in the 
consumer portfolio.

•  Firmwide average total loans of $955 billion were up 1%, 
or up 3% excluding the impact of certain loan sales in 
Home Lending.

Selected capital-related metrics 
•  The Firm’s CET1 capital was $188 billion, and the 

Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.4% and 
13.4%, respectively.

•  The Firm’s SLR was 6.3%.

•  The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share 

(“TBVPS”), ending 2019 at $60.98, up 8%.

ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer 
to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures 
on pages 57–59, and Capital Risk Management on pages 
85–92 for a further discussion of each of these measures.

Recent events
On February 25, 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced 
additional steps in its initiatives to address climate change 
and further promote sustainable development by 
committing to facilitate $200 billion in financing in 2020 
that will align with the objectives of the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals. This new commitment 
includes $50 billion in financing for green initiatives. The 
new commitment is intended to address a broader set of 
challenges in the developing world and developed countries 
where social and economic development gaps persist. As 
part of this commitment, the Firm had previously 
announced the creation of the J.P. Morgan Development 
Finance Institution to expand its financing activities for 
developing countries.

On December 18, 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced that 
the China Securities Regulatory Commission has approved 
the application of J.P. Morgan Securities (China) Company 
Limited for a Securities and Futures Business Permit. This 
approval allows J.P. Morgan’s majority-owned securities 
company in China to commence operations.

On December 11, 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced certain 
organizational changes to its U.S. Wealth Management 
business. The Firm’s advisors across Chase Wealth 
Management and J.P. Morgan Securities will become one 
business unit – U.S. Wealth Management.

2020 outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management and are subject to significant risks and 
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 
141, and the Risk Factors section on pages 6–28 of the Firm’s 
2019 Form 10-K, for a further discussion of certain of those 
risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause 
JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because 
of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that 
actual results in 2019 will be in line with the outlook set forth 
below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any 
forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2020 should be viewed 
against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, 
financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the 
competitive environment, client and customer activity 
levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the 
U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each 
of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and 
its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate 
adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to 
ongoing developments in the business, economic, 
regulatory, and legal environments in which it operates.

Firmwide full-year 2020
•  Management expects full-year 2020 net interest income, 
on a managed basis, to be approximately $57 billion, 
market dependent, reflecting the impact of lower interest 
rates offset by balance sheet growth and mix.

•  The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to 
managing expenses, while investing for growth and 
innovation. As a result, management expects Firmwide 
adjusted expense for the full-year 2020 to be 
approximately $67 billion.

•  The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at very 
low levels, reflecting favorable credit trends across the 
consumer and wholesale portfolios. Management expects 
full-year 2020 net charge-offs to be just over $6 billion, 
an increase from prior year, driven by Card on growth and 
mix.

•  Management expects the full-year 2020 effective tax 

rate, on a reported basis, to be approximately 20%, and 
approximately 5 to 7 percentage points higher on a 
managed basis.

First-quarter 2020
•  Management expects first-quarter 2020 net interest 

income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $14.2 
billion, market dependent.

•  Firmwide adjusted expense for the first-quarter 2020 is 

expected to be approximately $17 billion.

•  The effective tax rate, on a reported basis, for the first 
quarter of 2020 is expected to be approximately 17% 
largely as a result of tax benefits related to the vesting of 
employee share-based awards.

•  Markets revenue for the first-quarter of 2020 is expected 
to be higher when compared with the prior-year quarter 
by mid-teens percentage points, depending on market 
conditions.

The Firm is focused on the following key areas to ensure 
continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory and legal 
entity readiness; client readiness; and business and 
operational readiness. Following are the significant updates.

Regulatory and legal entity readiness
The Firm’s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and 
Ireland are now prepared and licensed to provide services 
to the Firm’s EU clients, including a branch network 
covering locations such as Paris, Madrid and Milan.

Client readiness
The agreements covering a significant proportion of the 
Firm’s EU client activity have been re-documented to other 
EU legal entities to help facilitate continuation of service. 
The Firm continues to actively engage with clients that have 
not completed re-documentation to ensure preparedness 
both in terms of documentation and any operational 
changes that may be required. The Firm may be negatively 
impacted by any operational disruption stemming from 
delays of or lapses in the readiness of other market 
participants or market infrastructures.

Business and operational readiness
The Firm relocated certain employees during 2019 and 
added specific employees to certain EU legal entities, where 
appropriate, to support the level of client activity that has 
been migrated. The Firm’s longer term staffing plan will 
develop in accordance with the increasing level of activity in 
the EU entities and alongside the future legal and 
regulatory framework between the U.K. and EU. The Firm 
continues to closely monitor legislative developments, and 
its implementation plan allows for flexibility given the 
continued uncertainties.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Business Developments
Departure of the U.K. from the EU
The U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly 
referred to as “Brexit,” occurred on January 31, 2020.

Following this departure, the U.K. has entered a transition 
period that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020. 
The purpose of the transition period is to enable the U.K. 
and the EU to negotiate the terms of their future 
relationship. The transition period can be extended, but 
both sides need to agree to extend it by July 1, 2020. It is 
not clear whether the terms of the future relationship can 
be agreed before the end of 2020, and so significant 
uncertainty remains about the relationship between the 
U.K. and the EU after the end of the transition period.

The Firm has a long-standing presence in the U.K., which 
currently serves as the regional headquarters of the Firm’s 
operations in over 30 countries across Europe, the Middle 
East, and Africa (“EMEA”). In the region, the Firm serves 
clients and customers across its business segments. The 
Firm has approximately 17,000 employees in the U.K., of 
which approximately two-thirds are in London, with 
operational and technology support centers in locations 
such as Bournemouth, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

In light of the ongoing uncertainty, the Firm continues to 
execute the relevant elements of its Firmwide Brexit 
Implementation program with the objective of being able to 
continue delivering the Firm’s capabilities to its EU clients.  
The program covers strategic implementation across all 
impacted businesses and functions and includes an ongoing 
assessment of implementation risks including political, legal 
and regulatory risks and plans for addressing and mitigating 
those risks under any scenario, including where the U.K. and 
the EU fail to reach an agreement on their future 
relationship by the end of 2020 and the transition period is 
not extended.

The principal operational risks associated with Brexit 
continue to be the potential for disruption caused by 
insufficient preparations by individual market participants 
or in the overall market ecosystem, and risks related to 
potential disruptions of connectivity among market 
participants. There continues to be regulatory and legal 
uncertainty with respect to various matters including 
contract continuity, access by market participants to 
liquidity in certain products, such as products subject to 
potentially conflicting U.K. and EU regulatory requirements 
in relation to eligible trading venues, including certain 
cross-border derivative contracts and equities that are 
listed on both U.K. and EU exchanges, as well as ongoing 
access to central banks. It is uncertain as to whether any of 
these issues will be resolved in the negotiations, or whether 
any of the previous temporary solutions will be available at 
the end of the transition period to mitigate these risks.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

IBOR transition
As a result of the expected discontinuation of certain 
unsecured benchmark interest rates, including the London 
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other Interbank 
Offered Rates (“IBORs”) regulators and market participants 
in various jurisdictions have been working to identify 
alternative reference rates that are compliant with the 
International Organization of Securities Commission’s 
standards for transaction-based benchmarks. In the U.S., 
the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”), a 
group of market and official sector participants, identified 
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its 
recommended alternative benchmark rate. Other 
alternative reference rates have been recommended in 
other jurisdictions. Industry sources estimate that IBORs are 
referenced in approximately $400 trillion of wholesale and 
consumer transactions globally spanning a broad range of 
financial products and contracts. The Firm has a significant 
number of IBOR-referenced contracts, including derivatives, 
bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and 
preferred stock issuances.  

To manage the risks associated with the transition from 
IBORs, JPMorgan Chase established a Firmwide LIBOR 
Transition program in early 2018 that is overseen by the 
Firmwide CFO and the CEO of the CIB. When assessing risks 
associated with IBOR transition, the program monitors a 
variety of scenarios, including disorderly transition, 
measured/regulated transition considering volatility along 
the SOFR curve and clearinghouse plans to change their 
discount rates to alternative reference rates, and IBOR in 
continuity beyond December 2021.

The Firm continues to monitor and facilitate the transition 
by clients from IBOR-referencing products to products 
referencing alternative reference rates. The Firm’s 
transition efforts to date include:

•  ongoing implementation of new fallback provisions that 
provide for the determination of replacement rates for 
LIBOR-linked syndicated loans, securitizations, floating 
rate notes and bi-lateral business loans based on the 
recommendations of the ARRC, and introducing SOFR as a 
replacement benchmark rate for certain of these 
products;

•  planning to adopt further fallback provisions 

recommended by the ARRC, including for residential 
ARMs, in conjunction with the adoption of these 
provisions by market participants; and

•  completing its first bilateral SOFR loan in the U.S. and 
executing its first interest rate swap linked to the Euro 
short-term rate in Europe.

Market participants are continuing to work closely with the 
public sector as part of National Working Groups (“NWGs”) 
towards the common goal of facilitating an orderly 
transition from IBORs. Current NWG efforts include the 
continued development of cash and derivative markets 
referencing alternative reference rates, as well as the 
development of industry consensus for fallback language 
that would determine the replacement rates to use in 
various IBOR-indexed contracts when a particular IBOR 
ceases to be produced. The Firm is monitoring and 
providing input in the development of the IBOR Fallbacks 
Protocol of the International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (“ISDA”), which is expected to be published in 
2020, and is encouraging its clients to actively participate 
in ISDA and industry consultations in order to ensure the 
broadest possible industry engagement in and 
understanding of IBOR transition. The Firm continues to 
monitor the development of alternative reference rates in 
other jurisdictions with NWGs.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has 
confirmed that it will issue an accounting standards update 
in 2020 providing optional expedients and exceptions for 
applying generally accepted accounting principles to 
contracts and hedge relationships affected by benchmark 
reform. The International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”) has made amendments to IFRS hedge accounting 
requirements that provide relief to market participants on 
the accounting treatment of IBOR-linked products in the 
period leading up to the expected cessation of IBORs and is 
also considering further relief for the accounting impacts 
upon transition to an alternative reference rate.

The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed 
regulations that are intended to avoid adverse tax 
consequences in connection with the transition from IBORs. 
Under the proposed regulations, amendments to contracts 
meeting certain requirements will not be treated as taxable 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being 
considered by the FASB, IASB and U.S. Treasury Department 
regarding accounting and tax implications of reference rate 
reform. The Firm also continues to develop and implement 
plans to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with 
IBOR discontinuation as identified alternative reference 
rates develop and liquidity in these rates increases. The 
Firm will continue to engage with regulators and clients as 
the transition from IBORs progresses.

(a)  Included operating lease income of $5.5 billion, $4.5 billion and $3.6 
billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively.

2019 compared with 2018
Investment banking fees were relatively flat, reflecting in 
CIB:
•  higher debt underwriting fees driven by wallet share 
gains and increased activity in investment-grade and 
high-yield bonds,

offset by

•  lower advisory fees driven by a decline in industry-wide 

fees despite wallet share gains.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 66-70 and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased reflecting:

•  higher revenue in CIB, which included a gain on the initial 
public offering (“IPO”) of Tradeweb in the second quarter 
of 2019. Excluding this gain, the increase in CIB’s revenue 
was driven by:

–  higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, reflecting an 

overall strong performance, primarily in agency 
mortgage trading within Securitized Products; the 
increase in 2019 also reflected the impact of 
challenging market conditions in Credit in the fourth 
quarter of 2018; and

–  the favorable impact of tighter funding spreads on 

derivatives in Credit Adjustments & Other.

The net increase in CIB was partially offset by

•  lower revenue in AWM related to hedges on certain 

investments. The impact of these hedges was more than 
offset by higher valuation gains on the related 
investments reflected in other income 

Principal transactions revenue in Corporate was relatively 
flat, reflecting the combined impact of losses on cash 
deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, which were 
more than offset by the related net interest income earned 
on those transactions, and lower net markdowns on certain 
legacy private equity investments.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business 
performance on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB, AWM and Corporate segment results on pages 
66-70, pages 74–76 and pages 77–78, respectively, and 
Note 6 for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased primarily due 
to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in 
customer accounts and transactions, and higher lending-
related commitment fees in the wholesale businesses.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 62–65,  
pages 66-70 and pages 71–73, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased primarily due to higher asset 
management fees from growth in client investment assets 
in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 62–65 and 
pages 74–76, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 

Investment securities gains/(losses) in both periods reflect 
the impact of repositioning the investment securities 
portfolio. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 77–
78 and Note 10 for additional information.

48

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Net interest income increased driven by continued balance 
sheet growth and changes in mix, as well as higher average 
short-term rates, partially offset by higher rates paid on 
deposits.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.3 
trillion, up $133 billion, and the yield was 3.61%, up 14 
bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 
2.46%, a decrease of 6 bps. The net yield excluding CIB 
Markets was 3.27%, up 2bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial 
measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the 
Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key 
Performance Measures on pages 57–59 for a further 
discussion of this measure.

Mortgage fees and related income increased driven by:

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting 

approximately $500 million of gains on sales of certain 
loans, as well as higher mortgage production volumes 
and margins,

partially offset by

•  lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by lower 
operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds 
on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain 
loans to held-for-sale.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 62–65, Note 6 and 
15 for further information.

Card income increased as the prior year included an 
adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card 
rewards liability. Excluding this item, Card income was 
relatively flat. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 62–65 
and Note 6 for further information.
Other income increased reflecting:

•  higher operating lease income from growth in auto 

operating lease volume in CCB, and

•  higher investment valuation gains in AWM, which were 
largely offset by the impact of the related hedges that 
were reflected in principal transactions revenue,

largely offset by

•  lower other income in CIB largely related to increased 
amortization on a higher level of alternative energy 
investments. The increased amortization was more than 
offset by lower income tax expense from the associated 
tax credits.

The prior year included:

•  $505 million of fair value gains related to the adoption in 

the first quarter of 2018 of the recognition and 
measurement accounting guidance for certain equity 
investments previously held at cost.

Refer to Note 6 for further information.

2019 compared with 2018
The provision for credit losses increased driven by both the 
wholesale and consumer portfolios.
The increase in the wholesale provision reflects additions to 
the allowance for credit losses in the current year on select 
client downgrades. The prior year reflected a benefit related 
to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio and higher 
recoveries.

The increase in the total consumer provision reflects:
•  an increase in credit card due to  

–  higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with 

expectations, and

–  a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses 
reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as newer 
vintages season and become a larger part of the 
portfolio, compared to a $300 million addition in the 
prior year

largely offset by
•  a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card, in CCB due 

to  
–  a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
losses in the purchase credit-impaired (“PCI”) 
residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued 
improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and a 
$100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses 
in the non credit-impaired residential real estate 
portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the 
PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, 
and

–  a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses 

in the business banking portfolio

partially offset by
–  lower net recoveries in the residential real estate 
portfolio as the prior year benefited from larger 
recoveries on loan sales.

Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 62–65, 
CIB on pages 66-70, CB on pages 71–73, the Allowance for 
Credit Losses on pages 116–117 and Note 13 for further 
discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for 
credit losses.

The effective tax rate decreased due to the recognition of 
$1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution of 
certain tax audits, and changes in the mix of income and 
expense subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes. 
The decrease was partially offset by lower tax benefits 
related to the vesting of employee share-based awards. In 
addition, the prior year included a $302 million net tax 
benefit resulting from changes in the estimates under the 
TCJA related to the remeasurement of certain deferred 
taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings.

(b)  Included FDIC-related expense of $457 million, $1.2 billion and $1.5 
billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively.

2019 compared with 2018
Compensation expense increased driven by investments 
across the businesses, including front office, as well as 
technology staff hires.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
•  higher investments across the businesses, including 

technology, real estate and marketing 

•  higher volume-related expense, including depreciation 
from growth in auto lease assets in CCB, and brokerage 
expense in certain businesses in CIB

•  higher legal expense, and

•  higher pension costs due to changes to actuarial 

assumptions and estimates, 

largely offset by

•  lower FDIC charges as a result of the elimination of the 

surcharge at the end of the third quarter of 2018

•  the impact of efficiencies 

•  lower other regulatory-related assessments in CIB.
The prior year included a loss of $174 million on the 
liquidation of a legal entity in Corporate recorded in other 
expense. Refer to Note 24 for additional information on the 
liquidation of a legal entity.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
decreased primarily as a result of a shift in the deployment 
of cash to investment securities, and net maturities of 
short-term borrowings and long term debt in Treasury and 
CIO, partially offset by an increase in deposits. Deposits with 
banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with 
various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased as a result of client-driven market-
making activities in Fixed Income Markets in CIB and a shift 
in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and Note 10 for 
additional information.

Securities borrowed increased in CIB related to client-
driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets, 
and to cover customer short positions in prime brokerage. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and 
Note 10 for additional information.

Trading assets was relatively flat, reflecting:

•  a reduction in short-term instruments associated with 

cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO,

offset by

•  growth in client-driven activities in CIB Markets, primarily 

debt instruments, and

•  in CCB, growth related to originations of mortgage 
warehouse loans, resulting from the favorable rate 
environment.

Investment securities increased primarily due to net 
purchases of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government 
agency MBS in Treasury and CIO. The net purchases were 
primarily driven by cash deployment and interest rate risk 
management activities. Refer to Corporate segment results 
on pages 77–78, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on 
page 118 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on 
investment securities.

Loans decreased reflecting loan sales in Home Lending, and 
lower loans in CIB, primarily driven by a loan syndication 
and net paydowns, partially offset by growth in AWM and 
Card.

The allowance for loan losses decreased driven by:
•  an $800 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan 
losses, which included $650 million in the PCI residential 
real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in 
home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non 
credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 
million in the business banking portfolio; as well as  
•  a $151 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans,  
largely offset by  
•  a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in 

the credit card portfolio reflecting loan growth and  
higher loss rates as newer vintages season and become a 
larger part of the portfolio, and  

•  a $115 million addition in the wholesale allowance for 

loan losses driven by select client downgrades. 

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages

of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting:

•  continued growth driven by new accounts in CCB

•  the impact of the adoption of the new lease accounting 

•  growth in operating deposits in CIB driven by client 

activity, primarily in Treasury Services, and an increase in 
client-driven net issuances of structured notes in Markets, 
and

•  higher deposits in CB and AWM from growth in interest-

bearing deposits; for AWM, the growth was partially offset 
by migration, predominantly into the Firm’s investment-
related products.

Refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 
93–98; and Notes 2 and 17 for more information.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements was relatively flat,as the net

driven activities, and lower secured financing of trading 
assets-debt instruments, all in CIB. Refer to the Liquidity 
Risk Management discussion on pages 93–98 and Note 11 
for additional information. 
Short-term borrowings decreased reflecting lower 
commercial paper issuances and short-term advances from 
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) in Treasury and CIO, 
primarily driven by liquidity management. Refer to pages 
93–98 for information on changes in Liquidity Risk 
Management.

Operating activities 
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily 
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. 
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the 
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of 
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk 
management activities and market conditions. The Firm 
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash 
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to 
meet its operating liquidity needs.
•  In 2019, cash provided primarily reflected net income 

excluding noncash adjustments and net proceeds of sales, 
securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, 
partially offset by higher securities borrowed, an increase 
in other assets and a decrease in trading liabilities.  
•  In 2018, cash provided primarily reflected net income 
excluding noncash adjustments, increased trading 
liabilities and accounts payable and other liabilities, 
partially offset by an increase in trading assets and net 
originations of loans held-for-sale.

Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans and investing in the 
investment securities portfolio and other short-term 
instruments.
•  In 2019, cash used reflected net purchases of investment 
securities, partially offset by lower securities purchased 
under resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales 
and securitizations of loans held-for-investment. 

•  In 2018, cash used reflected an increase in securities 

purchased under resale agreements, higher net 
originations of loans and net purchases of investment 
securities.

Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer 
deposits and issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred 
and common stock.
•  In 2019, cash provided reflected higher deposits, 

partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings 
and net payments of long term borrowings. 

•  In 2018, cash provided reflected higher deposits, short-
term borrowings, and securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements, partially offset by net payments 
of long term borrowings. 

•  For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into 
various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual 
obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain 
obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others 
are disclosed off-balance sheet under accounting principles 
generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet 
arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-
purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and 
through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., 
commitments and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-
related transactions and related exposures, such as 
derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and 
guarantees. 

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to 
support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that 
transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and 
reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no 
JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs 
with which the Firm is involved where such investment 
would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct.

The table below provides an index of where in this 2019 Form 10-K a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet 
arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY
PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements 
appear on pages 146–150. That presentation, which is 
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an 
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked 
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of 
the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP 
financial statements.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the 
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide 
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. 
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each 
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an 
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that 
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures allow 

management to assess the comparability of revenue from 
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to 
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment level, because 
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide 
information to investors about the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular 
business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, 
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment 
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to 
Business Segment Results on pages 60–78 for additional 
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable 
to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other companies. 

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures

Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as
follows:

Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end

Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue

Return on assets (“ROA”)
Reported net income / Total average assets

Return on common equity (“ROE”)
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity

Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”)
Net income* / Average tangible common equity

Tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”)
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end

* Represents net income applicable to common equity

The Firm also reviews adjusted expense, which is 
noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense and 
is therefore a non-GAAP financial measure. Additionally, 
certain credit metrics and ratios disclosed by the Firm 
exclude PCI loans, and are therefore non-GAAP measures. 
Management believes that these measures help investors 
understand the effect of these items on reported results 
and provide an alternate presentation of the Firm’s 
performance. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk 
Management on pages 100–118 for additional information 
on credit metrics and ratios excluding PCI loans.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets 
businesses
In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net 
yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these 
metrics excluding CIB’s Markets businesses, as shown 
below; these metrics, which exclude CIB’s Markets 
businesses, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management 
reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the 
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability 
management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting 
metrics that exclude CIB’s Markets businesses are referred 
to as non-markets-related net interest income and net yield. 
CIB’s Markets businesses are Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of 
non-markets-related net interest income and net yield 
provides investors and analysts with other measures by 
which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends 
of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other 
financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, 
investing and deposit-raising activities.

revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied 
retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to 
conform with the current presentation.

Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS
Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common 
stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other 
than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a 
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, 
ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

Key performance measures
Core loans is considered a key performance measure. Core 
loans represents loans considered central to the Firm’s 
ongoing businesses, and excludes loans classified as trading 
assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and 
portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans is a 
measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts 
in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio.

Management’s discussion and analysis

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. 

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance 
Measures, on pages 57–59 for a definition of managed 
basis.

(a)  Effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. 

The revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business will be reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationship.

Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items, described in more detail below. The 
Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB 
on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses 
the assumptions, methodologies and reporting 
classifications used for segment reporting, and further 
refinements may be implemented in future periods.

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or service on a 
gross basis, with an allocation to the other segment(s) 
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.

60

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

 
Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
corporate support units, or another business segment, the 
costs of those services are allocated to the respective 
business segments. The expense is generally 
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services 
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related 
to corporate support units, technology and operations not 
currently leveraged by any LOB, are not allocated to the 
business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes parent company 
costs that would not be incurred if the segments were 
stand-alone businesses; adjustments to align corporate 
support units; and other items not aligned with a particular 
business segment.

Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm 
allocates interest income and expense to each business 
segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within 
Corporate. The funds transfer pricing process considers the 
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements 
on a product-by-product basis within each business 
segment. This process is overseen by senior management 
and reviewed by the Firm’s Treasurer Committee.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of 
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding 
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the 
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term 
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business 
segments is aligned with the Firm’s process to allocate 
capital. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is 
included in a business segment’s net interest income, and 
net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive 
at a business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity. 

Business segment capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer 
to Line of business equity on page 90 for additional 
information on business segment capital allocation.

(a)  Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $4.1 billion, $3.4

and 2017, respectively.

(b)  Included MSR risk management results of $(165) million, $(111)

2018 and 2017, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The provision for credit losses was $5.0 billion, an increase of 
4%, reflecting:
•  an increase in credit card due to  

–  higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with 

expectations, and 

–  a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses 
reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as newer 
vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, 
compared to a $300 million addition in the prior year

largely offset by
•  a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to  

–  a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses 

in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting 
continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, 
and a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan 
losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate 
portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI 
residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and

–  a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in 

the business banking portfolio

partially offset by
–  lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio 
as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan 
sales.

2019 compared with 2018
Net income was $16.6 billion, an increase of 12%.
Net revenue was $55.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Net 
production revenue included approximately $500 million of 
gains on the sales of certain mortgage loans that were 
predominantly offset by charges in net interest income for the 
unwind of the related internal funding from Treasury and CIO 
associated with these loans. The charges reflect the net 
present value of that funding and is recognized as interest 
income in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate on pages 77–
78 and Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) on page 61 of this Form 
10-K for further information. 
Net interest income was $37.2 billion, up 4%, and included 
charges from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding these 
charges, net interest income increased, driven by:
•  higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, as well 
as higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances in 
CBB, 

partially offset by
•  lower loan balances due to loan sales, as well as loan spread 

compression in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $18.6 billion, up 15%, and included 
gains from the loan sales mentioned above as well as the 
impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 
million to the credit card rewards liability. Excluding these 
notable items, noninterest revenue increased 9%, driven by:
•  higher auto lease volume, and
•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

production volumes and margins,

partially offset by

•  lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by lower 

operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on 
lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to 
held-for-sale.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in 
value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees 
and related income. 
Noninterest expense was $28.9 billion, up 4%, driven by:

•  investments in the business including technology and 

marketing and higher depreciation on auto lease assets,

partially offset by

•  expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.

(a)  Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI 

loans as each of the pools is performing.

(b)  At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage 
loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$961 million, $2.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. These amounts have 
been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(c)  Net charge-offs/(recoveries) and the net charge-off/(recovery) rates for the 

years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, excluded $151 million, $187 
million and $86 million, respectively, of write-offs in the PCI portfolio. These 
write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to  
Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses on page 117 for further 
information on PCI write-offs.

(d)  Excludes the impact of PCI loans. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 

and 2017, the net charge-off/(recovery) rates including the impact of PCI loans 
were as follows: (1) home equity of (0.15)%, (0.02)% and 0.14%, respectively; 
(2) residential mortgage of (0.03)%, (0.14)% and (0.01)%, respectively; (3)

U.S. government agencies of $1.7 billion, $4.1 billion and $6.2 billion, 
respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been 
excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(f)  Excludes PCI loans. The 30+ day delinquency rate for PCI loans was 8.44%, 
9.16% and 10.13% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
(g)  Excluding net charge-offs of $467 million related to the student loan portfolio 
transfer, the total net charge-off rates for the full year 2017 would have been 
1.10%.

Refer to Notes 2, 3 and 24 for additional information.

2019 compared with 2018
Net income was $11.9 billion, up 1%.
Net revenue was $38.3 billion, up 5%.

Banking revenue was $13.1 billion, up 1%.
•  Investment Banking revenue was $7.2 billion, up 3%, 
with higher debt underwriting fees, largely offset by 
lower advisory and equity underwriting fees. The Firm 
maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking 
fees with overall share gains, according to Dealogic.
–  Debt underwriting fees were $3.5 billion, up 8%, 

reflecting wallet share gains and increased activity in 
investment-grade and high-yield bonds.

–  Advisory fees were $2.4 billion, down 5%, and Equity 
underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, down 1%, driven 
by a decline in industry-wide fees despite wallet share 
gains.

•  Treasury Services revenue was $4.6 billion, down 3%, 
driven by deposit margin compression predominantly 
offset by higher balances and fee growth.

•  Lending revenue was $1.3 billion, up 3%, with higher net 

interest income largely offset by losses on hedges of 
accrual loans.

66

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.2 billion, up 
7%. Markets revenue was $20.9 billion, up 7% which 
included a gain on the IPO of Tradeweb in the second 
quarter of 2019. Prior year results included approximately 
$500 million of fair value gains recorded in the first quarter 
of 2018 related to the adoption of the recognition and 
measurement accounting guidance for certain equity 
investments previously held at cost.

•  Fixed Income Markets revenue was $14.4 billion, up 

13%, reflecting an overall strong performance, notably in 
Securitized Products. The increase in 2019 also reflected 
the impact of challenging market conditions in Credit and 
Rates in the fourth quarter of 2018.

•  Equity Markets revenue was $6.5 billion, down 6%, 

compared to a strong prior year, driven by lower client 
activity in derivatives partially offset by higher client 
activity in Cash Equities.

•  Securities Services revenue was $4.2 billion, down 2%, 
driven by deposit margin compression and the impact of 
a business exit largely offset by organic growth.

•  Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $121 million 

reflecting tighter funding spreads on derivatives, 
compared with a loss of $373 million in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was $277 million, compared 
with a $60 million net benefit in the prior year. This 
increase reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses 
in the current year on select client downgrades, and a 
benefit related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio 
and higher recoveries, both in the prior year.   

Noninterest expense was $21.5 billion, up 3%, 
predominantly driven by higher volume-related expenses 
and investments, including front office and technology staff 
hires, as well as higher legal expense, partially offset by 
lower FDIC charges.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 
recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 
and 7 for a description of the composition of these income 
statement line items. 

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from 
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions 
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new 
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-
related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains 
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the 
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, 

client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue 
recognized upon executing new transactions with market 
participants is driven by many factors including the level of 
client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference 
between the price at which a market participant is willing 
and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at 
which another market participant is willing and able to buy 
it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and 
volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the 
same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which 
include general market conditions, such as interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and 
commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic 
conditions.  

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

2019 compared with 2018 
Net income was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 7%.

Net revenue was $9.0 billion, a decrease of 1%. Net 
interest income was $6.6 billion, a decrease of 2%, 
predominantly driven by lower deposit margins. Noninterest 
revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 4%, driven by 
higher investment banking revenue, predominantly due to 
increased equity underwriting and M&A activity, and growth 
in lending and deposit related fees. 

Noninterest expense was $3.5 billion, an increase of 3%, 
driven by continued investments in the business, largely 
offset by lower FDIC charges. 

The provision for credit losses was $296 million, up from 
$129 million in the prior year. The increase in the provision  
reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses on select 
client downgrades in the current year and higher recoveries 
in the prior year.

solutions, including lending, treasury services,

Management’s discussion and analysis

CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which 
are primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral 
includes receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate or 
other assets. Products include term loans, revolving lines of 
credit, bridge financing, asset-based structures, leases, and 
standby letters of credit.

Treasury services includes revenue from a broad range of 
products and services that enable CB clients to manage 
payments and receipts, as well as invest and manage funds.

Investment banking includes revenue from a range of 
products providing CB clients with sophisticated capital-
raising alternatives, as well as balance sheet and risk 
management tools through advisory, equity underwriting, 
and loan syndications. Revenue from Fixed Income and 
Equity Markets products used by CB clients is also included. 

Other product revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent 
adjustments generated from Community Development 
Banking activities and certain income derived from principal 
transactions.

2019 compared with 2018 
Net income was $2.8 billion, a decrease of 1%.

Net revenue was $14.3 billion, an increase of 2%. Net 
interest income was $3.5 billion, down 1%, driven by 
deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by loan 
and deposit growth. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, 
up 3%, driven by higher net investment valuation gains and 
growth in fees on higher average market levels, partially 
offset by a shift in the mix toward lower fee products. 

Revenue from Asset Management was $7.3 billion, up 1%,  
driven by higher investment valuation gains. The impact on 
fees from higher average market levels was more than 
offset by a shift in the mix toward lower fee products. 

Revenue from Wealth Management was $7.1 billion, up 2%, 
driven by loan and deposit growth, growth in fees on the 
cumulative impact of net inflows and higher average market 
levels and brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit 
margin compression.

The provision for credit losses was $61 million, up from 
$53 million in the prior year, reflecting higher net-charge 
offs, as well as net additions to the allowance for loan 
losses, predominantly due to loan growth. 

Noninterest expense was $10.5 billion, an increase of 2%, 
predominantly driven by investments in the business as well 
as volume- and revenue-related expenses.

AWM’s lines of business consist of the following:

Asset Management provides comprehensive global investment 
services, including asset management, pension analytics, asset-liability 
management and active risk-budgeting strategies.

Wealth Management offers investment advice and wealth 
management, including investment management, capital markets and 
risk management, tax and estate planning, banking, lending and 
specialty-wealth advisory services.

AWM’s client segments consist of the following:
Private Banking clients include high- and ultra-high-net-worth 
individuals, families, money managers, business owners and small 
corporations worldwide.

Institutional clients include both corporate and public institutions, 
endowments, foundations, nonprofit organizations and governments 
worldwide.

Retail clients include financial intermediaries and individual investors.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 

rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on 
their risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating 
is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The 
“overall Morningstar rating” is derived from a weighted average of the 
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, 
separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The 
Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted 
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are 
not rated and hence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the 
assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this 
analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers mentioned in 
footnote (a). The data providers re-denominate the asset values into 
U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class 
level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where 
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The “primary share class”, 
as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as 
being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the 
most retail version (based upon annual management charge, 
minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance 
data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been 
included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 
ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years): All 
quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values 
used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking 
providers mentioned in footnote (b). Quartile rankings are done on 
the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-
denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based 
on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class 
level for U.S. domiciled funds and at the “primary share class” level or 
fund level for all other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by 
Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best 
proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail 
version (based upon annual management charge, minimum 
investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings 
given for a fund are in more than one “primary share class” territory 
both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness. 
The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts 
would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

2019 compared with 2018 
Net Income was $1.1 billion compared with a net loss of 
$1.2 billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $1.2 billion, compared with a net loss of 
$128 million in the prior year driven by higher net interest 
income and noninterest revenue. The increase in net 
interest income was driven by balance sheet growth and 
changes in mix, and also includes income related to the 
unwind of the internal funding provided to CCB upon the 
sale of certain mortgage loans. The income reflects the net 
present value of that funding and is recognized as a charge 
to net interest income in CCB. Refer to CCB on pages 62–65 
and FTP on page 61 of this Form 10-K for further 
information.

Noninterest revenue increased reflecting:
•  investment securities gains, compared with losses in the 
prior year, due to the repositioning of the investment 
securities portfolio, and

•  lower net markdowns on certain legacy private equity 

investments,
partially offset by
•  market-driven impacts on certain Corporate investments, 

and

•  higher losses on cash deployment transactions which 

were more than offset by the related net interest income 
earned on those transactions.

Noninterest expense of $1.1 billion was up $165 million 
reflecting higher investments in technology and real estate, 
and higher pension costs due to changes to actuarial  
assumptions and estimates.

The prior year included a pre-tax loss of $174 million on 
the liquidation of a legal entity.

The current period included $1.1 billion of tax benefits 
related to the resolution of certain tax audits. The prior year 
expense reflected a net benefit of $302 million resulting 
from changes in estimates under the TCJA related to the 
remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed 
repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings, which was more than 
offset by changes to certain tax reserves and other tax 
adjustments.

CORPORATE

The Corporate segment consists of Treasury and Chief
Investment Office and Other Corporate, which includes
corporate staff functions and expense that is centrally
managed. Treasury and CIO is predominantly
responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and
managing the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital,
structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The
major Other Corporate functions include Real Estate,
Technology, Legal, Corporate Finance, Human
Resources, Internal Audit, Risk Management,
Compliance, Control Management, Corporate
Responsibility and various Other Corporate groups.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s 
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and 
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four 
major reportable business segments to serve their 
respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-
balance sheet assets and liabilities.

Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability 
management objectives generally by investing in high-
quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as 
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury 
and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm’s asset-
liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further 
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO 
manage the Firm’s cash position primarily through deposits 
at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 for 
further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to 
Market Risk Management on pages 119–126 for 
information on interest rate, foreign exchange and other 
risks.

The investment securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. 
GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-
backed securities, U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, 
obligations of U.S. states and municipalities, other ABS and 
corporate debt securities. At December 31, 2019, the 
investment securities portfolio was $396.4 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and, where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 10 for further 
information on the investment securities portfolio and 
internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things:  

•  Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the 
Firm;  

•  Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; 
and  

•  Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to 
enhance controls, ongoing employee training and 
development, talent retention, and other measures. The 
Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks. 

Drivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers 
of risks include the economic environment, regulatory and 
government policy, competitor and market evolution, 
business decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate 
wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.   

Types of Risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. Risks are generally categorized in the following 
four risk types: 

•  Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 

•  Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 

default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, including 
consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and 
investment portfolio risk. 

•  Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 

changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and 
liabilities held for both the short and long term. 

•  Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse 
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model 
risk.

Impacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both 
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many 
consequences of risks manifesting, such as a reduction in 
earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or 
penalties, or qualitative impacts such as reputation 
damage, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and 
enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is 
managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent 
Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the 
Risk Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by 
the Risk Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”), 
the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM 
organization and manage the risk governance structure of 
the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board 
Risk Committee in the form of the primary risk management 
policies. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authorities 
to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), and the 
Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who each establish 
Risk Management and Compliance organizations, set the 
Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define 
and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk 
governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks that 
arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span 
across the individual LOB, functions and regions. 

Three lines of defense
The Firm relies upon each of its LOBs and Corporate areas 
giving rise to risk to operate within the parameters 
identified by the IRM function, and within its own 
management-identified risk and control standards. Each 
LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned Operations, 
Technology and Control Management are the Firm’s “first 
line of defense” and own the identification of risks, as well 
as the design and execution of controls to manage those 
risks. The first line of defense is responsible for adherence 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

79

Management’s discussion and analysis

to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the 
implementation of the risk management structure (which 
may include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and 
controls) established by IRM. 

The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is 
the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function sets 
and oversees the risk management structure for Firmwide 
risk governance, and independently assesses and challenges 
the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is 
also responsible for its own adherence to applicable laws, 
rules and regulations and for the implementation of policies 
and standards established by IRM with respect to its own 
processes. 

The Internal Audit function operates independently from 
other parts of the Firm and performs independent testing 
and evaluation of processes and controls across the Firm as 
the “third line of defense.” The Internal Audit Function is 
headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit 
Committee and administratively to the CEO. 

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the 
Firmwide control environment including Finance, Human 
Resources, Legal and Control Management. 

Risk identification and ownership
Each LOB and Corporate area owns the ongoing 
identification of risks, as well as the design and execution of 
controls, inclusive of IRM-specified controls, to manage 
those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk 
identification process designed to facilitate their 
responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm, 
catalog them in a central repository and review the most 
material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews 
and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identification of 
risks, maintains the central repository and provides the 
consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk 
Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk Committee. 

Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by a “Risk 
Appetite” framework. The framework and the Firm’s risk 
appetite are set and approved by the Firm’s CEO, Chief 
Financial Officer (“CFO”) and CRO. Quantitative parameters 
and qualitative factors are used to monitor and measure the 
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk 
appetite. Qualitative factors have been established to assess 
select operational risks that impact the Firm’s reputation. 
Risk Appetite results are reported to the Board Risk 
Committee.

80

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to 
senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

The chart below illustrates the Board of Directors’ and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance 
structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the oversight of risk which are 
not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K. 

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, CFO and other senior executives, is 
accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for 
escalating to the Board the information necessary to 
facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.

Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors provides oversight of risk. The 
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment, and the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee oversees compensation and other 
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board 
oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its 
scope of responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank. 
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this 
function acting directly and through the principal standing 
committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and 
control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is 
primarily the responsibility of the Risk Committee and the 
Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to 
compensation and other management-related matters, the 
Compensation & Management Development Committee.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Management’s discussion and analysis

The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk 
management framework reasonably designed to identify, 
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk 
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable 
primary risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, 
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, 
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant 
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk 
Committee, as appropriate.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of 
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an 
effective system of controls reasonably designed to 
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity 
of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance 
with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and 
procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also assists 
the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s independent 
registered public accounting firm’s qualifications, 
independence and performance, and of the performance of 
the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

The Compensation & Management Development Committee 
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s 
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews 
and approves the Firm’s compensation and benefits 
programs. In addition, the Committee reviews Operating 
Committee members’ performance against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. The CMDC also 
reviews the development of and succession for key 
executives, and provides oversight of the Firm’s culture, 
including reviewing updates from management regarding 
significant conduct issues and any related employee 
actions, including compensation actions.

The Public Responsibility Committee assists the Board in its 
oversight of the Firm's positions and practices on public 
responsibility matters such as community investment, fair 
lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public 
policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character 
and could impact the Firm's reputation among all of its 
stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on 
these matters to management and the Board, as 
appropriate.

The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance 
of the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to 
the Board corporate governance practices applicable to the 
Firm. It also appraises the framework for assessing the 
Board’s performance and self-evaluation. 

Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are 
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:

The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest 
management-level risk committee. It provides oversight of 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s businesses and serves as an 
escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by 
underlying committees and/or FRC members.

The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation 
committee for senior management to review and discuss 
the Firmwide operational risk environment including 
identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant 
events that have been escalated. 

The Firmwide Fiduciary Risk Governance Committee 
(“FFRGC”) provides oversight of the governance framework 
for fiduciary risk or fiduciary-related conflict of interest risk 
inherent in each of the Firm’s LOBs. The FFRGC approves 
risk or compliance policy exceptions and reviews periodic 
reports from the LOBs and control functions including 
fiduciary metrics and control trends. 

The Firmwide Estimations Risk Committee (“FERC”) provides 
oversight of the governance framework for quantitative and 
qualitative estimations and models as specified in the 
Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The FERC 
also has responsibility to set the prioritization of 
estimations and model risk activities and drive consistency 
through review of LOB activities and escalated issues. 

The Conduct Risk Steering Committee (“CRSC”) is responsible 
for reviewing, calibrating and consolidating Firmwide 
Conduct Risk Appetite and setting overall direction for the 
Firm’s Conduct Risk Program. 

Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for providing oversight of the governance,

Management’s discussion and analysis

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 

Management and oversight
The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each 
LOB and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s 
most significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen 
by IRM through participation in business reviews, LOB and 
Corporate senior management committees and other 
relevant governance forums and ongoing discussions. The 
Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic 
decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and 
the Firm’s risk management framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic 
initiatives, LOB and Corporate leadership identify the 
associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide 
Risk Identification process and monitored and assessed as 
part of the Firmwide Risk Appetite framework. 

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the 
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their 
impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the 
development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one 
component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by 
the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”), 
the Operating Committee and management teams in each 
LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic plan 
periodically. The process includes evaluating the high-level 
strategic framework and performance against prior-year 
initiatives, assessing the operating environment, refining 
existing strategies and developing new strategies.

These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are 
incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the Board 
for review.  

The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-
adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also 
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to 
Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 for further 
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 93–98 for further information on 
liquidity risk. In addition, for further information on 
reputation risk, refer to Reputation Risk Management on 
page 99.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business 
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong 
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is 
considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s 
fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted 
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s 
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining 
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in 
market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed 
environments. Senior management considers the 
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making any 
significant decisions that could impact future business 
activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings 
outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses 
of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital 
strength.

Capital management oversight
The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
assessment, measuring, monitoring and control of capital 
risk across the Firm.  

Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:

•  Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

•  Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk 
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;

•  Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 

limit breaches; and

•  Performing an independent assessment of the Firm’s 

capital management activities, including changes made 
to the contingency capital plan described below.

In addition, the Basel Independent Review function (“BIR”), 
which is a part of the IRM function, conducts independent 
assessments of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework. 
These assessments are intended to ensure compliance with 
the applicable regulatory capital rules in support of senior 
management’s responsibility for managing capital and for 
the Board Risk Committee’s oversight of management in 
executing that responsibility.

Capital management
Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.  

The primary objectives of effective capital management are 
to:

•  Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build 

and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and 
in stressed environments;

•  Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment 

opportunities;

•  Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of 

strength to its subsidiaries;

•  Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory 

capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” 
status for the Firm and its insured depository institution 
(“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable 
regulatory capital requirements;

•  Meet capital distribution objectives; and

•  Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 

throughout a resolution period in accordance with the 
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through establishing 
internal minimum capital requirements and a strong capital 
management governance framework, both in business as 
usual conditions and in the event of stress. 

Capital risk management is intended to be flexible in order 
to react to a range of potential events. In its management of 
capital, the Firm takes into consideration economic risk and 
all applicable regulatory capital requirements to determine 
the level of capital needed.

The Firm considers regulatory capital requirements as well 
as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal 
economic cycles and in stress events, when setting its 
minimum capital levels. The capital governance framework 
requires regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital positions, 
stress testing and defining escalation protocols, both at the 
Firm and material legal entity levels.

Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital 
management include the Capital Governance Committee, 
the Treasurer Committee and the Firmwide ALCO. Capital 
management oversight is governed through the CIO, 
Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) risk committee. In addition, 
the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s 
capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management 
on pages 79–83 for additional discussion on the Board Risk 
Committee and the ALCO.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding 
companies, including the Firm, to submit on an annual basis 
a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and 
other stress testing processes to ensure that large bank 
holding companies (“BHC”) have sufficient capital during 
periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, 
forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes 
in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to 
absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, 
the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy 
and internal capital adequacy assessment processes 
(“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, 
such as dividend payments or stock repurchases.

balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, 
weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, 
the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the 
fully phased-in measures under Basel III and represents the 
lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches. During 
2018, the required capital measures were subject to the 
transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 the results 
were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional 
basis. 

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating 
credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of 
Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in 
the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized 
and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, 
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which 
largely rely on the use of internal credit models and 
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk 
RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings 
which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. 
Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent 
basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these 
approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to 
incorporate management judgment and feedback from its 
regulators. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 90 for additional 
information.

Key Regulatory Developments 
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial 
Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”) guidance under U.S. 
GAAP. As provided by the U.S. banking agencies, the Firm 
elected to phase-in the impact to retained earnings of $2.7 
billion to regulatory capital, at 25 percent per year in each 
of 2020 to 2023 (“CECL transitional period”). Based on the 
Firm’s capital as of December 31, 2019, the estimated 
impact to the Standardized CET1 capital ratio will be a 
reduction of approximately 4 bps for each transitional year. 
Refer to Accounting and Reporting Developments on pages 
139-140 and Note 1 for further information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm 
that it did not object to the Firm’s 2019 capital plan. Refer 
to Capital actions on pages 90-91 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 
2019 CCAR results.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the 
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s 
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as 
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital 
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates 
stress testing protocols with capital planning.

The CCAR and other stress testing processes assess the 
potential impact of alternative economic and business 
scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic 
scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, 
are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the 
businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business 
results; global market shocks, which generate short-term 
but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk 
events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress 
key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. 
However, when defining a broad range of scenarios, actual 
events can always be worse. Accordingly, management 
considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as 
necessary. These results are reviewed by management and 
the Board of Directors. 

Contingency capital plan
The Firm’s contingency capital plan establishes the capital 
management framework for the Firm and specifies the 
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital 
management in normal economic conditions and during 
stress. The contingency capital plan defines how the Firm 
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum 
capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness 
of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital 
contingency actions that are expected to be taken or 
considered at various levels of capital depletion during a 
period of stress.

Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated 
financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital 
requirements for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements 
generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, 
as amended from time to time. 

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the 
Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Minimums
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III minimum CET1 capital ratio during the Basel III transitional periods and on a 
fully phased-in basis under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-
based ratios, and the Firm expects that this will remain the 
case for the foreseeable future.

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as 
well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to 
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to 
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, 
which are available on the Firm’s website, for further 
information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, 
are also required to hold additional amounts of capital to 
serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital 
conservation buffer is intended to be used to absorb losses 
in times of financial or economic stress. The capital 
conservation buffer was subject to a phase-in period that 
began January 1, 2016 and continued through the end of 
2018. 

As an expansion of the capital conservation buffer, the Firm 
is also required to hold additional levels of capital in the 
form of a global systemically important bank (“GSIB”) 
surcharge and a countercyclical capital buffer. 

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required 
to calculate its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two 
separately prescribed methods, and is subject to the higher 
of the two. The first (“Method 1”), reflects the GSIB 
surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s 
assessment methodology, and is calculated across five 
criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. The 
second (“Method 2”), modifies the Method 1 requirements 
to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in 
place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score 

“multiplication factor”. The following table presents the 
Firm’s GSIB surcharge.

2019

Fully Phased-In:

N/A

increments) through the end of 2018.

2.50%

3.50%

2.625%

The Firm’s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge 
calculated under Method 2 remains unchanged at 3.5% for 
2020.

The Federal Reserve's framework for setting the 
countercyclical capital buffer takes into account the macro 
financial environment in which large, internationally active 
banks function. As of December 31, 2019, the U.S. 
countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal 
Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. 
The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and 
OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above 
normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of 
RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. 

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess 
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the 
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) 
and any countercyclical buffer may result in limitations to 
the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as 
through dividends and common equity repurchases.

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Minimums

Supplementary leverage ratio
The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided 
by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage 
exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-
balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be

Management’s discussion and analysis

deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance 
sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and 
derivatives potential future exposure. 

Failure to maintain an SLR ratio equal to or greater than the 
regulatory minimum may result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common equity repurchases.

Other regulatory capital

In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must 
maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) 
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), 
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

Line of business equity
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance. 

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, leverage, the 
GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe 
stress environment. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.  The 
Firm will assess impacts from any regulatory changes to the 
capital framework as changes are finalized.   

The table below presents the Firm’s assessed level of capital 
allocated to each LOB as of the dates indicated.

The Firm from time to time enters into written trading plans 
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common 
equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan 
allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods 
when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common equity 
— for example, during internal trading blackout periods. 

The authorization to repurchase common equity is utilized 
at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases 
and the exact amount of common equity that may be 
repurchased is subject to various factors, including market 
conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the 
amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital 
position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); 
internal capital generation; and alternative investment 
opportunities. The repurchase program does not include 
specific price targets or timetables; may be executed 
through open market purchases or privately negotiated 
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans; and may be 
suspended by management at any time.

Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common 
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of 
Equity Securities on page 30 of the 2019 Form 10-K for 
additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s 
equity securities.

Other capital requirements
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (“TLAC”)
Effective January 1, 2019, the Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule 
requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including 
JPMorgan Chase & Co., to maintain minimum levels of 
external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”).

(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced.

Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers may result in 
limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may 
distribute, such as through dividends and common equity 
repurchases.

Broker-dealer regulatory capital

J.P. Morgan Securities
JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is 
J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to 
Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also 
registered as a futures commission merchant and subject to 
the Rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(“CFTC”).

J.P. Morgan Securities has elected to compute its minimum 
net capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative 
Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital Rule.

The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities’ net 
capital:

In addition to its alternative minimum net capital 
requirements, J.P. Morgan Securities is required to hold 
“tentative net capital” in excess of $1.0 billion and is also 
required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net 
capital is less than $5.0 billion. Tentative net capital is net 
capital before deducting market and credit risk charges as 
defined by the Net Capital Rule. As of December 31, 2019, 
J.P. Morgan Securities maintained tentative net capital in 
excess of the minimum and notification requirements. 

J.P. Morgan Securities plc
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and has authority to engage in 
banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. 
J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. 
Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial 
Conduct Authority (“FCA”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is 
subject to the European Union Capital Requirements 
Regulation and the PRA capital rules, each of which 
implemented Basel III and thereby subject J.P. Morgan 
Securities plc to its requirements.

The Bank of England requires, on a transitional basis, that 
U.K. banks, including U.K. regulated subsidiaries of overseas 
groups, maintain a minimum requirement for own funds 
and eligible liabilities (“MREL”). As of December 31, 2019, 
J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with the 
requirements of the MREL rule.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. 

Liquidity risk oversight
The Firm has a liquidity risk oversight function whose 
primary objective is to provide independent assessment, 
measurement, monitoring, and control of liquidity risk 
across the Firm. Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities 
include: 

•  Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics; 

•  Establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, 

including Liquidity Risk Appetite; 

•  Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 

limit breaches; 

•  Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 

management processes;  

•  Monitoring and reporting internal firmwide and legal 

entity liquidity stress tests as well as regulatory defined 
liquidity stress tests; 

•  Approving or escalating for review new or updated 

liquidity stress assumptions; and 

•  Monitoring liquidity positions, balance sheet variances 

and funding activities; 

Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management. 
The primary objectives of effective liquidity management 
are to:  

•  Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal 
entities are able to operate in support of client needs 
and meet contractual and contingent financial 
obligations through normal economic cycles as well as 
during stress events, and 

•  Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 

liquidity sources. 

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, 
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach in order to:  

• 

Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 

•  Monitor exposures; 

• 

Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between 
the Firm’s legal entities; and   

•  Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at 
a firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 

In the context of the Firm’s liquidity management, Treasury 
and CIO is responsible for: 

•  Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics 
of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal 
entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and 
operational restrictions; 

•  Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; 

•  Defining and monitoring firmwide and legal entity-
specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 

•  Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity 

risk appetite tolerances and limits; 

•  Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 

related to funding and liquidity risk; and 

•  Setting transfer pricing in accordance with underlying 
liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and 
liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items. 

Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the 
firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the 
Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and 
recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, 
the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and 
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on 
pages 79–83 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-
related committees. 

Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm 
has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, 
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution 
and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s 
material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress 
tests are performed in response to specific market events or 
concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s 
contractual financial obligations are met and take into 
consideration: 

•  Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 

funding markets, 

•  Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows, 

and 

•  Potential impediments to the availability and 

transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other 
restrictions. 

Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range 
of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate 
both market and idiosyncratic stresses. 

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of 
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity 
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding 
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, 
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides funding support to the 
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent 
Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient 
to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended December 31, 2019, compared with both the three-
month periods ended September 30, 2019 and December 
31, 2018, due to an increase in HQLA from unsecured long-
term debt issuances. Additionally, liquidity in JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the fourth quarter and 
from the prior year period primarily due to growth in stable 
deposits. This increase in excess liquidity is excluded from 
the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, 
due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows 
as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s 
U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, 
the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as 
equity securities and fixed income debt securities, that the 
Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity of 
approximately $315 billion and $226 billion as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This includes 
securities included as part of the excess liquidity at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-
bank affiliates, as described above. The amount of such 
securities increased from the prior year.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs 
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a 
result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $322 billion and $276 billion as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Bank discount window and other central banks. Available 
borrowing capacity increased from the prior year primarily 
as a result of an increase in collateral available to be 
pledged as a result of the merger of Chase Bank USA, N.A. 
with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and an increase 
in available collateral as a result of maturities of borrowings 
from FHLBs. Although available, the Firm does not view this 
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount 
window and the other central banks as a primary source of 
liquidity. 

Management’s discussion and analysis

liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of 
stress when access to normal funding sources may be 
disrupted.

Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s contingency funding plan (“CFP”), which is 
approved by the firmwide ALCO and the Board Risk 
Committee, is a compilation of procedures and action plans 
for managing liquidity through stress events. The CFP 
incorporates the limits and indicators set by the Liquidity 
Risk Oversight group. These limits and indicators are 
reviewed regularly to identify emerging risks or 
vulnerabilities in the Firm’s liquidity position. The CFP 
identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity 
resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a 
period of stress.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio
The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of 
unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) that is 
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over 
a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. 
HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for 
inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of 
unencumbered cash and certain high-quality liquid 
securities as defined in the LCR rule. 

Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% 
minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to 
non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s 
reported HQLA.  

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized 
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, 
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, 
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR is required to be 
a minimum of 100%. 

The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for 
the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 
30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 based on the Firm’s 
interpretation of the finalized LCR framework.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured 
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance 
sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
may also access funding through short- or long-term secured 

borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term 
debt, or from borrowings from the Parent company or the 
IHC. The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded 
from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term 
secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by 
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio 
or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments 
based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. 

Deposits

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than period-
end deposit balances. 

Average deposits across the Firm increased for the year 
ended December 31, 2019. 

The increase in CIB reflects growth in operating deposits 
driven by client activity, primarily in Treasury Services, and 
an increase in client-driven net issuances of structured notes 
in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by continued 
growth in new accounts. The increases in AWM and CB were 
primarily driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits; for 
AWM, the growth was partially offset by migration, 
predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment 
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including government-
issued debt, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 
were relatively flat at December 31, 2019, compared with 
December 31, 2018, as the net increase from the Firm’s 
participation in the Federal Reserve’s open market 
operations was offset by client-driven activities, and lower 
secured financing of trading assets-debt instruments, all in 
CIB.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial 
paper. The decrease in commercial paper at December 31, 
2019, from December 31, 2018, was due to lower net 
issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.  

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable 
funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, 
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, 
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include 
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various 
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its 
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding 
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes 
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Note

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,

which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third- party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. 

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019, 
were as follows.

credit rating for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. reflects the credit rating of the merged entity.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings 
or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable 
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, 
earnings, or stock price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a 
stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and 

liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management 
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies 
continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, 
regulatory developments, future profitability, risk 
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as 
their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes 
the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is 
the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate 
to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding 
whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or 
client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a 
business process or other matters. Increasingly, 
sustainability, social responsibility and environmental 
impacts are important considerations in assessing the 
Firm’s reputation risk, and are considered as part of 
reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues deemed material are escalated as 
appropriate. 

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may 
negatively impact the Firm’s integrity and reduce 
confidence in the Firm’s competence held by various 
constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, 
investors, regulators, employees, communities or the 
broader public.

Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm. As 
reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, 
and quantify, an independent reputation risk management 
governance function is critical.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes 
the following activities:
• 

Establishing a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and standards consistent with the reputation risk 
framework 

•  Managing the governance infrastructure and processes 
that support consistent identification, escalation, 
management and monitoring of reputation risk issues 
Firmwide

• 

Providing guidance to LOB Reputation Risk Offices 
(“RRO”), as appropriate 

The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are 
broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by 
the Firm’s employees and the clients, customers and 
counterparties with which the Firm does business. These 
events could result in financial losses, litigation and 
regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The 
Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from 
large corporate and institutional clients to individual 
consumers and small businesses. In its consumer 
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily 
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business 
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients 
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services 
activities (such as cash management and clearing 
activities), securities financing activities, investment 
securities portfolio, and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that monitors, measures and 
manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit 
risk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk 
management governance includes the following activities:

•  Establishing a credit risk policy framework

•  Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all 
portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure 
approval

•  Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as 
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines 

•  Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection 

with the approval of credit exposure

•  Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans

•  Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit 

risk-based capital management

Risk identification and measurement
The Credit Risk Management function monitors, measures, 
manages and limits credit risk across the Firm’s businesses. 
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or 
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit 
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of 
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement 
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit 
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management 
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus 
centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk 
measurement is based on the probability of default of an 
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default 
event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates 
described in Note 13, the Firm estimates credit losses for its 
exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects credit 
losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-
investment loan portfolios, and the allowance for lending-
related commitments reflects credit losses related to the 
Firm’s lending-related commitments. Refer to Note 13 and 
Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 
136-138 for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to 
the established allowances for loan losses and lending-
related commitments. The analyses for these losses include 
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios 
as described in the Stress testing section below.

Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The process 
assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and 
business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. 
Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are 
defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic 
factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test 
results may indicate credit migration, changes in 
delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit 
portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional stresses 
outside these scenarios, including industry and country- 
specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress 
testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a 
Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress 
on individual counterparties.

100

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent 
Credit Review function is responsible for: 

•  Independently validating or changing the risk grades 
assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale and 
commercial-oriented retail credit portfolios, and 
assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by 
responsible business units; and 

•  Evaluating the effectiveness of business units’ credit 

management processes, including the adequacy of credit 
analyses and risk grading/LGD rationales, proper 
monitoring and management of credit exposures, and 
compliance with applicable grading policies and 
underwriting guidelines. 

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and 
wholesale loans.

Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-
making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, 
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported 
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. 
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, 
counterparties and customers, product and geography are 
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on 
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and 
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions 
are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk 
committees, senior management and the Board of Directors 
as appropriate.

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the 
approval and decision-making process of extending credit to 
ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved 
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both 
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework 
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, 
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in 
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently 
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other 
trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, 
as certain of these trends can be modified through changes 
in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer 
Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends 
against business expectations, current and forecasted 
economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical 
and forecasted economic performance and trends are 
incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer 
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit 
risk profile of the portfolio. 

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate 
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty 
level with established concentration limits that are reviewed 
and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by 
management. Industry and counterparty limits, as 
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, 
are subject to stress-based loss constraints. In addition, 
wrong-way risk, that is the risk that exposure to a 
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a 
default by the same counterparty, which could cause 
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing - is actively 
monitored as this risk could result in greater exposure at 
default compared with a transaction with another 
counterparty that does not have this risk. 

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is 
accomplished through a number of means, including:

•  Loan underwriting and credit approval process

•  Loan syndications and participations

•  Loan sales and securitizations

•  Credit derivatives

•  Master netting agreements

•  Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

(b)  Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied for determining the allowance for loan 

losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included within the consumer portfolio. 

(c)  Predominantly includes Business Banking loans.
(d)  Credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and 
does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home 
equity commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without 
notice. Refer to Note 28 for further information.

(e)  Includes billed interest and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible interest and fees.
(f)  At December 31, 2019 and 2018, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $961 
million and $2.6 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the 
Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC.

(g)  Excludes PCI loans. The Firm is recognizing interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools is performing.
(h)  Net charge-offs/(recoveries) and net charge-off/(recovery) rates excluded write-offs in the PCI portfolio of $151 million and $187 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These write-offs decreased the allowance for loan losses for PCI loans. Refer to Allowance for Credit 
Losses on pages 116–117 for further information.

(i)  Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $2.9 billion and $387 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts 

were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances decreased from December 31, 2018 due to 
lower residential real estate loans, predominantly driven by 
loan sales. 

The following discussions provide information concerning 
individual loan products, excluding PCI loans which are 
addressed separately. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit 
quality indicators.

Residential mortgage: The residential mortgage portfolio, 
including loans held-for-sale, predominantly consists of 
prime mortgage loans. The portfolio decreased from 
December 31, 2018 driven by paydowns as well as loan 
sales in Home Lending, largely offset by originations of 
prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the 
balance sheet. Net recoveries for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 were lower when compared with the 
prior year as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries 
on loan sales.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm’s residential 
mortgage portfolio included $22.4 billion and $21.6 billion, 
respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an 
interest-only payment period generally followed by an 
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 was consistent with the performance of 
the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same 
period.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale.
The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential 
unrecoverable claim payments related to government 
insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the 
allowance for loan losses.

Home equity: The home equity portfolio declined from 
December 31, 2018 primarily reflecting paydowns.

At December 31, 2019, approximately 90% of the Firm’s 
home equity portfolio consists of home equity lines of credit 

(“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity 
loans (“HELOANs”). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, 
closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3–30 
years. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are 
revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the 
HELOC recasts into a loan with a 20-year amortization 
period.

The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was $22 billion at 
December 31, 2019. This amount included $10 billion of 
HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully 
amortizing payments or have been modified and $3 billion 
of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature 
after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during 
their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn 
line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are 
exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk 
profile.

Auto: The auto portfolio predominantly consists of prime-
quality loans. The portfolio declined when compared with 
December 31, 2018, as paydowns and charge-offs or 
liquidation of delinquent loans were predominantly offset 
by new originations.

Consumer & Business Banking: Consumer & Business 
Banking loans increased when compared with 
December 31, 2018 as loan originations were 
predominantly offset by paydowns and charge-offs of 
delinquent loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended 
December 31, 2019 increased when compared with the 
prior year primarily due to higher deposit overdraft losses.

Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans represent 
certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-
impaired on the acquisition date. PCI loans decreased from 
December 31, 2018 due to portfolio run-off. As of 
December 31, 2019, approximately 9% of the option ARM 
PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 71% of the 
portfolio has been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing 
loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining 
option ARM loans are making amortizing payments, 
although such payments are not necessarily fully 
amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of 
payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates 
generally increase on option ARM loans when payment 
recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase 
in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly 
impairment assessment.

Refer to Note 12 for further information on the Firm’s PCI loans, including write-offs.

Geographic composition of residential real estate loans
At December 31, 2019, $142.7 billion, or 64% of the total 
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding 
mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and 
PCI loans, were concentrated in California, New York, 
Illinois, Texas and Florida, compared with $160.3 billion, or 
63%, at December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information on the geographic composition of the 
Firm’s residential real estate loans.

Current estimated loan-to-values of residential real 
estate loans
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios have 
declined consistent with recent improvements in home 
prices, customer pay-downs, and charge-offs or liquidations 
of higher LTV loans. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information on current estimated LTVs of residential real 
estate loans.

Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, relating to modified

accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back 
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform 
become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for additional

and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$41 million and $75 million, respectively. These amounts have been 
excluded based upon the government guarantee. 

(b)  Excludes PCI loans, which are accounted for on a pool basis. Since each 
pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest

Active and suspended foreclosure: Refer to Note 12 for 
information on loans that were in the process of active or 
suspended foreclosure.

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2018 
due to higher sales volume from existing customers and 
new account growth. Net charge-offs increased for the year 
ended December 31, 2019 when compared with the prior 
year, due to loan growth, in line with expectations.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset 
against loans and reduces interest income, for the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2019, $77.5 billion, or 46% of the total 
retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in 
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared 
with $71.2 billion, or 45%, at December 31, 2018. Refer to 
Note 12 for additional information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm had $1.5 billion 
and $1.3 billion, respectively, of credit card loans 
outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 
12 for additional information about loan modification 
programs for borrowers.

Management’s discussion and analysis

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-
making, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk.

The credit performance of the wholesale portfolio remained 
favorable for the year ended December 31, 2019, 
characterized by continued low levels of criticized exposure, 
nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 109–111 for further information. 
Loans held-for-sale decreased, driven by a loan syndication 
in CIB. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part 
by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit 
quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral 
where applicable, and of industry, product and client 
concentrations.

In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio 
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. It 
excludes all exposure managed by CCB, scored prime 
mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and 
scored prime mortgage loans held in Corporate.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 

categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, 
excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was 
$14.3 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $12.1 
billion at December 31, 2018. The increase was driven by 
select client downgrades.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire 
without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a 
result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual 
amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is  
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure 
or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further 
information on wholesale lending-related commitments.

Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers primarily represent held-for-
investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and 
AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the 
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such no 
allowance is held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.

Clearing services
The Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into 
certain securities and derivative contracts. Through the 
provision of these services the Firm is exposed to the risk of 
non-performance by its clients and may be required to 
share in losses incurred by CCPs. Where possible, the Firm 
seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the 
collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout 
the life of the transactions and can also cease the provision 
of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their 
obligations under the clearing agreement. Refer to Note 28  
for a further discussion of clearing services.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other 
market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and 
the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit 
risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the 
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 

counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter 
(“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm is generally exposed 
to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the 
Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from 
derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable 
master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. 
Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of derivative 
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The following table summarizes the net derivative 
receivables for the periods presented.

(a)  Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate 
legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to 
master netting agreements. 

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $49.8 billion and $54.2 
billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the 
derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable 
master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the 
Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate 
measure of current credit risk should also take into 
consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. 
government and agency securities and other group of seven 
nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash 
collateral held by the Firm aggregating $16.0 billion and 
$15.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively, that may be used as security when the fair 
value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. 

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the table above, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair 
value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit 
enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net 
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the 
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To 
capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, 
the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three 
measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, 
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

113

exposure to a counterparty (AVG) and the counterparty’s 
credit quality. Many factors may influence the nature and 
magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent 
that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust 
the CVA associated with that counterparty’s AVG. The Firm 
risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into 
credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three 
measures generally show that exposure will decline after 
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures
December 31, 2019
(in billions)

Management’s discussion and analysis

(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and 
collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is 
broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life 
of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the 
Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior 
management reporting and derivatives exposure 
management. 

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to 
the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of 
potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for 
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and 
other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the 
Firm’s derivative receivables at future time periods, 
including the benefit of collateral. AVG over the total life of 
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for 
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital 
and CVA, as further described below. 

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the 
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk 
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit 
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk 
management process takes into consideration the potential 
impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the 
potential for increased correlation between the Firm’s 

The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all 
collateral, at the dates indicated. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to 
mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the 
Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to 
collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot 
trades, which are not typically covered by collateral 
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally 
cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 
90% at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management” activities). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from 
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making 
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in 
credit portfolio management activities.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with 
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions 
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related 
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an 
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, 
between loans and lending-related commitments and the 
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in 
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge 
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the named reference entity 
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures 
that are different than the named reference entities in the 
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which 
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an 
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter 
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally 
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date 
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the 
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and 
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored 
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in 
Note 5 for a detailed description of credit derivatives.

Management’s discussion and analysis

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained 
consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the 
Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related 
commitments.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 136–138 and Note 13 for further information on the 
components of the allowance for credit losses and related 
management judgments.

At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is 
reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the 
Firm. As of December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase deemed 
the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and 
sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the 
portfolio.

The allowance for credit losses decreased compared with 
December 31, 2018 driven by:
•  an $800 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan 
losses, which included $650 million in the PCI residential 
real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in 
home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non 
credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 
million in the business banking portfolio; as well as 
•  a $151 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans, 
predominantly offset by 
•  a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in 

the credit card portfolio reflecting loan growth and  
higher loss rates as newer vintages season and become a 
larger part of the portfolio, and  

•  a $251 million addition in the wholesale allowance for 

credit losses driven by select client downgrades.

Note: In the table above, the financial measures which exclude the impact of PCI loans are non-GAAP financial measures. 

(a)  Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as 

purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool. 
(b)  Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance 
for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c)  The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d)  The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

Management’s discussion and analysis

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm's balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At December 31, 2019, 
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was 
$396.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the 
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon 
external ratings where available and where not available, 
based primarily upon internal risk ratings. Refer to 
Corporate segment results on pages 77–78 and Note 10 for 
further information on the investment securities portfolio 
and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management 
on pages 119–126 for further information on the market 
risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 93–98 for further information on 
related liquidity risk. 

Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk 
Committee with regular updates to the Board Risk 
Committee. 

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. 
Approved levels for investment securities are established 
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically private non-traded 
financial instruments representing ownership or other 
forms of junior capital. Principal investments span multiple 
asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business platform. In 
general, new principal investments include tax-oriented 
investments, as well as investments made to enhance or 
accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate 
carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were 
$24.2 billion and $22.2 billion, respectively, which included 
tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and 
alternative energy investments) of $18.2 billion and $16.6 
billion, respectively, and private equity, various debt and 
equity instruments, and real assets of $6.0 billion and $5.6 
billion, respectively.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk 
policy framework exists for all principal investing activities 
and includes approval by executives who are independent 
from the investing businesses, as appropriate. 

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of 
the risk governance structure, approved levels for 
investments are established and monitored for each 
relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall 
size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing 
on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate 
losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk 
events.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term.  

Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout 
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. 

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate 
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of 
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is 
responsible for the following functions:

•  Establishing a market risk policy framework

•  Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling 

LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

•  Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

•  Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments

Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, 
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
•  Value-at-risk (VaR) 
•  Stress testing
•  Profit and loss drawdowns 
•  Earnings-at-risk 
•  Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series 
of limits set in the context of the market environment and 
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk 
Management takes into consideration factors such as 
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client 
business, and management experience. Market Risk 
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level 
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and 
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such 
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within 
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.

Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews 
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is 
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these 
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been 
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk 
Management are escalated to senior management. The 
LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to 
established limits against which exposures are monitored 
and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of a 
breach, Market Risk Management consults with appropriate 
members of the Firm to determine the suitable course of 
action required to return the applicable positions to 
compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order 
to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in 
limits to accommodate an expected increase in client 
activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or 
LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give 
rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. 

In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the 
extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures (i.e., VaR or Other 
sensitivity-based measures) and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 118 for 
additional discussion on principal investments.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in 
the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR 
framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management 
VaR and Regulatory VaR.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical 
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The 
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in 
market values are representative of the distribution of 
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm 
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily 
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management 
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with 
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to 
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across 
product types and is used for aggregating risks and 
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are 
reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and 
regulators.  

Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, 
assuming current changes in market values are consistent 
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to incur VaR “back-testing exceptions,” 
defined as losses greater than that predicted by VaR 
estimates, an average of five times every 100 trading days. 
The number of VaR back-testing exceptions observed can 
differ from the statistically expected number of back-testing 
exceptions if the current level of market volatility is 
materially different from the level of market volatility 
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR 
calculation.

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual 
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for 
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture 
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are 
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to 
market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate 
numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes 
in market values over the historical period; inputs are 
selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as 
sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily 
market values may be different across product types or risk 
management systems. The VaR model results across all 
portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.

As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR 
measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure 
certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those 
associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe 
shifts in market conditions. 

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and 
availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses 
proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products 
when daily time series are not available. It is likely that 
using an actual price-based time series for these products, 
if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The 
Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such 
as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage 
its market risk positions. 

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different 
than the independent third-party data collected for VCG 
price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, 
in cases where market prices are not observable, or where 
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data 
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for 
further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR 
model calculations require daily data and a consistent 
source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data 
collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR 
model calculations. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques 
and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may 
affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to 
Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 for 
information regarding model reviews and approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in 
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which 
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital 
requirements under Basel III. This Regulatory VaR model 
framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding 
period and an expected tail loss methodology which 
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is 
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III, which 
may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s 
Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative 
hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk 
Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these 
credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently 
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory 

VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory 
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-
based measure and the respective backtesting).

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary 
significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a)  Average portfolio VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification 

effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated.

(b)  Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification 
benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for 
each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.

Average Total VaR increased $2 million for the year-ended 
December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior year. This 
was predominantly due to increased exposure in the Fixed 
Income risk type, increases in the Equities risk type driven 
by the inclusion of Tradeweb following its IPO in the second 
quarter of 2019, and increased volatility in the one-year 
historical look-back period, partially offset by increases in 
diversification benefit. 

In addition, average CCB VaR increased by $4 million, driven 
by MSR risk management activities.

VaR back-testing
The Firm performs daily VaR model back-testing, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the 
daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk 
related revenue.

The Firm’s definition, of market risk-related gains and losses 
is consistent with the definition used by the banking 
regulators under Basel III. Under this definition, market 
risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and 
losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk 
Management VaR excluding select components of revenue 
such as fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments, 
net interest income, and gains and losses arising from 
intraday trading.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to 
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market 
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from 
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive 
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures 
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed 
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results 
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 

The Firm’s stress framework covers Corporate and all LOBs 
with market risk sensitive positions. The framework is used 
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both 
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant 
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity 
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, 
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios.  

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail 
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including 
how the event may impact multiple market factors 
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific 
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different 
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the 
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes 
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results 
are reported on a regular basis to senior management of 
the Firm, as appropriate. 

Stress scenarios are governed by an overall stress 
framework and are subject to the standards outlined in the 
Firm’s policies related to model risk management. 
Significant changes to the framework are reviewed as 
appropriate.  

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating  
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are 
reported to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress 
testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite 
framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk 
Committee. 

Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading 
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and 
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date 
peak level.

Earnings-at-risk 
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension 
of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing 
debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. 
Refer to the table on page 120 for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural 
interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject 
to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, 
working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s 
structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior 
management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, 
oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through 
a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC. This risk 
function is responsible for providing independent oversight 
and governance around assumptions and establishing and 
monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm 
manages structural interest rate risk generally through its 
investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. 

Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of 
factors, including:

•  Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of 

assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

•  Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-

balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing 
at the same time

•  Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-
term market interest rates change (for example, changes 
in the slope of the yield curve)

•  The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, 
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest 
rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. 
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury 
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into 
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be 
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include 
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, 
contractual principal payment schedules, expected 
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and 
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest 
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. All 
transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of 
December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 
reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower short-
term and long-term rates as well as the impact of changes 
in the Firm’s balance sheet. The Firm’s sensitivity to short-
term rates reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower 
rates but changes in the Firm’s balance sheet more than 
offset the impacts of the lower rates. The Firm’s sensitivity 
to long-term rates increased as a result of updates to the 
Firm’s baseline to reflect lower rates in addition to changes 
in the Firm’s balance sheet. The increased sensitivity to 
long-term rates is more impactful to the downward scenario 
due to the Firm’s sensitivity to mortgage prepayments.

The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the 
table below.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario 
involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 
by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current 
levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at 
December 31, 2019 and 2018.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is 
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude 
other positions in risk management VaR and other 
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 120. 

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months, utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates or decreasing short-term rates 
and holding long-term rates constant; and a flatter yield 
curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding 
long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates 
constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios 
consider many different factors, including: 

•  The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates. 

•  Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate 
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based 
on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with 
underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, 
and other factors which are updated periodically based 
on historical experience.   

•  The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized 
deposit betas which represent the amount by which 
deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in 
market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates 
paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates 
paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to repricing lags 
and other factors. 

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other 
factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate 
exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a 
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to the 
2020 Outlook on page 45 for additional information).

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign 
exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or 
liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. 
dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, 
forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities 

portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. 
Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, 
primarily manage these risks on behalf of the 
Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks 
using derivatives. 

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net 
revenue and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the table Predominant 
business activities that give rise to market risk on page 120 for additional information on the positions captured in other 
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk sensitive instruments that are not 
included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are reported along with the 
positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the actual gain or loss that 
would have been realized at December 31, 2019 and 2018, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may 
vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
•  Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received

•  Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with 

central and commercial banks

•  Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
•  Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions

•  Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 

measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received

•  Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is 

reported based on the underlying reference entity and is 
measured at the notional amount of protection 
purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized 
derivative receivable or payable. Credit derivatives 
protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s market-
making activities is measured on a net basis, as such 
activities often result in selling and purchasing 
protection related to the same underlying reference 
entity; this reflects the manner in which the Firm 
manages these exposures

Some activities may create contingent or indirect exposure 
related to a country (for example, providing clearing 
services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities 
financing receivables). These exposures are managed in the 
normal course of business through the Firm’s credit, 
market, and operational risk governance, rather than 
through Country Risk Management.

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements. Refer to Cross-border outstandings on page 
306 of the 2019 Form 10-K for further information on the 
FFIEC’s reporting methodology.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses, manages and monitors 
country risk originated across the Firm. 

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the 
following activities:
•  Establishing policies, procedures and standards 

consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework
•  Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and 

establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

•  Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and 

stress across the Firm

•  Managing and approving country limits and reporting 
trends and limit breaches to senior management

•  Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models 

and ratings indicators, for early identification of 
potential country risk concerns

•  Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk 
management approach, attribution of exposure to a specific 
country is based on the country where the largest 
proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor 
or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of 
its revenue is derived, which may be different than the 
domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation of 
the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor. Country 
exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm’s 
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are 
sometimes required in determining the measurement and 
allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of 
certain non-linear or index exposures. The use of different 
measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the 
amount of reported country exposure.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by 
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to 
a country based on market shocks combined with 
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk 
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress 
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or  
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market 
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to  
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as 
necessary.

Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported 
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify 
trends, and monitor high usages and breaches against 
limits.  

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions 
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the 
independent sovereign states with which they are 
associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2019, and 
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2018. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country 
risk management approach, and does not represent the 
Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit 
conditions. 

Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due 
to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure 
in Japan is largely due to increased cash balances placed 
with the central bank of Japan, driven by client activity.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse 
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. 

Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable the 
Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. 

Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate hold ownership, responsibility and 
accountability for the management of operational risk. The 
Control Management Organization, which consists of control 
managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for 
the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework and the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of their control 
environments to determine where targeted remediation 
efforts may be required. 

LOBs and Corporate control committees are responsible for 
reviewing data that indicates the quality and stability of 
processes, addressing key operational risk issues, focusing 
on processes with control concerns, and overseeing control 
remediation.

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE 
for Operational Risk is responsible for defining the CCOR 
Management Framework and establishing minimum 
standards for its execution. Operational Risk Officers 
(“OROs”) report to both the LOB CROs and to the FRE for 
Operational Risk, and are independent of the respective 
businesses or functions they oversee.

The Firm’s CCOR Management policy establishes the CCOR 
Management Framework for the Firm. The CCOR 
Management Framework is articulated in the Risk 
Governance and Oversight Policy which is reviewed and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.

Operational Risk identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-
assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate 
evaluate the effectiveness of their control environment to 
assess where controls have failed, and to determine where 
remediation efforts may be required. CCOR Management 

provides oversight of these activities and may also perform 
independent assessments of significant operational risk 
events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement
CCOR Management performs independent risk assessments 
of the Firm’s operational risks, which includes assessing the 
effectiveness of the control environment and reporting the 
results to senior management.

In addition, operational risk measurement includes 
operational risk-based capital and operational risk loss 
projections under both baseline and stressed conditions. 

The primary component of the operational risk capital 
estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) 
statistical model, which simulates the frequency and 
severity of future operational risk loss projections based on 
historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an 
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time 
horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model 
incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the 
quarter following the period in which those losses were 
realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect 
such losses even after the issues or business activities 
giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s 
operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the 
Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates 
internal and external losses as well as management’s view 
of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario 
analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and 
internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the 
impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk 
capital. 

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk events 
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s 
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress 
testing processes. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management section, on pages 85–92 
for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by CCOR 
Management are leveraged as one of the key criteria in the 
independent monitoring and testing of the LOBs and 
Corporate’s compliance with laws and regulation. Through 
monitoring and testing, CCOR Management independently 
identifies areas of operational risk and tests the 
effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

129

Management’s discussion and analysis

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. CCOR Management 
may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and 
implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting
Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for 
employees at the Firm. Risks identified by CCOR 
Management are escalated to the appropriate LOB and 
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. CCOR 
Management has established standards to ensure that 
consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk 
reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by 
LOBs and Corporate.  Reporting includes the evaluation of 
key risk indicators and key performance indicators against 
established thresholds as well as the assessment of 
different types of operational risk against stated risk 
appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to 
senior management and to the Board of Directors.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to pages 132, 133, and 134, respectively 
for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and 
Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select 
examples of operational risks are provided below.

Cybersecurity risk 
Cybersecurity risk is an important, continuous and evolving 
focus for the Firm. The Firm devotes significant resources to 
protecting and continuing to improve the security of its 
computer systems, software, networks and other 
technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are designed 
to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity 
attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access 
to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or 
degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. 
The Firm continues to make significant investments in 
enhancing its cyberdefense capabilities and to strengthen 
its partnerships with the appropriate government and law 
enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to 
understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the 
operating environment, enhance defenses and improve 
resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively 
participates in discussions of cybersecurity risks with law 
enforcement, government officials, peer and industry 
groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate 
employees and certain clients on the topic. 

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, 
exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and 
financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity 

risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as 
system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the 
employees of such parties, or cyberattacks could affect 
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its 
clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the 
Firm, particularly when their activities and systems are 
beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. As a 
result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions 
with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity 
risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where 
cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to 
maintain the security of their own systems and processes, 
clients are responsible for losses incurred. 

To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the 
Firm maintains a cybersecurity program designed to 
prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Audit 
Committee is updated periodically on the Firm’s Information 
Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity 
policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, 
as well as its efforts regarding significant cybersecurity 
events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident 
response plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to 
respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate 
such responses with law enforcement and other 
government agencies, and notify clients and customers, as 
applicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is 
designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to 
a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation 
points.

The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are 
responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s 
Information Security Program. In partnership with the 
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and 
Technology Control organization identifies information 
security risk issues and oversees programs for the 
technological protection of the Firm’s information resources 
including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential 
and personal information related to the Firm’s customers. 
The Cybersecurity and Technology organization is 
comprised of business aligned information security 
managers that are supported within the organization by the 
following products that execute the Information Security 
Program for the Firm:

•  Cyber Defense & Fraud

•  Data Management, Protection & Privacy

• 

Identity & Access Management

•  Governance & Controls

•  Production Management & Resiliency

•  Software & Platform Enablement

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control 
governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and 
mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key 
governance forums to disseminate information and monitor

evaluated and enhanced in an effort to detect and mitigate 
new strategies implemented by fraud perpetrators.

Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates 
Oversight (“IAO”) framework assist the LOBs and Corporate 
in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and 
managing their supplier relationships including services 
provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework 
is to hold suppliers to a high level of operational 
performance and to mitigate key risks including data loss 
and business disruption. The Corporate Third-Party 
Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, 
monitoring, reporting and standards.

Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated 
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm 
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and 
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance 
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties 
with whom the Firm does business.

technology efforts. These forums are established at 
multiple levels throughout the Firm and include 
representatives from each LOB and Corporate. Reports 
containing overviews of key technology risks and efforts to 
enhance related controls are produced for these forums, 
and are reviewed by management at multiple levels. The 
forums are used to escalate information security risks or 
other matters as appropriate. 

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities 
designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate 
cybersecurity risk. 

The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training 
that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and 
Security Management policies, standards and practices, as 
well as the expectation that employees comply with these 
policies. The Security Awareness Program engages 
personnel through training on how to identify potential 
cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and 
information. This training is mandatory for all employees 
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by 
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing 
tests. Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all 
employees to take periodic awareness training on data 
privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information 
about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to 
unauthorized access to or use of information.

Business and technology resiliency risk 
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or 
telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party 
to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit 
strikes, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of 
infectious diseases or pandemics. The safety of the Firm’s 
employees and customers is of the highest priority. The 
Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm 
to recover its critical business functions and supporting 
assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a 
business interruption. The program includes governance, 
awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as 
well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, 
and manage business interruption and public safety risks. 
The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency 
program has played an integral role in maintaining the 
Firm’s business operations during and after various events.

Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The 
risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level across 
the industry. The complexities of these incidents and the 
strategies used by perpetrators continue to evolve. Under 
the Payments Control Program, methods are developed for 
managing the risk, implementing controls, and providing 
employee and client education and awareness trainings. The 
Firm’s monitoring of customer behavior is periodically

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or 
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate hold primary ownership of and 
accountability for managing compliance risk. The Firm’s 
Compliance Organization (“Compliance”), which is 
independent of the LOBs, provides independent review, 
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a 
focus on compliance with the legal and regulatory 
obligations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products 
and services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of legal and 
regulatory obligations, depending on the LOB and the 
jurisdiction, and include risks related to financial products 
and services, relationships and interactions with clients and 
customers, and employee activities. For example, 
compliance risks include those associated with anti-money 
laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, 
and complying with the rules and regulations related to the 
offering of products and services across jurisdictional 
borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s 
fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the 
applicable standard of care (such as the duties of loyalty or 
care), to act in the best interest of clients and customers or 
to treat clients and customers fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory 
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of 
responsibility.

CCOR Management implements policies and standards 
designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage, and report compliance risk.

Governance and oversight
Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for 
Operational Risk.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR 
Risk Management Framework. The Firm’s CCO also provides 
regular updates to the Audit Committee and the Board Risk 
Committee. In addition, certain Special Purpose Committees 
of the Board have previously been established to oversee 
the Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders. 

Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth 
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct 
themselves with integrity at all times and provides the 
principles that govern employee conduct with clients, 
customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with 
the markets and communities in which the Firm does 
business. The Code requires employees to promptly report 
any known or suspected violation of the Code, any internal 
Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s 
business. It also requires employees to report any illegal 
conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles 
of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients, 
customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, 
or agents. All newly hired employees are assigned Code 
training and current employees are periodically assigned 
Code training on an ongoing basis. Employees are required 
to affirm their compliance with the Code periodically. 

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of 
the Code through the Code Reporting Hotline by phone or 
the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain 
non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous 
reporting, and is available at all times globally, with 
translation services. It is administered by an outside service 
provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who 
raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the 
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.

132

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
that any action or inaction by an employee or employees 
could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact 
the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or 
compromise the Firm’s reputation.

Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and 
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles 
(the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how 
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the 
Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the 
Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides 
information and resources to help employees conduct 
business ethically and in compliance with the laws 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk 
Management on page 132 for further discussion of the 
Code.

Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR 
Management policy, which establishes the framework for 
governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and 
testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the 
Firm.

The Conduct Risk Steering Committee (CRSC) provides 
oversight of the Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more 
holistic view of conduct risks and to connect key programs 
across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and 
emerging areas of focus. 

Each committee of the Board oversees conduct risks within 
its scope of responsibilities, and the CRSC may escalate to 
such committees as appropriate.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of 
people management practices throughout the employee life 
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and 
development, performance management, promotion and 
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and 
designated corporate functions completes an assessment of 
conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and issues which 
may involve conduct risk, and provides business conduct 
training as appropriate.

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of 
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to 
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in 
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with 
clients and customers, and products and services offered by 
the Firm. 

Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services 
and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing 
the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:

•  managing actual and potential litigation and 

enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters

•  advising on products and services, including contract 

negotiation and documentation

•  advising on offering and marketing documents and new 

business initiatives

•  managing dispute resolution

• 

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes thereto

•  advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated 

and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and 

•  providing legal advice to the LOBs and Corporate, in 
alignment with the lines of defense described under 
Firmwide Risk Management on pages 79–83.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the 
Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In 
addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which 
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have the 
potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. 

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk 
Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s 
General Counsel and other members of Legal report on 
significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors 
and periodically to the Audit Committee. 

Legal serves on and advises various committees (including 
new business initiative and reputation risk committees) and 
advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential 
reputation risk issues.

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. 

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
and making business decisions. A dedicated independent 
function, Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), 
defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating to the 
management of model risk and risks associated with certain 
analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those 
used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital 
planning and analysis. 

The governance of analytical and judgment-based 
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent 
approach to the approach used for models, which is 
described in detail below. 

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the 
Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users 
and developers of models are responsible for developing, 
implementing and testing their models, as well as referring 
models to the Model Risk function for review and approval. 
Once models have been approved, model users and 
developers are responsible for maintaining a robust 
operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model 
users and developers may seek to enhance models in 
response to changes in the portfolios and in product and 
market developments, as well as to capture improvements 
in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities. 

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according 
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model 
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject 
to the approval of the Model Risk function. In its review of a 
model, the Model Risk function considers whether the 
model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will 
be used. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function 
analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the 
reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or 
require additional testing, including back-testing of model 
outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate 
level of management within the Model Risk function based 
on the relevant model tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new 
models, as well as material changes to existing models, 
prior to implementation in the operating environment. In 
certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the 
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user 
to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is 
to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the 
model and may include, for example, limitation of trading 
activity.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 136–138 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based 
valuations and other valuation techniques.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained 
consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the 
Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related 
commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to 
adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loans to reflect 
probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of 
the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-
related commitments is established to cover probable credit 
losses inherent in the lending-related commitments 
portfolio as of the balance sheet date. 

The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based 
component, an asset-specific component, and a component 
related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these 
components involves significant judgment on a number of 
matters. Refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 116–
117 and Note 13 for further information on these 
components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in 
establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for credit losses sensitivity
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to 
numerous factors, which may differ depending on the 
portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s 
assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of 
probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the 
balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to 
assess these economic conditions and loss data in 
estimating the allowance for credit losses and these 
estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on 
changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical 
data. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion. 

To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate 
judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following 
inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s 
modeled credit loss estimates as of December 31, 2019, 
without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects 
of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses:

•  A combined 5% decline in housing prices and a 100 
basis point increase in unemployment rates from 
expectations could imply:
  an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of 

approximately $250 million for PCI loans.

  an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates 
of approximately $50 million for residential real 
estate loans, excluding PCI loans.

•  For credit card loans, a 100 basis point increase in 

unemployment rates from expectations could imply an 
increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of 
approximately $850 million.

•  An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors 

consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s 
internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan 
portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled 
credit loss estimates of approximately $1.6 billion.
•  A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given 

default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan 
portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled 
credit loss estimates of approximately $200 million.

The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an 
indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical 
alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The 
changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to 
imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of 
those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not 
intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for 
loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled loss estimates to 
reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and 
conditions.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific 
factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses 
because management considers a variety of factors and 
inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. 
Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the 
same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies 
or product types, and changes in factors may be 
directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one 
factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, 
it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic 
conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior 
or other factors considered by management in estimating 
the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm 
follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk 
factors related to its loss estimates, management believes 
that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is 
appropriate.

Fair value 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives and structured note products. Certain assets 
and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring 
basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other 

136

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of 
the underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for

of netting adjustments; however, the $4.7 billion of derivative receivables classified 
as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to 
a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. 
The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting 
benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value 
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the 
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment 
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable 
market information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of 
observability of certain significant inputs requires 
management to assess all relevant empirical data in 
deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction 
details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, 
default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, 
valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange 
rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including 
unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 

the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for 
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net 
open risk position. The judgments made are typically 
affected by the type of product and its specific contractual 
terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the 
market as a whole. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion 
of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies 
or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting 
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s 
process and methodology used to conduct goodwill 
impairment testing is described in Note 15.

Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Firm reviewed 
current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, 
as well as actual and projections of business performance for 
all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm 
concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units 
was not impaired as of December 31, 2019. The fair values of 
these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by 
approximately 15% or higher and did not indicate a 
significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current 
projections and valuations. 

The projections for all of the Firm’s reporting units are 
consistent with management’s current short-term business 
outlook assumptions, and in the longer term, incorporate a 
set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm’s best 
estimates of long-term growth and returns on equity of its 
businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and 
peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2019.

Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards 
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points 
based on their account activity and the terms and 
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no 
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor

that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation 
allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be 
reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm 
determines that, based on revised estimates of future 
taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is 
more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax 
asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2019, 
management has determined it is more likely than not that 
the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the 
existing valuation allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary 
when additional information becomes available. Uncertain 
tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition 
threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit 
to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the 
largest amount of benefit that management believes is 
more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is 
possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s 
unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its 
effective income tax rate in the period in which the 
reassessment occurs.

Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income 
taxes.

estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

Management’s discussion and analysis

do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a 
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the 
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated 
cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed 
by cardholders. The rewards liability is sensitive to various 
assumptions, including cost per point and redemption rates 
for each of the various rewards programs, which are 
evaluated periodically. The liability is accrued as the 
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the 
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $6.4 billion 
and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Income taxes 
JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the 
various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These 
laws are often complex and may be subject to different 
interpretations. To determine the financial statement 
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the 
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax 
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and 
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex 
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as 
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when 
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the various 
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm 
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a 
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the 
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, 
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems 
of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. 
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be 
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the 
resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional 
reserves as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its 
estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax 
laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is 
possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income 
taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations 
in any reporting period.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from 
differences between assets and liabilities measured for 
financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s 
judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely 
than not. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets 
in connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit 
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews 
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. 
These reviews include management’s estimates and 
assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also 
incorporates various tax planning strategies, including 
strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs before they 
expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined

than twelve months on the Consolidated balance 
sheets as a lease liability with a corresponding 
right-of-use asset.

 •  Requires lessees and lessors to classify most 

leases using principles similar to existing lease 
accounting, but eliminates the “bright line” 
classification tests.

 •  Expands qualitative and quantitative leasing 

disclosures.

•  The Firm elected the available practical expedient to not 
reassess whether existing contracts contain a lease or 
whether classification or unamortized initial lease costs 
would be different under the new lease guidance. The Firm 
elected the modified retrospective transition method, through 
a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings without 
revising prior periods.

FASB Standards Issued but not adopted as of December 31, 2019

Summary of guidance

Financial 
Instruments – 
Credit Losses 
(“CECL”)

Issued June 2016

 •  Establishes a single allowance framework for all 
financial assets carried at amortized cost and 
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This 
framework requires that management’s estimate 
reflects credit losses over the full remaining 
expected life and considers expected future 
changes in macroeconomic conditions.

 •  Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and 

requires recognition of the nonaccretable 
difference as an increase to the allowance for 
expected credit losses on financial assets 
purchased with more than insignificant credit 
deterioration since origination, with a 
corresponding increase in the recorded 
investment of the related loans. 

 •  Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, 

limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-
offs, when estimating the allowance for credit 
losses for in scope financial assets (including 
collateral dependent assets).

 •  Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS 

securities to incorporate an allowance, which will 
allow for reversals of credit impairments in the 
event that the credit of an issuer improves.

 •  Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings as of the beginning of the 
reporting period of adoption.

Effects on financial statements

•  Adopted January 1, 2020.

•  The adoption of this guidance resulted in a net increase to the 
allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion and a decrease to 
retained earnings of $2.7 billion, primarily driven by Card. 
Under the CECL framework, the Firm estimates losses over a 
two-year forecast period using the weighted-average of a 
range of macroeconomic scenarios (established on a 
Firmwide basis), and then reverts to longer term historical 
loss experience to estimate losses over more extended 
periods.

•  The Firm elected to phase-in the impact to retained earnings 
of $2.7 billion to regulatory capital, at 25 percent per year in 
each of 2020 to 2023 (“CECL transitional period”). Based on 
the Firm’s capital as of December 31, 2019, the estimated 
impact to the Standardized CET1 capital ratio will be a 
reduction of approximately 4 bps for each transitional year.

•  As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the fair value 

option for certain securities financing agreements. The 
difference between their carrying amount and fair value was 
immaterial and was recorded as part of the Firm’s 
cumulative-effect adjustment.

•  Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Goodwill

Issued January 
2017

 •  Requires recognition of an impairment loss when 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls 
below its carrying value.

 •  Eliminates the requirement that an impairment 
loss be recognized only if the estimated implied 
fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying 
value.

•  Adopted January 1, 2020.

•  No impact upon adoption as the guidance is to be applied 

prospectively.
