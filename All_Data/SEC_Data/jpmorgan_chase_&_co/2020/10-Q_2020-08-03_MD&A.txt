(a)  In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card 

income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b)  Reflects the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that 
became effective in the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk 
Management on pages 49-54 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85-92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s capital metrics.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the second 
quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019, unless 
otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview 
JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $4.7 billion for the 
second quarter of 2020, or $1.38 per share, on net 
revenue of $33.0 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 7% and 
ROTCE of 9%. The Firm recorded a number of significant 
items in the second quarter of 2020, including an addition 
to the allowance for credit losses of $8.9 billion, $678 
million of markups on held-for-sale positions, including 
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in 
CIB and CB, and a $510 million gain in Credit Adjustments & 
Other in CIB driven by funding spread tightening on 
derivatives.
•  Net income was down 51%, driven by an increase in the 

provision for credit losses across the Firm.

•  Total net revenue increased 15%. Noninterest revenue 
was $19.1 billion, up 33%, largely driven by higher CIB 
Markets revenue and Investment Banking fees. The 
increase in revenue also included $678 million of 
markups on held-for-sale positions, including unfunded 
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and 
CB, and a $510 million gain in Credit Adjustments & 
Other in CIB driven by funding spread tightening on 
derivatives.  Net interest income was $13.9 billion, down 
4%, with the impact of lower rates predominantly offset 
by higher net interest income in CIB Markets and balance 
sheet growth.  

•  Noninterest expense was $16.9 billion, up 4%, 

predominantly driven by revenue-related expense, 
primarily compensation, partially offset by lower 
marketing expense in Card as a result of lower travel-
related benefits and lower investments in marketing 
campaigns, as well as lower structural expense. 

5

Selected capital-related metrics
•  The Firm’s CET1 capital was $191 billion, and the 

Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.4% and 
13.2%, respectively.

•  The Firm’s SLR was 6.8%. As of June 30, 2020, the SLR 

reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury 
securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, as 
required by the Federal Reserve’s interim final rule issued 
on April 1, 2020. The Firm’s SLR excluding the temporary 
relief was 5.7%.

•  The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the second quarter of 2020 

at $61.76, up 4% versus the prior year.

ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer 
to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-
GAAP Financial Measures on pages 22-23 for a further 
discussion of each of these measures.

•  The provision for credit losses was $10.5 billion, up $9.3 
billion from the prior year, driven by additions to the 
allowance for credit losses, reflecting further 
deterioration and increased uncertainty in the 
macroeconomic outlook as a result of the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The addition in the wholesale 
allowance was $4.6 billion across multiple industry 
sectors, and the addition in the consumer allowance was 
$4.4 billion, largely in Card.  

•  The total allowance for credit losses was $34.3 billion at 
June 30, 2020, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage 
ratio of 3.32%, compared with 1.39% in the prior year, 
driven by the additions to allowance for credit losses and 
the adoption of CECL. The Firm’s nonperforming assets 
totaled $8.4 billion at June 30, 2020, an increase from 
$5.3 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven by 
downgrades in the wholesale portfolio across multiple 
industries on client credit deterioration, and the inclusion 
of purchased credit deteriorated loans in the mortgage 
portfolio, which are subject to nonaccrual loan treatment 
following the adoption of CECL.

•  Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 4%, 
largely reflecting drawdowns on committed revolving 
credit facilities in March and higher loan balances in 
AWM, as well as loans originated under the Small 
Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection 
Program (“PPP”). The loan growth was partially offset by 
lower loan balances in Home Lending and Card. 

•  Firmwide average deposits of $1.9 trillion were up 25%, 
reflecting significant inflows across the Firm, primarily 
driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers and 
clients looked to remain liquid as a result of market 
conditions.

Recent events
On June 29, 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had 
completed the 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review (“CCAR”) stress test process. The Firm’s indicative 
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 3.3% and the 
Federal Reserve Board will provide the Firm with its final 
SCB requirement by August 31, 2020. The Firm’s Board of 
Directors currently intends to maintain the quarterly 
common stock dividend of $0.90 per share for the third 
quarter of 2020. Additionally, in June 2020, the Federal 
Reserve directed all large bank holding companies, including 
the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases, at least 
through the end of the third quarter of 2020. 

2020 outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q, and 
are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 92 and Risk Factors on 
page 200 of this Form 10-Q and pages 6–28 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of 
those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could 
cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially 
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no 
assurance that actual results in the full year of 2020 will be in 
line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not 
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of 
2020 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global 
and U.S. economies, the COVID-19 pandemic, financial 
markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the 
competitive environment, client and customer activity 
levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the 
U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each 
of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and 
its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate 
adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to 
ongoing developments in the business, economic, 
regulatory and legal environments in which it operates. The 
outlook information contained in this Form 10-Q supersedes 
all outlook information furnished by the Firm in its periodic 
reports filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Form 10-Q. 

Firmwide
•  Management expects full-year 2020 net interest income, 
on a managed basis, to be approximately $56 billion, 
market dependent.

•  Management expects adjusted expense for the full-year 

2020 to be approximately $65 billion.

•  In the wholesale portfolio segment, through June 30, 

2020, the Firm has provided client assistance to 
approximately 12,000 clients, primarily risk-rated clients 
in CCB. The majority of the client assistance was payment 
deferrals on approximately $23 billion of loans. As of 
June 30, 2020, there were approximately $17 billion of 
retained loans that were still under payment deferral.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for additional 
information on assistance granted to customers and clients. 
Refer to Consumer Credit portfolio on pages 62-66 and 
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 67-76 for additional 
information on retained loans that were still under payment 
deferral as of June 30, 2020.

Approximately three-quarters of the Firm’s branch network 
is operational, and ATMs remain accessible. The Firm also 
continues to provide a wide range of banking services 
accessible to clients and customers online.

Protecting and supporting employees
In addition to widespread work from home arrangements, 
the Firm has taken actions to protect and support its 
employees. These actions include providing increased safety 
measures for those employees whose job functions require 
them to continue to be onsite, a special payment for certain 
eligible employees and expanded healthcare resources.  

Supporting communities
Since March, the Firm has committed $250 million to help 
address humanitarian needs and long-term economic 
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
communities in which the Firm operates. This includes a 
$200 million commitment to be deployed over time to 
support underserved small businesses and nonprofits and 
$50 million in grants to help vulnerable communities 
impacted by the pandemic. 

Business Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic
In the first quarter of 2020, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Firm invoked resiliency plans to allow its 
businesses to remain operational, utilizing disaster recovery 
sites and implementing alternative work arrangements 
globally, including work from home.

The Firm also implemented strategies and procedures 
designed to help it respond to increased market volatility, 
client demand for credit and liquidity, distress in certain 
industries/sectors and the ongoing impacts to consumers 
and businesses.

In the second quarter, the Firm continued its focus on 
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including developing 
plans to return employees to the office. The Firm continues 
to actively monitor the dynamic health and safety situations 
at local and regional levels, and plans remain flexible to 
adapt as these situations evolve.

Supporting clients and customers
The Firm has continued to support its clients and customers 
during the challenging conditions caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, including by providing liquidity. Since March, the 
Firm has extended more than $350 billion of new and 
renewed credit to its clients and customers, of which 
approximately $300 billion was in the wholesale 
businesses.

The Firm is participating in a number of U.S government 
facilities and programs including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Small 
Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection 
Program (“PPP”). At June 30, 2020, the Firm had 
approximately $28 billion of loans under the PPP. Refer to 
Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic on pages 11-12 for more information on U.S. 
Government facilities and programs.

In addition, in March 2020 the Firm began providing 
payment deferrals on loans and auto leases, refunded fees, 
and modified covenants for clients and customers. 

•  In the consumer portfolio segment, through June 30, 

2020, the Firm has provided customer assistance to over 
2 million accounts, including refunding over $83 million 
in fees and granting payment deferrals on over $79 
billion of loans and leases, of which $42 billion was for 
third-party mortgage loans serviced. As of June 30, 2020 
the Firm had approximately $28 billion of retained loans 
that were still under payment deferral.

Departure of the U.K. from the EU
The Firm continues to execute on its Firmwide Brexit 
Implementation program and remains focused on the 
following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its 
EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client 
readiness; and business and operational readiness. The 
Firm’s Brexit-related planning in the second half of 2020 
will focus on the possibility that the U.K. will complete its 
departure from the EU without having agreed the terms of 
their future relationship, which is commonly referred to as 
“hard Brexit,” as the July 1, 2020 deadline for the U.K. to 
request an extension of the transition period has passed. 
This will require completion of the relocation of certain 
front office roles from the U.K. to EU locations, and 
finalization of the migration of EU clients and certain 
positions to EU entities by the end of 2020. The COVID-19 
pandemic has added incremental risk to the Firm’s Brexit 
Implementation program due to the potential impact on its 
ability to execute changes such as relocation of employees 
given travel restrictions, or the ability of clients to be 
operationally ready to the extent that they have diverted 
resources during 2020 to address the effects of the 
pandemic.

Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition
On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update 
providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying 
generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and 
hedge relationships affected by reference rate reform. This 
update provides for various elective options, referred to as 
“practical expedients,” that are intended to simplify the 
operational impact of applying U.S. GAAP to certain 
transactions. The Firm expects to apply certain of these 
practical expedients relating to the IBOR transition in the 
second half of 2020. Refer to Accounting and Reporting 
Developments on page 91 for additional information. The 
Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being 
considered by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(“IASB”) and U.S. Treasury Department regarding 
accounting and tax implications of reference rate reform. 

The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans to 
appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR 
discontinuation. Refer to Business Developments on page 
47 of the 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s 
initiatives to address the expected discontinuation of the 
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

Regulatory Developments Relating to the 
COVID-19 Pandemic

Since March 2020, the U.S. government as well as central 
banks and banking authorities around the world have taken 
and continue to take actions to help individuals, households 
and businesses that have been adversely affected by the 
economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, 
provides, among other things, funding to support loan 
facilities to assist consumers and businesses. Set forth 
below is a summary as of the date of this Form 10-Q of U.S. 
government actions currently impacting the Firm and U.S. 
government programs in which the Firm is participating to 
support individuals, businesses, and the broader economy. 
The Firm will continue to assess ongoing developments in 
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. government actions

Eligible retained income definition. On March 17, 2020, the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal 
Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(“FDIC”), collectively the “federal banking agencies,” issued 
an interim final rule that revised the definition of “eligible 
retained income” in the regulatory capital rules that apply 
to all U.S. banking organizations. On March 23, 2020, the 
Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that revised the 
definition of “eligible retained income” for purposes of the 
total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) buffer requirements 
that apply to global systemically important banking 
organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained 
income makes any automatic limitations on payout 
distributions that could apply under the agencies’ capital 
rules or TLAC rule take effect on a more graduated basis in 
the event that a banking organization’s capital, leverage and 
TLAC ratios were to decline below regulatory requirements 
(including buffers). The March 17, 2020 interim final rule 
was issued, in conjunction with an interagency statement 
encouraging banking organizations to use their capital and 
liquidity buffers, to further support banking organizations’ 
abilities to lend to households and businesses affected by 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reserve requirements. On March 26, 2020, the Federal 
Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero 
percent, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for 
all depository institutions, an action that freed up liquidity 
in the banking system to support lending to households and 
businesses. 

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55-59 and 
Note 21 for additional information on the reduction to the 
reserve requirement.

Regulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) 
transition delay. On March 31, 2020, the federal banking 
agencies issued an interim final rule that provided banking 
organizations with the option to delay the effects of CECL on 
regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year 

11

transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). The 
Firm elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 and Note 
22 on pages 176-177 for additional information on the 
CECL capital transition provisions and the impact to the 
Firm’s capital metrics.

Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary revision. On 
April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final 
rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of 
total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR 
for bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance 
sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at 
Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions became effective 
April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect through March 31, 
2021.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 and Note 
22 for additional information on the Firm’s SLR.

Loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking 
agencies along with the National Credit Union 
Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, in consultation with the state financial regulators, 
issued an interagency statement revising a March 22, 2020 
interagency statement on loan modifications and the 
reporting for financial institutions working with customers 
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). 
The IA Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with 
borrowers where the loans are prudently underwritten, and 
not considered past due or carried on nonaccrual status, 
should not result in the loans automatically being 
considered modified in a troubled debt restructuring 
(“TDR”) for accounting and financial reporting purposes, or 
for purposes of their respective risk-based capital rules, 
which would otherwise require financial institutions subject 
to the capital rules to hold more capital. The IA Statement 
also clarified the interaction between its previous guidance 
and Section 4013 of the CARES Act, which provides certain 
financial institutions with the option to suspend the 
application of accounting guidance for TDRs for a limited 
period of time for loan modifications made to address the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered TDRs as:
• 

they represent short-term or other insignificant 
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan 
modification assessments or the IA Statement guidance, 
or

• 

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the 
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided 
under section 4013 of the CARES Act. 

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of 
the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. 
Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 and Note 12 for 

additional information on the Firm’s loan modification 
activities.

U.S. government facilities and programs. Beginning in March 
2020, the Federal Reserve announced a suite of facilities 
using its emergency lending powers under section 13(3) of 
the Federal Reserve Act to support the flow of credit to 
individuals, households and businesses adversely affected 
by the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the broader 
economy. These facilities include the Money Market Mutual 
Fund Liquidity Facility (“MMLF”), Main Street Lending 
Facilities, Primary Dealer Credit Facility (“PDCF”), 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”), Secondary 
Market Corporate Credit Facility (“SMCCF”) and Term Asset-
Backed Securities Loan Facility (“TALF”). In addition, 
beginning April 3, 2020, the PPP, established by the CARES 
Act and administered by the SBA, authorized eligible 
lenders to provide nonrecourse loans to eligible borrowers 
until August 8, 2020 to provide an incentive for these 
businesses to keep their workers on their payroll. The Firm 
has participated and is participating in certain of these 
facilities and programs, as needed, to assist its clients and 
customers or to support the broader economy.

(a)  In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions to lending- and deposit-related 

fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b)  In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card 

income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c)  Included operating lease income of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively and $2.8 billion and

$2.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB,  
reflecting:

•  higher debt underwriting fees due to increased industry-

wide fees and wallet share gains in both investment-grade 
and high-yield bonds

•  higher equity underwriting fees due to increased 

industry-wide fees and wallet share gains, primarily in 
follow-on offerings and convertible securities markets

–  the increased activity in debt and equity underwriting 
reflected clients seeking access to liquidity as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic

•  higher advisory fees driven by a few large completed 

transactions.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 31-37 and Note 6 for 
additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased and included two 
significant items, both of which represent reversals of a 
portion of the losses that were recognized in the first 
quarter of 2020: 

•  $678 million of markups on held-for-sale positions, 

including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing 
portfolio in CIB and CB, compared with $896 million of 
markdowns in the first quarter of 2020, and

•  a $510 million gain in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB 

driven by funding spread tightening on derivatives, 
compared with a $951 million loss in the first quarter of 
2020.

Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue 
increased in CIB driven by strong client activity in Fixed 
Income Markets primarily in Rates, Currencies & Emerging 
Markets, and Credit; and in Equity Markets related to 
derivatives and Cash Equities. The prior year included a gain 
from the initial public offering (“IPO”) of Tradeweb. 

The increase in principal transactions revenue also reflected 
net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in 
Corporate, compared with net losses in the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business 
performance on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 
31-37, pages 38-41 and page 46, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 

Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased due to lower 
deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower transaction 
activity and the impact of fee refunds related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher cash 
management fees in CIB and CB. Refer to CCB segment 
results on pages 26-30, CIB on pages 31-37 and CB on 
pages 38-41, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information.

For information on asset management, administration and 
commissions revenue, refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment 
results on pages 26-30, pages 31-37 and pages 42-45, 
respectively, and Note 6.

13

Refer to Corporate segment results on page 46 and Note 10 
for information on investment securities gains.

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to:

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 
production margins, partially offset by the absence of 
gains on loan sales in the prior year in Home Lending, and

•  higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting higher 
MSR risk management results due to the absence of 
losses resulting from updates to model inputs in the prior 
year partially offset by lower operating revenue reflecting 
a lower level of third-party loans serviced.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, Note 6 and 
15 for further information.

Card income decreased due to lower net interchange 
income reflecting lower card sales volumes that began in 
March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset 
by higher annual fees and lower acquisition costs.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 26-30, 
pages 31-37 and pages 38-41, as well as and Note 6 for 
further information.

Other income decreased, reflecting:

•  higher costs associated with using forward contracts to 

hedge certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net 
investment exposures in Treasury and CIO,

•  increased amortization on higher levels of alternative 
energy investments in CIB. The increased amortization 
was more than offset by lower income tax expense from 
the associated tax credits

•  lower market-driven results on certain investments in 

Corporate

partially offset by

•  higher operating lease income from growth in auto 

operating lease volume in CCB

Refer to Note 17 for further information.

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of lower 
rates, predominantly offset by higher net interest income in 
CIB Markets and balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.8 
trillion, up $481 billion, and the yield was 2.31%, down 
142 bps, primarily due to lower rates. The net yield on 
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.99%, a decrease of 50 
bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 2.27%, down 
108 bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial 
measure. Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, 
interest and rates schedule on pages 189–190 for further 
details; and the Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 22-23 for a 
further discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB 
markets.

Year-to-date results
Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB,  
reflecting: 

•  higher debt underwriting fees due to increased industry-
wide fees and wallet share gains in investment-grade 
bonds, and for high-yield bonds, after the markets 
stabilized in the second quarter of 2020

•  higher equity underwriting fees due to increased industry-
wide fees and wallet share gains, primarily in follow-on 
offerings and convertible securities markets

–  the increased activity in debt and equity underwriting 
reflected clients seeking access to liquidity as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic

partially offset by

•  lower advisory fees driven by a lower number of completed 

transactions.

Principal transactions revenue increased despite the year-
to-date results of the two significant items noted below: 

•  a $441 million net loss in CIB’s Credit Adjustments & 
Other predominantly driven by losses on certain 
components of fair value option elected liabilities, as well 
as the impact of funding spread widening on derivatives, 
and

•  $218 million of net markdowns on held-for-sale 

positions, including unfunded commitments, in the bridge 
financing portfolio in CIB and CB.

Excluding these two items, principal transactions revenue 
increased in CIB, driven by strong client activity in Fixed 
Income Markets primarily in Rates, Currencies & Emerging 
Markets, and Credit; and in Equity Markets related to 
derivatives and Cash Equities.

Lending- and deposit-related fees was relatively flat as the 
lower deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower 
transaction activity and the impact of fee refunds related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, was offset by higher cash 
management fees in CIB and CB.

Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue increased driven by:

•  higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on higher 

client-driven volume, and

•  higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of 

inflows into liquidity products, and in CCB related to a 
higher level of investment assets,

partially offset by

•  lower volume of annuity sales in CCB.

Investment securities gains in both periods reflected the 
impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. 

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to:

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

mortgage production volumes and margins, partially 
offset by the absence of gains on loan sales in the prior 
year in Home Lending, and

14

•  higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting higher 
MSR risk management results due to the absence of 
losses resulting from updates to model inputs in the prior 
year, predominantly offset by lower operating revenue 
reflecting a lower level of third-party loans serviced and 
faster prepayment speeds on lower rates.

Card income decreased due to lower net interchange 
income reflecting lower card sales volumes that began in 
March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset 
by higher annual fees.

Other income decreased reflecting:

•  net losses on certain equity investments in CIB, compared 

with net gains in the prior year

•  net valuation losses on certain investments in AWM, 

compared with gains in the prior year

•  increased amortization on higher levels of alternative 

energy investments in CIB. The increased amortization is 

more than offset by lower income tax expense from the 
associated tax credits, and

•  higher costs associated with using forward contracts to 

hedge certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated net 
investment exposures in Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by

•  higher operating lease income from growth in auto 

operating lease volume in CCB

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of lower 
rates, predominantly offset by higher net interest income in 
CIB Markets and balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.6 
trillion, up $324 billion, and the yield was 2.70%, down 
106 bps, primarily due to lower rates. The net yield on 
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.17%, a decrease of 36 
bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 2.61%, down 
78 bps.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and 
lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology 
applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further 
information.

Quarterly results
The provision for credit losses increased driven by the 
further deterioration and increased uncertainty in the 
macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in wholesale and consumer.

The increase in wholesale reflects a net addition of $4.6 
billion to the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs 
impacting multiple industry sectors.
The increase in consumer was driven by:

•  additions of $4.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses, 
consisting of $2.9 billion for Card, $900 million for Home 
Lending, $285 million for Auto, and $272 million for CBB,

partially offset by

•  lower net charge-offs in Card reflecting higher recoveries.

The prior year included a $234 million net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, CIB on pages 
31-37, CB on pages 38-41, AWM on pages 42-45, the 
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77-78, and Note 13 
for additional information on the credit portfolio and the 
allowance for credit losses. 

Year-to-date results
The provision for credit losses increased driven by the 
deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic in consumer and wholesale.
The increase in consumer was driven by:

•  additions of $8.7 billion to the allowance for credit losses,  
consisting of $6.6 billion for Card, $1.2 billion for Home 
Lending, $520 million for Auto, and $352 million for CBB,

partially offset by

•  lower net charge-offs reflecting higher recoveries in 

Home Lending on a loan sale in the first quarter of 2020, 
and in Card, largely offset by higher charge-offs in Card 
on loan growth in the prior year.

The prior year included a $221 million net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.
The increase in wholesale reflects a net addition of $7.0 
billion to the allowance for credit losses across the LOBs  
impacting multiple industry sectors.

$264 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Compensation expense increased driven by higher 
revenue-related expense in CIB.

Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of:

•  lower marketing expense in Card as a result of lower 
travel-related benefits and investments in marketing 
campaigns

•  lower structural expense, including lower travel and 

entertainment across the businesses, as well as lower 
payment processing costs,

partially offset by

•  higher volume-related expense, including depreciation 
from growth in auto lease assets in CCB, and brokerage 
expense in CIB

•  higher investments in the businesses, including 

technology.

Year-to-date results
Compensation expense increased driven by higher

Quarterly results
The effective tax rate increased as the reduction in income 
tax expense due to the impact of changes in the level and 
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and 
state and local taxes was more than offset by the absence of 
the $768 million of tax benefits recorded in the prior year 
related to the resolution of certain tax audits.

Year-to-date results
The effective tax rate decreased driven by changes in the 
level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. 
federal, and state and local taxes, as well as the more 
significant effect of certain tax benefits on a lower level of 
pre-tax income. The decrease was partially offset by the 
recognition of $874 million of tax benefits recorded in the 
prior year related to the resolution of certain tax audits.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased primarily as a result of significant deposit inflows, 
which also funded asset growth across the Firm, including in 
investment securities. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s 
placements of its excess cash with various central banks, 
including the Federal Reserve Banks. 

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55-59 and 
Note 11 for information on federal funds sold and securities 
purchased under resale agreements.

Trading assets increased compared with lower levels at 
year-end predominantly due to client-driven market-making 
activities in debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, as 
well as higher derivative receivables in CIB as a result of 
market movements. 

Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities increased, reflecting net purchases 
of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS 
in the available-for-sale (“AFS”) portfolio, driven by interest 
rate risk management activities and cash deployment, 
partially offset by a non-cash transfer of $26 billion of U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS from the AFS to the held-
to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio, resulting in a comparable 
increase in HTM.
Refer to Corporate segment results on page 46, Investment 
Portfolio Risk Management on page 79, and Notes 2 and 10

Loans increased, reflecting:

•  the outstanding loans from the March drawdown activity 

on committed revolving credit facilities in CIB and CB, as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of the 
PPP loans in CBB and CB,

partially offset by

•  lower loans in Card due to the decline in sales volume 

that began in March as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic, as well as the impact of seasonality; and lower 
loans in Home Lending primarily due to net repayments.

The allowance for loan losses increased primarily reflecting 
the deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, consisting of:

•  a $8.6 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the 

credit card and residential real estate portfolios 

•  a net $6.2 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs  

impacting multiple industry sectors, and

•  a net $4.2 billion addition as a result of the adoption of 

CECL. 

There were also additions to the allowance for lending-
related commitments, which is included in other liabilities 
on the consolidated balance sheets, of $920 million related 
to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and $98 million 
related to the adoption of CECL, resulting in total additions to 
the allowance for credit losses of $15.7 billion and $4.3 
billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2020. 

18

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
60-79, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for a more detailed 
discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles decreased reflecting 
lower MSRs as a result of faster prepayment speeds on lower 
rates and the realization of expected cash flows, partially 
offset by net additions to the MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for 
additional information.

Selected Consolidated balance sheets data (continued)

Other assets increased reflecting higher cash collateral 
placed with central counterparties, and the Firm’s 
participation in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 
(“FRBB”) MMLF. The assets purchased from money market 
mutual fund clients related to the MMLF were funded by 
nonrecourse advances from the FRBB, which are recorded in 
short-term borrowings. Refer to Regulatory Developments 
Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55-59 for additional

Deposits increased reflecting significant inflows across the 
LOBs primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as 
customers and clients looked to remain liquid as a result of 
market conditions.

•  In the wholesale businesses, the inflows principally 

occurred in March, and in general were maintained through 
the second quarter.

•  In CCB, the increase was driven by the continued growth in 

both existing and new accounts, as well as COVID-19 
related factors, such as the government stimulus for 
consumers and small businesses, lower consumer 
spending, and delays in tax payments.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55-59 and 
Notes 2 and 16 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

•  in CIB, a net increase related to client-driven market-

making activities, and higher secured financing of trading 
assets, partially offset by a decline in the Firm's 
participation in the Federal Reserve's open market 
operations, and 

•  in Treasury and CIO, higher secured financing of AFS 

investment securities. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management 
on pages 55-59 and Note 11 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased driven by the Firm’s 
participation in the FRBB’s MMLF, as well as a change in mix 
of funding sources in CIB activities from securities sold under 
repurchase agreements in CIB. The nonrecourse advances 
from the FRBB funded the assets purchased from money 
market mutual fund clients related to the MMLF, which are 
recorded in other assets.

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Liquidity Risk Management on 
pages 55-59 for additional information.

Trading liabilities increased in CIB as a result of client-driven 
market-making activities, which resulted in higher levels of 
short positions in debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, 
as well as higher derivative payables as a result of market 
movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional 
information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased reflecting 
higher client payables related to client-driven activities in CIB.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased  
reflecting higher levels of Firm-administered multi-seller 
conduit commercial paper held by third parties.

Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 21 and 
Notes 14 and 23 for further information on Firm-sponsored 
VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased as a result of higher FHLB net 
advances, net issuance of senior and subordinated debt, and 
higher fair value hedge accounting adjustments related to 
lower interest rates. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on 
pages 55-59 for additional information on the Firm’s long-
term debt activities.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting the net impact of 
capital actions, net income, the adoption of CECL and an 
increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
(“AOCI”). The increase in AOCI was driven by net unrealized 
gains on AFS securities, and higher valuation of interest rate 
cash flow hedges. Refer to page 96 for information on 
changes in stockholders’ equity and Capital actions on page 
53.

Operating activities
•  In 2020, cash used resulted from higher trading assets 

and other assets, largely offset by higher trading 
liabilities and accounts payable and other liabilities.

•  In 2019, cash used primarily resulted from higher trading 

assets-debt and equity instruments and securities 
borrowed, partially offset by increased trading liabilities 
and accounts payable and other liabilities, and net 
proceeds from loans held-for-sale.

Investing activities
•  In 2020, cash used was driven by net purchases of 
investment securities and net loan originations.
•  In 2019, cash provided resulted from a decrease in 

securities purchased under resale agreements, and net 
proceeds from sales of loans held-for-investment, 
partially offset by net purchases of investment securities.

Financing activities
•  In 2020, cash provided was due to higher deposits, an 

increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned 
or sold under repurchase agreements, and net proceeds 
from long-term borrowings.    

•  In 2019, cash provided resulted from higher securities 

loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and higher 
deposits.

•  For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock. On March 15, 2020, in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended 
repurchases of its common equity. Additionally, in June 
2020, the Federal Reserve directed all large bank holding 
companies, including the Firm, to discontinue net share 
repurchases, at least through the end of the third quarter 
of 2020.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that 
may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed as off-
balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). 

Special-purpose entities
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities 
(“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees). 

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts 
and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions 
with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. 

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet 
arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred 
to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on 
pages 93-97.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP 
financial measures at the Firmwide and segment 
level. These non-GAAP measures include:

•  Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the 

overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis 
comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” 
basis)

•  Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 

less noninterest expense

•  Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets 

businesses

•  Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS

•  Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, 

excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use Of 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance 
Measures on pages 57–59 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of non-
GAAP financial measures.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the 
products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial 
information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating 
Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed 
basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 22-23 for a 
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and further refinements may 
be implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also 
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the 
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance. 

Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business 
segments may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue and expense are generally 
recognized in the segment responsible for the related 
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) 

involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.

Business segment capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred 
to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and 
methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as 
a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer 
to Line of business equity on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2019 Form 10-K for additional information on business 
segment capital allocation. 

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of business 
segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion 
of those methodologies.

Business segment changes
In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a 
Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a 
realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. 
The Wholesale Payments business comprises:

•  Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB
•  Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance 

was previously reported in Lending in CIB.

In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, 
the assets, liabilities and headcount associated with the 
Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, 
and the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services 
business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily 
on client relationships. Prior periods have been revised to 
reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

•  growth in deposits in CBB, and loan margin expansion in 

Noninterest revenue was $4.1 billion, flat compared to the 
prior year, reflecting:

Card. 

Noninterest revenue was $8.1 billion, relatively flat, driven by:

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 

•  lower card income due to lower net interchange income 

production margins, partially offset by the absence of gains 
on loan sales in the prior year, and

•  higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting higher 

MSR risk management results due to the absence of losses 
resulting from updates to model inputs in the prior year 
partially offset by lower operating revenue reflecting a 
lower level of third-party loans serviced,

offset by

•  lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction activity 

and the impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 
pandemic, 

•  lower card income due to lower net interchange income 

reflecting lower card sales volumes that began in March as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher 
annual fees and lower acquisition costs, and

•  lower volume of annuity sales.  

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in 
the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage 
fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $6.6 billion, down 3%, driven by 
lower marketing expense on lower travel-related benefits and 
lower investments in marketing campaigns, as well as lower 
structural expense, including lower payment processing costs.

The provision for credit losses was $5.8 billion, an increase of 
$4.7 billion from the prior year, driven by:

•  additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the 

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of: $2.9 
billion for Card, $900 million for Home Lending, $490 
million for CBB, and $310 million for Auto,

partially offset by 

•  lower net charge-offs in Card reflecting higher recoveries.

The prior year included a $200 million net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
60-79 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77-78 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance 
for credit losses.

reflecting lower card sales volumes that began in March as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher 
annual fees,

•  lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction activity 

and the impact of fee refunds related to the COVID-19 
pandemic, and

•  lower volume of annuity sales,

offset by

•  higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher 
mortgage production volumes and margins, partially offset 
by the absence of gains on loan sales in the prior year, 

•  higher auto lease volume, and

•  higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting higher 

MSR risk management results due to the absence of losses 
resulting from updates to model inputs in the prior year, 
predominantly offset by lower operating revenue reflecting 
a lower level of third-party loans serviced and faster 
prepayment speeds on lower rates.

Noninterest expense was $13.7 billion, flat compared to the 
prior year, reflecting:

•  lower structural expenses, including lower payment 

processing costs, and 

•  lower marketing expenses on lower travel-related benefits 

and investments in marketing campaigns,

offset by

•  higher volume- and revenue-related expense, including 

depreciation on auto lease assets, and investments in the 
business.

The provision for credit losses was $11.6 billion, an increase 
of $9.2 billion from the prior year, driven by: 
•  additions to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the 

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of: $6.6 
billion for Card, $1.2 billion for Home Lending, $649 million 
for CBB, and $560 million for Auto, 

partially offset by 
•  lower net charge-offs reflecting higher recoveries in Home 
Lending on a loan sale in the first quarter of 2020, and in 
Card, largely offset by higher charge-offs in Card on loan 
growth in the prior year.

The prior year included a $200 million net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are 
considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a)  At June 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.3 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm 

recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(b)  At June 30, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $561 

million and $1.8 billion, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(c)  At June 30, 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates included PCD loans. The rate prior to January 1, 2020 was revised to include the impact of PCI loans. 
(d)  At June 30, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $826 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, that are 30 or 

more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(e)  Generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio 

on pages 62-66 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

(f)  At June 30, 2020, included $19.9 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not 

expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(g)  At June 30, 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic were $18.2 billion, $4.4 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not 
considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period 
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a)  Includes credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed centrally within CIB and funding valuation adjustments (“FVA”) on derivatives and certain 

components of fair value option elected liabilities, which are primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated 
hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. 

Quarterly results
Net income was $5.5 billion, up 85%, with record revenue 
more than offsetting higher noninterest expense and an 
increase in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $16.4 billion, up 66%.

Banking revenue was $5.0 billion, up 46%.
•  Investment Banking revenue was $3.4 billion, up 91%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 54%, 
reflecting higher fees across products, as well as $659 
million of markups on held-for-sale positions, including 
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio 
as a result of improved market conditions. The Firm 
maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment Banking 
fees, according to Dealogic.
–  Debt underwriting fees were $1.3 billion, up 55%, 

driven by increased industry-wide fees and wallet share 
gains in both investment-grade and high-yield bonds.
–  Equity underwriting fees were $977 million, up 93%,  
driven by both increased industry-wide fees and wallet 
share gains primarily in follow-on offerings and 
convertible securities markets.

–  The increased activity in debt and equity 

underwriting reflected clients seeking access to 
liquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

–  Advisory fees were $602 million, up 15%, driven by a 

few large completed transactions.

•  Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.4 billion, down 3%, 

driven by a reporting re-classification for certain 
expenses which are now reported as a reduction of 
revenue in Merchant Services. In addition, the impact of 
higher deposit balances was predominantly offset by 
deposit margin compression.

•  Lending revenue was $270 million, up 4%, with higher 
net interest income on higher loan balances, as well as 

higher fees, offset by fair value losses on hedges of 
accrual loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $11.3 billion, up 
77%. Markets revenue was $9.7 billion, up 79%.
•  Fixed Income Markets revenue was $7.3 billion, up 99%, 
or up 120% excluding a gain from the IPO of Tradeweb in 
the prior year, driven by strong performance across 
products, primarily in Rates, Currencies & Emerging 
Markets, and Credit.

•  Equity Markets revenue was $2.4 billion, up 38%, 
predominantly driven by strong client activity in 
derivatives and Cash Equities.

•  Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 5%, 

predominantly driven by deposit balance and fee growth 
partially offset by deposit margin compression.

•  Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $510 million, 

driven by funding spread tightening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $6.8 billion, up 19%, driven by 
higher revenue-related compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, 
predominantly driven by net additions to the allowance for 
credit losses as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic across multiple industry sectors. 

Year-to-date results
Net income was $7.5 billion, up 20%, with revenue more 
than offsetting higher noninterest expense and an increase 
in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $26.3 billion, up 32%.

Banking revenue was $7.6 billion, up 11%.
•  Investment Banking revenue was $4.3 billion, up 22%, 
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 29%, 
reflecting higher debt and equity underwriting fees, 
partially offset by lower advisory fees, as well as $161 
million of net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, 

32

including unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing 
portfolio. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global 
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
–  Debt underwriting fees were $2.3 billion, up 34%, 

driven by increased industry-wide fees and wallet share 
gains in investment-grade bonds, and for high-yield 
bonds, after the markets stabilized in the second 
quarter of 2020.

–  Equity underwriting fees were $1.3 billion, up 70%, 

driven by both increased industry-wide fees and wallet 
share gains primarily in follow-on offerings and 
convertible securities markets.

–  The increased activity in debt and equity 

underwriting reflected clients seeking access to 
liquidity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

–  Advisory fees of $1.1 billion were down 5%, driven by 

lower number of completed transactions.

•  Wholesale payments revenue was $2.7 billion, down 4%, 

driven by a reporting re-classification for certain 
expenses which are now reported as a reduction of 
revenue in Merchant Services. In addition, the impact of 
higher balances and fee growth was predominantly offset 
by deposit margin compression.

•  Lending revenue was $620 million, up 20%, driven by 
higher net interest income on higher loan balances, as 
well as higher fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $18.7 billion, up 
44%. Markets revenue was $16.9 billion, up 56%.
•  Fixed Income Markets revenue was $12.3 billion, up 
66%, driven by strong client activity across products 
primarily in Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and 
Credit.

•  Equity Markets revenue was $4.6 billion, up 33%, driven 
by strong client activity in derivatives and Cash Equities.

•  Securities Services revenue was $2.2 billion, up 5%, 

predominantly driven by deposit balance and fee growth 
partially offset by deposit margin compression.
•  Credit Adjustments & Other was a net loss of $441 
million, predominantly driven by losses on certain 
components of fair value option elected liabilities, as well 
as the impact of funding spread widening on derivatives

Noninterest expense was $12.7 billion, up 12%, 
predominantly driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was $3.4 billion, compared 
with $87 million in the prior year. The increase was 
predominantly driven by net additions to the allowance for 
credit losses as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic across multiple industry sectors.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
60-79 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77-78 for 
further discussions of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes select income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 
and 7 for a description of the composition of these income 
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page 69 
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further 
information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of 
principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized 
upon executing new transactions.

CIB Markets had one loss day in the second quarter of 2020 and three loss days for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Loss days represent the number of 
days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days determined under 
this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk 
Management value-at-risk (“VaR”) measure and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a 
particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 80-82

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB and the revenue and expense of the business is reported across 
CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationship. In conjunction with this realignment, treasury services product revenue has been renamed wholesale 
payments. Prior-period revenue and expense amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a)  In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and commissions (which are included in all other 

income) to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b)  Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income tax credits related to equity investments in designated community development 

entities and in entities established for rehabilitation of historic properties, as well as tax-exempt income related to municipal financing activities of $80 
million and $100 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $161 million and $194 million for the six months ended 
June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $691 million, driven by an increase in the 
provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.4 billion, up 5%. Net interest income 
was $1.6 billion, down 5%, driven by lower deposit margin, 
largely offset by higher deposit and loan balances. 
Noninterest revenue was $815 million, up 31%, driven by a 
gain on a strategic investment, higher deposit related fees, 
and investment banking revenue, partially offset by lower 
card income predominantly due to lower volumes as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense was $899 million, down 3%, driven by 
lower structural expense. 

The provision for credit losses was $2.4 billion, compared 
with $29 million in the prior year. The increase was driven 
by net additions to the allowance for credit losses as a 
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across 
multiple industry sectors. 

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $544 million, driven by an increase in the 
provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 3%. Net interest 
income was $3.1 billion, down 6%, driven by lower deposit 
margin largely offset by higher deposit and loan balances. 
Noninterest revenue was $1.4 billion, up 6%, driven by 
higher deposit related fees and a gain on a strategic 
investment, largely offset by lower card income primarily

due to lower volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and a $57 million mark down of a held-for-sale position.

Noninterest expense was $1.9 billion, relatively flat, driven 
by investments in the business largely offset by lower 
structural expense. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.4 billion, compared 
with $119 million in the prior year. The increase was driven 
by net additions to the allowance for credit losses as a 
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across 
multiple industry sectors.

CB product revenue consists of the following:

Lending includes a variety of financing alternatives, which are 
primarily provided on a secured basis; collateral includes receivables, 
inventory, equipment, real estate or other assets. Products include 
term loans, revolving lines of credit, bridge financing, asset-based 
structures, leases, and standby letters of credit.

Wholesale payments includes revenue from a broad range of products 
and services that enable CB clients to manage payments and receipts, 
as well as invest and manage funds.

Investment banking includes revenue from a range of products 
providing CB clients with sophisticated capital-raising alternatives, as 
well as balance sheet and risk management tools through advisory, 
equity underwriting, and loan syndications. Revenue from Fixed 
Income and Equity Markets products used by CB clients is also 
included. 

Other product revenue primarily includes tax-equivalent adjustments 
generated from Community Development Banking activities and 
certain income derived from principal transactions.

Quarterly results
Net income was $658 million, down 8%.

Net revenue was $3.6 billion, up 1%. Net interest income 
was $890 million, up 2%, reflecting higher deposit and loan 
balances, offset by deposit margin compression. 
Noninterest revenue was $2.7 billion, up 1%, as a result of 
increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven 
volume partially offset by lower asset management fees as 
a shift in the mix toward lower yield products was 
predominantly offset by strong net inflows into liquidity 
products over the past year.

Revenue from Asset Management of $1.8 billion, was flat 
versus the prior year.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $1.8 billion, up 3%, 
driven by higher deposit and loan balances, as well as 
increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven 
volume, largely offset by deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense of $2.5 billion was down 3%, as lower 
structural as well as volume-and revenue-related expense, 
were partially offset by higher investments.

(a)  Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $63 million and $81 million for the three months ended June 

30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $124 million and $167 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(b)  Included a net legal benefit of $(12) million and $(67) million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $(32) million and 

$(157) million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Quarterly results
Net loss was $568 million compared with net income of 
$828 million in the prior year. 

Year-to-date results
Net loss was $693 million compared with net income of 
$1.1 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $754 million, down $1.1 billion, 
driven by lower net interest income on lower rates. The 
current quarter also included small net gains on certain 
legacy private equity investments compared to losses in the 
prior year.

Noninterest expense of $147 million was down $85 million 
due to lower structural expense, partially offset by a lower 
net legal benefit compared to the prior year.

The current period income tax benefit was predominantly  
driven by the change in the level and mix of income and 
expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes. 
The prior period included tax benefits of $742 million 
related to the resolution of certain tax audits.

Net revenue was a loss of $588 million, compared with 
$747 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by 
lower net interest income on lower rates, partially offset by 
higher noninterest revenue primarily due to higher net 
investment securities gains reflecting the impact of 
repositioning the investment securities portfolio.

Noninterest expense of $293 million was down $150 
million due to lower structural expense, partially offset by a 
lower net legal benefit compared to the prior year.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by the 
change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject 
to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes as well as other tax 
adjustments, partially offset by the impact of the Firm’s 
estimated full-year expected tax rate relative to the level of 
year-to-date pretax income. The prior period included tax 
benefits of $825 million related to the resolution of certain 
tax audits.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects 
the safety and soundness of the Firm. 

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 

•  Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 

escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm; 

•  Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 

management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 

•  Firmwide structures for risk governance. 

The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to 
enhance controls, ongoing employee training and 
development, talent retention, and other measures. The 
Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 

Risk governance and oversight framework
The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight 
framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of 
risks, and impacts of risks.

Refer to pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K 
for a further discussion of Firmwide risk management 
governance and oversight.

48

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions. 

Refer to pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K, Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for further discussion of the Firm’s 
Capital Risk Management, including capital planning and 
stress testing.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm has been impacted by recent market events as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but remains well-
capitalized. However, the continuation or further 
deterioration of the current macroeconomic environment 
could result in impacts to the Firm’s capital and leverage 
position. 

Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies (“BHC”) 
and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository 
institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-
balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, 
weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based 
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated 
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced 
approaches. 

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios are 
currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced-risk-
based ratios. 

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach 
banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the 
SLR. Refer to SLR on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments
Current Expected Credit Losses. As disclosed in the Firm’s 
2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the 
January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to 
retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% 
per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response 
to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 
2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final 
rule that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on 
regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year 
transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”).

49

The interim final rule provides a uniform approach for 
estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy 
incurred loss model during the first two years of the 
transition period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby 
the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of the change 
in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on 
PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at 
December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 
capital as well as the $2.7 billion day 1 impact, will be 
phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning 
January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL 
capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period 
ended June 30, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm 
exclude $6.5 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact 
to retained earnings and 25% of the $15.7 billion increase 
in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on 
PCD loans).  

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions on Tier 
2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage 
exposure have also been incorporated into the Firm’s 
capital metrics. Refer to Note 1 for further information on 
the CECL accounting guidance. 

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. On March 18, 
2020, the Federal Reserve established the MMLF facility, 
authorized through September 30, 2020, to enhance the 
liquidity and functioning of money markets. On July 28, 
2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it was extending 
the MMLF through December 31, 2020. Under the MMLF, 
the FRBB makes nonrecourse advances to participating 
financial institutions to purchase certain types of assets 
from eligible money market mutual fund clients. These 
assets, which are reflected in other assets on the Firm’s 
Consolidated balance sheets, are pledged to the FRBB as 
collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies 
issued an interim final rule to neutralize the effects of 
purchasing assets through the program on risk-based and 
leverage-based capital ratios. As of June 30, 2020, the Firm 
excluded assets purchased from money market mutual fund 
clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under 
the MMLF in the amount of $3.8 billion from its RWA and 
$7.8 billion from adjusted average assets and total leverage 
exposure. 

Supplementary leverage ratio temporary revision. On April 1, 
2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that 
requires, on a temporary basis, the calculation of total 
leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for 
bank holding companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet 
amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal 
Reserve Banks. These exclusions became effective April 1, 
2020, and will remain in effect through March 31, 2021.  

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued 
an interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an 
option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain 

restrictions. As of June 30, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. has not elected to apply this exclusion.

Paycheck Protection Program. On April 13, 2020, the federal 
banking agencies issued an interim final rule to neutralize 
the regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP on 
risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk 
weight to loans originated under the program. As of June 
30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion of loans 
under the program. 

The interim rule also provides that if the PPP loan is 
pledged as collateral for a non-recourse loan under the 
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending 
(“PPPL”) Facility, the PPP loans can be excluded from 
leverage-based capital ratios. As of June 30, 2020, the Firm 
had not participated in the PPPL Facility. 

Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 
Pandemic on pages 11-12 for additional information on 

regulatory actions and significant financing programs that 
the U.S. government and regulators have introduced to 
address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stress Capital Buffer. On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve 
issued the final rule introducing the SCB framework for the 
Basel III Standardized approach that is designed to more 
closely integrate the results of the quantitative assessment 
in the annual CCAR with the ongoing minimum capital 
requirements for BHCs under the U.S. Basel III rules. The 
final rule replaces the static 2.5% CET1 capital 
conservation buffer in the Standardized approach with a 
dynamic institution-specific SCB. The final rule does not 
apply to the Advanced approach capital requirements. The 
SCB requirement for BHCs will be effective on October 1 of 
each year and is expected to remain in effect until 
September 30 of the following year. 

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and 
Advanced Approaches. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further

Planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
On June 29, 2020, the Firm announced that it had 
completed the 2020 CCAR stress test process. The Firm’s 
indicative SCB requirement is 3.3% and the Federal 
Reserve will provide the Firm with its final SCB requirement 
by August 31, 2020. The SCB requirement will become 
effective on October 1, 2020 and will remain in effect until 
September 30, 2021. The SCB will be integrated into the 
Firm’s ongoing Standardized risk-based capital 
requirements, increasing the minimum CET1 capital ratio to 
11.3% (up from 10.5%). 

The Federal Reserve has determined that changes in 
financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could have a material effect on a firm’s 
risk profile and financial condition and therefore is 
requiring all large bank holding companies, including the 
Firm, to update and resubmit their capital plans later this 
year. 

Refer to Key Regulatory Developments on pages 49-50 of 
this Form 10-Q and capital planning and stress testing on 
pages 85-86 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for 
additional information.

Capital actions
Preferred stock 
Preferred stock dividends declared were $401 million and 
$822 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2020. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Firm did 
not issue or redeem any preferred stock. Refer to Note 18 
of this Form 10-Q and Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s 
preferred stock, including the issuance and redemption of 
preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 
2020.

Common stock dividends 
The Firm’s quarterly common stock dividend is currently 
$0.90 per share. The Firm intends to maintain the quarterly 
common stock dividend for the third quarter of 2020 
subject to the approval of the Board of Directors. 

Common equity 
On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common 
equity. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve directed all large 
bank holding companies, including the Firm, to discontinue 
net share repurchases, at least through the end of the third 
quarter of 2020. 

The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. Refer to pages 93–98 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk Management.

LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of 
unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) that is 
sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over 
a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. 
Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% 
minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to 
non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s 
reported HQLA. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 
100%. Refer to page 94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for 
additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.

The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for 
the three months ended June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 
and June 30, 2019 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the 
finalized LCR framework.

(a)  Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal 

Reserve Banks. 

(b)  Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, 
and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c)  HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or 
purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment 
securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(d)  Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are 

not transferable to non-bank affiliates. 

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months 
ended June 30, 2020, compared with the three-month 
period ended March 31, 2020, largely due to long-term 
debt issuances and a benefit from the return of funding to 
the Parent Company from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a 
result of the bank’s strong liquidity position. Liquidity in 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the quarter 
primarily due to deposits net of loan growth. Deposits 
increased in the second quarter as a result of market 
conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 
effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve, in response 

55

to the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced reserve requirements 
to zero percent, which increased JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A.’s average HQLA by approximately $25 billion in the 
second quarter. However, these increases in excess liquidity 
in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are excluded from the Firm’s 
reported LCR under the LCR rule. Refer to Note 21 for 
additional information.

The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months 
ended June 30, 2020, compared with the prior year period, 
primarily due to an increase in the average amount of 
reportable HQLA as a result of increased cash from 
unsecured long-term debt issuances.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, 
due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows 
as a result of ongoing business activity. 

Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, 
the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as 
equity securities and fixed income debt securities, that the 
Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This 
includes securities included as part of the excess HQLA at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-
bank affiliates, as described above. The fair value of these 
securities was approximately $606 billion and $315 billion 
as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, 
although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would 
be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair 
value increased compared to December 31, 2019, due to an 
increase in excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
which was primarily a result of increased deposits as noted 
above. 

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs 
and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a 
result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $281 billion and $322 billion as of June 30, 
2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Bank discount window and other central banks. Available 
borrowing capacity decreased from December 31, 2019 
primarily due to lower credit card receivable balances and 
lower collateral values due to a decline in their fair value, 
both driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although available, 
the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other 
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.  

Funding 
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-
term secured borrowings, through the issuance of 
Deposits

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the 
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company 
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily 
funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-
term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term 
liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity 
risk characteristics.

(a)  In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The prior-   

period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

Average deposits increased for the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across 
the LOBs primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as 
customers and clients looked to remain liquid as a result of 
market conditions. In the wholesale businesses, the inflows 
principally occurred in March, and in general were 
maintained through the second quarter. In CCB, the increase 
was driven by the continued growth in both existing and 
new accounts, as well as COVID-19 related factors, such as 
the government stimulus for consumers and small 
businesses, lower consumer spending and delays in tax 
payments.

Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment 
Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on 
pages 24-47 and pages 18-19, respectively, for further 
information on deposit and liability balance trends.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the 
loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of 
total liabilities, as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 
2019.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances, over time. However, during 
periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

and Note 22 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on preferred stock and common stockholders’ equity.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly by 
high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued 
debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold 
under agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2020, 
compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting in CIB, a net 
increase related to client-driven market-making activities, and 
higher secured financing of trading assets, partially offset by a 
decline in the Firm's participation in the Federal Reserve's 
open market operations, and in Treasury and CIO, higher 
secured financing of AFS investment securities. 

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of 
the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and market-
making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

As of June 30, 2020, the Firm participated in the MMLF 
government facility. The secured nonrecourse advances under 
the MMLF are included in other borrowed funds. Refer to 
Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 for additional 
information on the MMLF. 

57

The PDCF was established by the Federal Reserve on March 20, 
2020, to allow primary dealers to support smooth market 
functioning by facilitating the availability of credit to 
businesses and households. Under the PDCF, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) provides collateralized 
financing on a term basis to primary dealers. These financing 
transactions were reported as securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase. On July 28, 2020, the Federal 
Reserve announced that it was extending through December 
31, 2020 the PDCF, which was previously scheduled to expire 
on or around September 30, 2020. The Firm participated in 
the PDCF in the first quarter of 2020, and ceased its 
participation in May 2020 as the secured financing market 
normalized.  

The Firm also continues to participate in the Federal Reserve’s 
open market operations.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily 
consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper. The 
decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2020, from 
December 31, 2019 and for the average three and six months 
ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period, was 
due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity 
management.

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is 
driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding 
proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes 
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional 
information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further description of the client-driven loan securitizations.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, 
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs on page 21, and 
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 
5 for additional information on the impact of a credit 
ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, 
and on derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of June 30, 2020 were as

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk,
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk. Refer to 
pages 60-78 for a further discussion of Credit Risk.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO

Refer to page 79 for a further discussion of Investment 
Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk 
Management on pages 100–118 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s Credit and 
Investment Risk Management framework.

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.

policies on loan modifications and the allowance for credit 
losses.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL 
accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in 
the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD 
loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, 
the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related 
commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card 
portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to 
align with the methodology applied when determining the 
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to 
conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for 
further information.

The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to 
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. 
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan 
modifications have not been considered TDRs as:

• 

• 

they represent short-term or other insignificant 
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan 
modification assessments or the IA Statement guidance, 
or

the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the 
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided 
under section 4013 of the CARES Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of 
the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. The 
Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued 
interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan 
modifications in its allowance for credit losses. Refer to 
Business Developments on pages 9-10 for more information 
on customer and client assistance granted. Refer to Notes 
12 and 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting 

The effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping borrowers 
recover and in mitigating the Firm’s credit losses remains 
uncertain in light of the unpredictable nature and duration 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Assistance provided in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of 
delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for 
those customers and clients who would have otherwise 
moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 and Wholesale 
Credit Portfolio on pages 67-76 for information on loan 
modifications as of June 30, 2020. 
In the following tables, reported loans include loans 
retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and 
certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following 
tables do not include loans which the Firm accounts for at 
fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 
and 3 for further information regarding these loans. Refer 
to Notes 12, 23, and 5 for additional information on the 
Firm’s loans, lending-related commitments and derivative 
receivables, including the Firm’s accounting policies.

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk 
inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and 
refer to Note 11 for information regarding the credit risk 
inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 and Note 12 for 
further discussions of the consumer credit environment and 
consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on 
pages 67-76 and Note 12 for further discussions of the 
wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.

Paycheck Protection Program
The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by 
the SBA, provides the Firm with delegated authority to 
process and originate PPP loans until August 8, 2020. When 
certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to 
forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the 
forgiveness amount from the SBA. The term for PPP loans 
issued before June 5, 2020 is two years (with an option to 
extend to five years) and five years for those originated on 
or after June 5, 2020. PPP loan terms provide borrowers 
with an automatic payment deferral of principal and 
interest. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, 
the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on 
these loans. PPP processing fees are deferred and accreted 
into interest income over the contractual life of the loans. 

At June 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion 
of loans under the PPP, of which $20 billion and $8 billion 
are in Consumer and Wholesale, respectively. The impact on 
interest income related to PPP loans was not material for 
the three months ended June 30, 2020.

(d)  At June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets 

excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $561 million and $961 million, respectively, 
and real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S. government agencies of 
$13 million and $41 million, respectively. These amounts have been 
excluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the 
Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed 
on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”).
(e)  At June 30, 2020, nonperforming loans included $1.3 billion of PCD 
loans on nonaccrual status. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual 
loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on 
each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, scored auto and 
business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime 
segment of the consumer credit market. Refer to Note 12 for further information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s 
nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 23 for further information on lending-related commitments.

Continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an additional 
increase in the allowance for credit losses. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 
macroeconomic environment and the extent to which customer assistance and government stimulus efforts are effective could 
result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.

The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the scored credit portfolios held in CCB, AWM 
and Corporate.

(a)  Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in Corporate.
(b)  At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, excluded operating lease assets of $22.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. These operating lease assets are 

included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 17 for further information.

(c)  Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(d)  At June 30, 2020, included $19.9 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not 

expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e)  Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available lines of credit for these products. The Firm 
has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain 
conditions are met, home equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing 
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 23 for further information.

(f)  Includes billed interest and fees.
(g)  Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(h)  At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of 

$561 million and $961 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, 
the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC.

(i)  At June 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.3 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm 

recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

(j)  Generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
(k)  Average consumer loans held-for-sale were $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were $2.2 
billion and $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/
(recovery) rates.

Consumer assistance
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the 
form of payment deferrals.

Predominantly all accounts that requested payment assistance were less than 30 days past due at the time of enrollment. 
Although borrowers are not required to make payments while still under payment deferral, on approximately 50% of accounts 
with payment assistance offered, borrowers have made at least one payment between March 2020 and June 30, 2020. The Firm 
continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing 
basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments.

The following table presents information related to the $28 billion unpaid principal balance of retained loans still under payment 
deferral as of June 30, 2020.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loan balances increased from December 31, 2019 due to 
PPP loan originations in Business Banking, partially offset 
by lower residential real estate loans, reflecting paydowns 
and loan sales. 

Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly 
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of 
credit. The portfolio decreased from December 31, 2019 
driven by paydowns and loan sales in Home Lending, largely 
offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have 
been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the 
three months ended June 30, 2020 were lower when 
compared with the same period in the prior year as the 
current quarter included losses associated with the 
purchased credit deteriorated portfolio as a result of the 
adoption of CECL. Net recoveries for the six months ended 
June 30, 2020 were higher when compared with the same 
period in the prior year as the current year benefited from a 
recovery on a loan sale.

The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $26.5 billion at June 30, 2020. This 
amount included $9.9 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $8.7 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

At June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the carrying 
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans was $23.2 
billion and $22.5 billion, respectively. These loans have an 
interest-only payment period generally followed by an 
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the three and six 
months ended June 30, 2020 was in line with the 
performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio 
for the same period.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed 
by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale. 
The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential 
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the 
allowance for loan losses.

government agency (i.e., Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in the table 
above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in 
accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back 
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform 
become subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for additional 
information about sales of loans in securitization transactions with 
Ginnie Mae.

(b)  At June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans included 

$2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of TDRs for which the 
borrowers were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on 
nonaccrual status.

(c)  At June 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.0 billion of PCD loans. 

Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as 
the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each 
of the pools was performing. 

(d)  Amount represents the unpaid principal balance of modified PCI loans 
at December 31, 2019, which were moved to retained loans upon the 
adoption of CECL.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio 
predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto and 
business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio 
increased when compared with December 31, 2019, 
predominantly due to PPP loan originations of $21.5 billion 
in Business Banking of which $19.9 billion remained 
outstanding on June 30, 2020, partially offset by paydowns 
and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans. The 
scored auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.39% and 
0.36% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 
2019, respectively, and 0.40% and 0.43% for the six 
months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans
The following tables provide credit-related information for 
PCD loans, which were accounted for as PCI loans prior to 
the adoption of CECL. PCI loans are considered PCD loans 
under CECL and are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and

consumer, excluding credit card portfolio’s residential real 
estate class. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Credit card
Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2019 
reflecting a decline in sales volume beginning in March as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of 
seasonality. The June 30, 2020 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 1.71% and 0.93%, respectively, 
decreased compared to the December 31, 2019 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and 0.95%, 
respectively. The delinquency rate was positively impacted 
by loans in payment deferral programs, as these loans are 
generally not considered delinquent if they are performing 
according to their modified terms. Net charge-offs 
decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 
compared with the same period in the prior year due to 
higher recoveries. However, net charge-offs increased for 
the six months ended June 30, 2020 when compared with 
the same period in the prior year due to loan growth in the 
prior year largely offset by higher recoveries.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and 
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

Modifications of credit card loans
At June 30, 2020 the Firm had $1.4 billion of credit card 
loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, which 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered TDRs, compared to 
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information about loan modification programs to 
borrowers.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk 
primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, 
and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating services 
(such as cash management and clearing activities), securities 
financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of 
the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale 
businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The 
Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it 
originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan 
business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit 
risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by 
conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality 
and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where 
applicable, and of industry, product and client 
concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 
70-74 for further information.

The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business 
banking and auto dealer exposures held in CCB for which the 
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the 
allowance for credit losses.

The macroeconomic environment, driven by the impacts of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in broad-based 
deterioration and an increase in the allowance for credit 
losses. In the six months ended June 30, 2020, the 
investment-grade percentage of the portfolio decreased from 
74% to 72%, and criticized exposure increased $24.3 billion 
from $15.1 billion to $39.4 billion.  The increase in criticized 
exposure was largely driven by downgrades in Consumer & 
Retail and Oil & Gas. The continuation or worsening of the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic 
environment could result in further impacts to credit quality 
metrics, including investment-grade percentages, as well as 
to criticized and nonperforming exposures and charge-offs.

Retained loans increased by $35.1 billion in the six months 
ended June 30, 2020, driven by the CIB and CB, 
predominantly to commercial and industrial clients. The 
$35.1 billion increase reflects the outstanding loans from the 
March drawdown activity on committed revolving credit 
facilities, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 
impact of loans under the PPP.

(a)  Receivables from customers and other include $22.4 billion and $33.7 
billion of brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables 
at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, to clients in 
CIB and AWM; these are classified in accrued interest and accounts 
receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(b)  Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold 
through credit derivatives used to manage both performing and 
nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not 
qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit 
derivatives on page 76 and Note 5 for additional information.
(c)  Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit 
risk management framework. As of June 30, 2020, predominantly all 
of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale assistance 
In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly in the 
form of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.

As of June 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $17 billion of retained loans still under payment deferral, almost all short-
term, and included $8.8 billion in Automotive in the table below that the Firm proactively offered to performing auto dealer 
clients where the deferral period ended on June 30, 2020, and the majority of the clients returned to their original loan terms. 
The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on 
an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments.

(a)  Excludes $6.5 billion of loans which were previously under payment deferral, with the majority returning to their original loan terms prior to June 30, 

2020.

(b)  Represents the balance of the retained loans which were still under payment deferral as of June 30, 2020, divided by the respective industry total retained 

loans balance as of June 30, 2020.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both payment 
deferrals and covenant modifications, have not resulted in an increase in TDRs, either because the modifications were 
insignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided under 
section 4013 of the CARES Act. These loans continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk 
management framework. As of June 30, 2020, predominantly all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of June 30, 
2020, and December 31, 2019. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a)  Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio, and loans at fair value.
(b)  These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c)  The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference 

entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used 
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties.

(d)  The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is based on the remaining contractual maturity. Derivative 
contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2020, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market 
conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of 
its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 
Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking 
regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist 
of the special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. 

The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding 
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $39.4 billion 
at June 30, 2020, compared with $15.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019, with increases largely driven by 
downgrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas due to 
impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loans
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans to a 
variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 12 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual 
loan portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 
2019. The increase in nonaccrual loans during the six 
months ended June 30, 2020 was driven by downgrades 
across multiple industries on client credit deterioration.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $74.8 billion and $49.8 
billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from market 
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value 
of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral 
held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the 
appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take 
into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. 
government and agency securities and other Group of Seven 
nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash 
collateral held by the Firm aggregating $21.5 billion and 
$16.0 billion at June 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, that may be used as security when the fair 
value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. 

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the table above, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair 
value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit 
enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements.

Lending-related commitments 
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. 
The contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 23 for further information on wholesale lending-
related commitments.

Receivables from Customers
Receivables from customers primarily represent held-for-
investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and 
AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the 
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such 
generally no allowance for credit losses is held against 
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm 
establishes margin requirements and monitors the required 
margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to 
deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce 
positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported 
within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the 
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and 
commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of derivative contracts.

receivables for the periods presented.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to 
mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s 
over-the-counter  derivative  contracts  subject  to  collateral 
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which 
are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their 
short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled 
daily — was approximately 87% and 90% at June 30, 2020,  
and December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management” activities). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.

In the first and second quarters of 2020, the Firm’s central 
case assumptions reflected forecasted U.S. unemployment

In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm placed significant 
weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more 
punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case 
assumptions above, resulting in weighted average U.S. 
unemployment rates remaining in double digits through the 
first half of 2021.

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will 
be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods. 

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 88-90 for further information on the allowance for 
credit losses and related management judgments.

Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66, 
Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 67-76 and Note 12 for 
additional information on the consumer and wholesale 
credit portfolios.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL 
accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance 
established a single allowance framework for all financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance 
sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that 
management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the 
instrument’s remaining expected life and considers 
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. 
Refer to Note 1 for further information.

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses comprises:

•  the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the balance sheet,

•  the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the balance sheet in accounts payable and 
other liabilities, and

•  the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is 
recognized within Investment Securities on the balance 
sheet.

Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 for a description of the 
policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine 
the Firm’s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-
related commitments, and investment securities.

The allowance for credit losses increased compared with 
December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting the deterioration 
and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a 
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting 
of:

•  a $8.7 billion addition in consumer, predominantly in the 

credit card and residential real estate portfolios

•  a net  $7.0 billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs  

impacting multiple industry sectors, and

•  a net $4.3 billion addition as a result of the adoption of 

CECL.

The increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending-
related commitments was primarily driven by an increase in 
the provision for credit losses, reflecting the deterioration 
in and uncertainty around the future macroeconomic 
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. In the first quarter of 2020, management’s 
macroeconomic forecast included a decline in the U.S. real 
GDP of approximately 25% and an increase in the U.S. 
unemployment rate to above 10%, both in the second 
quarter, followed by a solid recovery in the second half of 
2020. In the second quarter of 2020, based on the 
increased uncertainty around the duration and depth of the 
downturn and speed of economic recovery, the Firm’s 
central case reflected a more protracted downturn with a 
slower recovery of U.S. real GDP. 

77

The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered PCD 
loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related 
commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the 
methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current 
presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a)  Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated 
losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan 
was removed from a pool.

(b)  Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that 

have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably 
expected to be modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c)  The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.
(d)  Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $23 million and a provision for credit losses of $13 million as of and for the six 

months ended June 30, 2020.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm’s balance sheet or asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly 
invested in high-quality securities. At June 30, 2020, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of 
allowance for credit losses, was $556.7 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
page 46 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 80-84 for

portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
55-59 for further information on related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk
Principal investments are typically private non-traded 
financial instruments representing ownership or other 
forms of junior capital and span multiple asset classes. 
These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. In 
general, new principal investments include tax-oriented 
investments, as well as investments made to enhance or 
accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs 
and Corporate and are reflected within their respective 
financial results. The carrying values of the principal 
investment portfolios have not been significantly affected 
by recent market events as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic. However, the duration and severity of adverse 
macroeconomic conditions could subject certain principal 
investments to impairments, write-downs, or other negative 
impacts.

As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the 
aggregate carrying values of the principal investment 
portfolios were $24.5 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively, 
which included tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable 
housing and alternative energy investments) of $18.5 
billion and $18.2 billion respectively, and private equity, 
various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of $6.0 
billion at the end of both periods.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities 
held for both the short and long term. Refer to Market Risk 
Management on pages 119–126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk 
Management organization, market risk measurement, risk 
monitoring and control, and predominant business 
activities that give rise to market risk. 

COVID-19 Pandemic   
Market Risk Management is actively monitoring the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk exposures by 
leveraging existing risk measures and controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and may be limited in their ability to measure 
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur, such as those observed during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 87.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time. This is increasingly 
important in periods of sustained, heightened market 
volatility.  

Value-at-risk 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.  

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this 
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely 
aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs 
and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, 
provides the appropriate information needed to respond to 
risk events. The Firm calculates separately a daily 
aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules 
(“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s 
regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. 

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques 
and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may 
affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to 
Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 135 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.

Refer to page 121 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding VaR, including the inherent 
limitations, and the key differences between Risk 
Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to JPMorgan 
Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures 
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website at:
(http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm) 
for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other 
components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm 
(e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and 
the respective backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on 
pages 124-126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for 
further information regarding nonstatistical market risk 
measures used by the Firm.

(a)  Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 

of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.  

(b)  The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification 

benefit is not meaningful.

Generally, average VaR across the risk types and LOBs was higher due to increased volatility, which occurred at the end of the 
first quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been incorporated into average VaR results for the entirety of the 
second quarter of 2020.  

Results
Average total VaR increased by $71 million and $84 million 
for the three months ended June 30, 2020 when compared 
with the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, 
respectively. This increase was driven by the substantial 
increase in volatility in the one-year historical look-back 
period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most 
significant impacts were reflected in the fixed income and 
commodities risk types.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of 
VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of 
interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit 
spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included 
these positions in other sensitivity-based measures. In the 
absence of this refinement, the average Total VaR and each 
of the components would have been different by the 
amounts reported in the following table:

VaR backtesting 
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s 
revenue results as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new 
transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation 
adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains 
and losses on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for 
backtesting under Basel III capital rules.

The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for the 12 
months ended June 30, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk 
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the 
Firm’s covered positions.

For the 12 months ended June 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 142 of the 260 days, and observed 16 VaR 
backtesting exceptions, which was higher than the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions due to recent 
market volatility being materially higher than the levels realized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. For the 
three months ended June 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 38 of the 65 days, and observed two VaR 
backtesting exceptions as higher volatility became fully embedded in the look-back period used for the VaR calculation. 
Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, 
as disclosed in the CIB Markets revenue results, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and 
due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more 
information on CIB Markets revenue results, refer to page 36 .

Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension 
of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing 
debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio. 
Refer to the table on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 
Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying 
positions included in earnings-at-risk.

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is 
through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long 
term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude 
other positions in risk management VaR and other 
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 120 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 
months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term 
and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield 
curve involving holding short-term rates constant and 
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve 
involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term 
rates constant. These scenarios consider many different 
factors, including:

•  The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 

changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

•  Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 

prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not 
include assumptions about actions that could be taken by 
the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate 
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based 
on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with 
underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, 
and other factors which are updated periodically based 
on historical experience.

•  The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized 
deposit betas which represent the amount by which 
deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in 
market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates 
paid in these scenarios may differ from actual deposit 
rates paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to 
repricing lags and other factors.

83

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other 
factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate 
exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a 
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to 2020 
Outlook on page 8 for additional information).

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table 
below.

(0.9)

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of June 
30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 reflected 
updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and 
long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the 
Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets 
repricing at a faster pace than deposits.

Based upon current and implied market rates as of June 30, 
2020, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in 
negative interest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an 
interest rate environment where the Federal Reserve has a 
negative interest rate policy. In a negative rate 
environment, the modeling assumptions used for certain 
assets and liabilities require additional management 
judgment.

The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the 
table below.

by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current 
levels were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at 
June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain non-traded debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential 
impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market 
variables. Refer to the table Predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, as the movement in market 
parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these 
sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Refer to pages 127–128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk 
management.

COVID-19 Pandemic
Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on countries to which the Firm 
has exposure, leveraging tailored analysis and existing 
stress testing, exposure reporting and controls.

Risk Reporting
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2020 and their 
comparative exposures as of December 31, 2019. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by country, based on the Firm’s internal country 
risk management approach, and does not represent the 
Firm’s view of any actual or potentially adverse credit 
conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to 
period due to client activity and market flows. 

The overall increase in top 20 exposures was predominantly 
driven by client activity and demand for liquidity, relative to 
the period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an 
increase in cash placements primarily with the central 
banks of Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The Firm’s Technology and Cybersecurity operations 
continue to monitor the Firm’s systems 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week including responding to threat activity 
using COVID-19 themes in phishing and other social 
engineering campaigns.

The Technology function is actively supporting the Firm’s 
response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including the Firm’s expanded use of remote collaboration 
tools and platforms. Technology diligently monitors the 
operational performance of the Firm’s infrastructure to 
support increased market volumes as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse 
outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate 
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. Refer to 
Operational Risk Management on pages 129-131 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 
Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as 
well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are 
captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement 
processes. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 
132, Conduct Risk Management on page 133, Legal Risk 
Management on page 134 and Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for more information. Details on other select examples 
of operational risks are provided below.

Business and Technology Resiliency Risk
Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the 
Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or 
telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party 
to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit 
strikes, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of 
infectious diseases or pandemics. The Firmwide resiliency 
program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its critical 
business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, 
technology and facilities) in the event of a business 
interruption, while prioritizing the health and safety 
of employees and customers. The program includes 
governance, awareness training, and testing of recovery 
strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to 
identify, assess, and manage business interruption and 
public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of the 
Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in 
maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and after 
various events.

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT 

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment 
based estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions, measurement of risk, sizing the 
allowance for credit losses, assessing regulatory capital 
requirements, conducting stress testing, and making 
business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environment is significantly different 
from the historical macroeconomic environments upon 
which the models were calibrated, as the Firm has 
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than 
in typical periods.   

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 88-90 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and Estimations 
and Model Risk Management section on page 135 of 
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments and investment securities. 
The allowance for credit losses comprises:

•  The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 

retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),

•  The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

•  The allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 

which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. 
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on 
these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and 
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect 
on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and 
geography.

88

•  Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S. 

unemployment, house price index (“HPI”) and U.S. real 
gross domestic product (“GDP”).

•  Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, 
U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, corporate credit 
spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor 
market and weak overall economic conditions that will 
continue to affect borrowers across the Firm’s consumer 
and wholesale lending portfolios. Significant judgment is 
required to estimate the severity and duration of the 
current economic downturn, as well as its potential impact 
on borrower defaults and loss severities. In particular, 
macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the 
duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and 
remain highly uncertain. It is difficult to predict exactly how 
borrower behavior will be impacted by these changes in 
economic conditions. The effectiveness of government 
support, customer assistance and enhanced unemployment 
benefits should act as mitigants to credit losses, but the 
extent of the mitigation impact remains uncertain. 

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
described on page 77 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S. 
unemployment rate through the first half of 2021, 
averaging 3.6% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with 
a peak difference of nearly 7% in the fourth quarter of 
2020; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, 
remaining nearly 4% lower at the end of the eight-quarter 

forecast, with a peak difference of nearly 5.5% in the first 
quarter of 2021; and an 11% further deterioration in the 
national HPI with a trough in the first quarter of 2022.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:

•  the Firm has placed significant weight on its adverse 

scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as 
of June 30, 2020, and accordingly, the existing allowance 
already reflects credit losses beyond those estimated 
under the central scenario

•  the changes in the MEVs are not intended to imply 

management’s expectation of the extent or nature of 
future deterioration in MEVs

•  the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 

interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in 
macroeconomic variables

•  the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs at a 

speed and to degrees not seen in recent history, adding 
significantly higher degrees of uncertainty around 
modeled credit loss estimations which use scenarios 
outside of historical experience

•  significant changes in the expected severity and duration 

of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic, the effects of government support and 
customer assistance, and the speed of the subsequent 
recovery could significantly affect the Firm’s estimate of 
expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated 
sensitivities described below.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30, 2020, the Firm 
compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse 
scenario to its central scenario. Without considering the 
additional weight the Firm has placed on its adverse 
scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in 
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses for these lending exposures, the difference 
between these two scenarios would result in the following:

•  An increase of approximately $2 billion for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments

•  An increase of approximately $4 billion for credit card 

loans

•  An increase of approximately $7 billion for wholesale 

loans and lending-related commitments

This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.

Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2020.

Fair value 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.

Assets measured at fair value
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for

(a)  For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total 

reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $8.6 billion of 
derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting 
adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on 
the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 
balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the 
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely 
dependent on the amount of observable market information 
available to the Firm. For instruments valued using 
internally developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are 

89

Credit card rewards liability
The credit card rewards liability was $7.1 billion and $6.4 
billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to 
pages 137-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a 
description of the significant assumptions and judgments 
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards liability.

Income taxes
Refer to Income taxes on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 
2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with 
the accounting for income taxes.

Litigation reserves
Refer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of JPMorgan 
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a description of the significant 
estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, 
judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant 
than those required when estimating the fair value of 
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of 
observability of certain significant inputs requires 
management to assess all relevant empirical data in 
deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction 
details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, 
default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, 
valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange 
rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including 
unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing. Refer to Goodwill 
impairment on page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 
10-K for a description of the significant valuation judgments 
associated with goodwill impairment.

Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
June 30, 2020.

certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This 
framework requires that management’s estimate 
reflects credit losses over the instrument’s 
remaining expected life and considers expected 
future changes in macroeconomic conditions.

 •  Eliminates existing guidance for PCI loans, and 

requires recognition of the nonaccretable 
difference as an increase to the allowance for 
expected credit losses on financial assets 
purchased with more than insignificant credit 
deterioration since origination, with a 
corresponding increase in the amortized cost of 
the related loans. 

 •  Requires inclusion of expected recoveries, 

limited to the cumulative amount of prior write-
offs, when estimating the allowance for credit 
losses for in scope financial assets (including 
collateral-dependent assets).

 •  Amends existing impairment guidance for AFS 

securities to incorporate an allowance, which will 
allow for reversals of credit impairments in the 
event that the credit of an issuer improves.

 •  Requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings as of the beginning of the 
reporting period of adoption.

 •  Requires recognition of an impairment loss when 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls 
below its carrying value.

 •  Eliminates the requirement that an impairment 
loss be recognized only if the estimated implied 
fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying 
value.

 •  Provides optional expedients and exceptions to 
current accounting guidance when financial 
instruments, hedging relationships, and other 
transactions are amended due to reference rate 
reform.

 •  Provides an election to account for certain 

contract amendments related to reference rate 
reform as modifications rather than 
extinguishments without the requirement to 
assess the significance of the amendments.

 •  Allows for changes in critical terms of a hedging 
relationship without automatic termination of 
that relationship. Provides various practical 
expedients and elections designed to allow 
hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted 
during the transition period.

 •  Provides a one-time election to transfer 
securities out of the held-to-maturity 
classification if certain criteria are met.
