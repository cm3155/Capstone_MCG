Business segments 

For management reporting purposes, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s activities are organized into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate segment. The Firm&#8217;s consumer business is the Consumer &#38; Community Banking (&#8220;CCB&#8221;) segment. The Firm&#8217;s wholesale business segments are the Corporate &#38; Investment Bank (&#8220;CIB&#8221;), Commercial Banking (&#8220;CB&#8221;), and Asset &#38; Wealth Management (&#8220;AWM&#8221;).

&#160;

discussion and analysis&#8221; or &#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;), beginning on page 42 and in Note 32 . 

Competition 

JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. The Firm&#8217;s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm&#8217;s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. 

Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. In some cases, the Firm&#8217;s businesses compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, and with companies that provide new or innovative products or services, including those that the Firm does not provide. 

Supervision and regulation 

The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. 

Financial holding company: 

Consolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. is a bank holding company (&#8220;BHC&#8221;) and a financial holding company (&#8220;FHC&#8221;) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Federal Reserve acts as an &#8220;umbrella regulator,&#8221; and certain of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities of those subsidiaries. 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;). 

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Part I 

(&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), and subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the &#8220;PRA&#8221;) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;). 

The Firm&#8217;s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. 

Permissible business activities . The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs can engage in a broader range of financial activities, including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC&#8217;s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC&#8217;s depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for BHCs. 

Capital and liquidity requirements . The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase and evaluates the Firm&#8217;s compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. 

In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued &#8220;Minimum capital requirements for market risk,&#8221; which supersedes a previous release from January 2016. The Basel Committee expects national regulators to implement these revised market risk requirements for banking organizations in their jurisdictions by January 1, 2022, in line with the other elements of the Basel III Reforms. 

U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III Reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S. Any changes to U.S. capital rules based on the Basel III Reforms would first be proposed for public comment. In 2018, the Federal Reserve and the OCC released a proposal to revise the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (&#8220;eSLR&#8221;) requirements applicable to the U.S. global systemically important banks (&#8220;GSIBs&#8221;) and their insured depository institutions (&#8220;IDIs&#8221;) and to make conforming changes to the rules which are applicable to U.S. GSIBs relating to total loss-absorbing capacity (&#8220;TLAC&#8221;) and external long-term 

&#160;

debt that must satisfy certain eligibility criteria. Final requirements have not yet been issued. In November 2019, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a rule implementing &#8220;Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk&#8221; (&#8220;SA-CCR&#8221;), which will be effective in April 2020 and which has a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2022. 

Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) and the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;). In 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposed rule for NSFR, but no final rule has been issued. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85&#8211;92 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93&#8211;98 . 

Stress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve each year before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory &#8220;severely adverse&#8221; scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Firm is required to file its 2020 annual CCAR submission on April 6, 2020. Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30, 2020, with disclosures of results by BHCs, including the Firm, to follow within 15 days. 

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve proposed the introduction of a stress buffer framework that would create a single, integrated set of capital requirements by combining the supervisory stress test results of the CCAR assessment and those under the Dodd-Frank Act with current point-in-time capital requirements. In December 2019, the Federal Reserve indicated that it intends to have the stress buffer framework in place for the 2020 stress tests. Final requirements have not yet been issued. 

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 85&#8211;92 for more information concerning the Firm&#8217;s CCAR. 

Enhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (&#8220;SIFIs&#8221;), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened 

##TABLE_START 2 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. Large BHCs such as JPMorgan Chase are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities. 

Resolution and recovery . The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) in the event of material distress or failure (a &#8220;resolution plan&#8221;). On December 17, 2019, the Firm received feedback from the Federal Reserve and FDIC on its 2019 resolution plan that set forth certain expectations for further enhancement of the Firm&#8217;s resolution capabilities and provided initial expectations for the Firm&#8217;s next resolution plan, but did not identify shortcomings or deficiencies. In the future, the Firm&#8217;s resolution plan submissions will alternate between &#8220;targeted&#8221; and &#8220;full&#8221; plans, with the Firm&#8217;s next &#8220;targeted&#8221; resolution plan due to be filed on or before July 1, 2021. The Firm also has a comprehensive recovery plan summarizing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to provide a resolution plan to the FDIC. The FDIC has proposed changes to its rules relating to the resolution plans of IDIs in an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. The OCC has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has submitted its recovery plan to the OCC. 

Certain of the Firm&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to local resolution and recovery planning requirements. 

Orderly liquidation authority . Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an &#8220;orderly liquidation authority.&#8221; The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority. 

Holding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160;

Regulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to multiple requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are &#8220;financial in nature.&#8221; 

Volcker Rule . The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including the Firm, from engaging in certain &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, &#8220;covered funds,&#8221; and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and covered funds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as certain covered funds controlled by such funds. The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule. In August 2019, the 

Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies finalized 

revisions to the proprietary trading restrictions of the 

Volcker Rule, including simplifications to the Volcker Rule&#8217;s framework for demonstrating compliance with the 

permitted activities under the rule. On January 30, 2020, the agencies proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule&#8217;s provisions relating to covered funds that would streamline the existing exclusion for non-U.S. public funds and introduce new exclusions for new classes of funds and from existing prohibitions on engaging in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with covered funds. 

Consent orders . The Firm remains subject to consent orders entered into with its banking regulators between 2014 and 2016 concerning foreign exchange trading and referral hiring practices. 

Subsidiary banks: 

The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm&#8217;s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8217;s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the bank. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Part I 

FDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 

FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the insolvency of an IDI, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution&#8217;s creditors. 

Prompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Although these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC , such as JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. 

OCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a bank&#8217;s risk governance framework must ensure that the bank&#8217;s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. The bank&#8217;s board or risk committee is responsible for approving the bank&#8217;s risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the bank&#8217;s risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. 

Restrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. 

Dividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2020, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank. 

&#160;

Depositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders. 

Consumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The Firm&#8217;s consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency of each state. 

Securities and broker-dealer regulation: 

The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 92 for information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc. 

Investment management regulation: 

The Firm&#8217;s asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firm&#8217;s subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. The Firm&#8217;s registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as various state securities laws. The Firm&#8217;s fiduciary activities are also subject to supervision by the OCC. 

The Firm&#8217;s asset and wealth management businesses continue to be affected by ongoing rule-making and 

##TABLE_START 4 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

implementation of new regulations, including the SEC&#8217;s Regulation Best Interest, which becomes operative on June 30, 2020, and rules proposed or adopted by certain U.S. states relating to enhanced standards of conduct for broker-dealers and certain other market participants. 

Derivatives regulation: 

The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In accordance with requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have registered with the CFTC as &#8220;swap dealers&#8221; and may be required to register with the SEC as &#8220;security-based swap dealers.&#8221; As a result, these entities are or will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. In the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&#8220;EMIR&#8221;) and substantial revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID II&#8221;) has resulted in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives. 

The Firm and other derivatives market participants have agreed to adhere to several protocols developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. These protocols provide for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and, in the case of certain of the protocols, a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights. 

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and is a member of the National Futures Association. 

Data and cyber regulation: 

The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as international laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, confidentiality, disclosure, transfer, protection and handling of information, including personal information of individuals and confidential information (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the management of internal and external threats and vulnerabilities to protect information assets and the supporting infrastructure from cyberattacks. These laws and regulations are evolving at a rapid pace, remain a focus of regulators globally and will 

&#160;

continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firm&#8217;s businesses. 

The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: 

The Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). In addition, the EU has adopted various economic sanctions programs targeted at entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations. 

Anti-Corruption: 

The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. 

Compensation practices: 

The Firm&#8217;s compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations&#8217; safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firm&#8217;s compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the EU Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (&#8220;CRD IV&#8221;), which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies which in certain countries, such as the U.K., are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices. 

Other significant international regulatory initiatives: 

The EU continues to implement an extensive and complex program of regulatory enhancement. Amendments to EMIR, known as &#8220;EMIR REFIT,&#8221; entered into force during 2019 and made targeted changes to EMIR to make the rules more streamlined and proportionate. While most of the changes already apply, some will take effect in 2020 and 2021. This will include a new requirement for clearing firms to provide clearing services on &#8220;fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent commercial terms&#8221; as well as changes to the EMIR reporting rules.

Part I 

The European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) has begun its review of MiFID II, which will continue into 2020, with the EC expected to publish a legislative proposal for changes to MiFID II. MiFID II, which became effective in 2018, requires the trading of shares and certain OTC derivatives to take place on trading venues, and also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced position limits and a reporting regime for commodities. The extent of the changes that will be proposed under the MiFID II review is not known. 

The EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment firms implemented many of the finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. These changes will begin to take effect from June 2021. The final EU legislation also includes a requirement for certain non-EU banks operating in the EU to establish an intermediate parent undertaking (&#8220;IPU&#8221;) located in the EU. The IPU rule will allow a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with &#8220;home country&#8221; bank separation rules or impede resolvability. 

The EU has also proposed or implemented significant revisions to laws covering securities settlement, mutual funds and pensions, payments, anti-money laundering controls, data security and privacy, transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions, benchmarks, and resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures, such as central counterparties.
