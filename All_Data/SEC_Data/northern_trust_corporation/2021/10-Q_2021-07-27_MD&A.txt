Items 2. and 3. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) for the second quarter of 2021. The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this report as well as the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Investors also should read the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” SECOND QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The Corporation is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its,” or similar terms mean the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. COVID-19 Pandemic and Recent Events During the COVID-19 pandemic, Northern Trust has remained focused on the health and well-being of its workforce, meeting its clients’ needs and supporting its communities. The majority of Northern Trust’s workforce continues to work remotely and the Corporation continues to adjust its response to the pandemic as needed. Plans for return-to-office (RTO) are developed on a location-by-location basis based on business unit needs. Northern Trust continues to consider site readiness, transportation options, technology capabilities, and workforce alignment. To ensure the health and well-being of Northern Trust’s workforce, clients and visitors, several social distancing practices and other protective measures, distribution of personal protective equipment, and workforce health selfcertifications, were implemented. Northern Trust provided its employees a total of two days of paid time off, if needed, to travel to, obtain and recover from COVID-19 vaccinations. Plans are underway in some locations to return portions of the workforce on a hybrid or rotational schedule in the third quarter of 2021. The timing of the RTO will be driven by business, client and operational needs, and will be guided by health and safety guidelines. During the pandemic, Northern Trust offered assistance to affected clients by lending under a government lending program and providing payment deferrals. During the second quarter of 2020, Northern Trust became a lender under the Paycheck Protection Program, as amended (PPP), which is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which works with financial institutions in providing loans to small businesses. The PPP, which is meant to aid small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, was created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The PPP Extension Act of 2021, which was enacted on March 30, 2021, extended the PPP application deadline to May 31, 2021 and provided the SBA additional time to process applications through June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, Northern Trust had outstanding loans totaling $145.4 million under the PPP and 889 applications went through the PPP loan forgiveness process and resulted in an aggregate $153.1 million of loan principal and interest being forgiven. In addition, there have been two forms of relief provided to lenders exempting certain loan modifications which would otherwise be classified as troubled debt restructuring (TDR) from such classification. Northern Trust elected to apply each of these forms of relief, when applicable, in providing borrowers with qualifying loan modifications, including payment deferrals, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these assistance measures have declined since the start of the pandemic. For further information on the PPP and TDRs, please refer to Note 6 — Loans and Leases to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Overview of Financial Results Net Income per diluted common share increased in the current quarter to $1.72 from $1.46 in the second quarter of 2020. Net Income increased $54.8 million, or 18%, to $368.1 million in the current quarter from $313.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Annualized return on average common equity was 13.7% in the current quarter and 12.2% in the prior-year quarter. The annualized return on average assets was 0.96% in the current quarter as compared to 0.91% in the prior-year quarter. Revenue increased $74.2 million to $1.58 billion in the current quarter from $1.51 billion in the prior-year quarter. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees increased $113.9 million, or 12%, from $961.5 million in the prior-year quarter to $1.08 billion in the current quarter, primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and favorable currency translation, partially offset by higher money market mutual fund fee waivers. 3 SECOND QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Overview of Financial Results (continued) Other Noninterest Income decreased $3.2 million, or 2%, from $172.5 million in the prior-year quarter to $169.3 million in the current quarter, primarily reflecting lower Other Operating Income. Net Interest Income decreased $36.5 million, or 10%, to $335.6 million in the current quarter as compared to $372.1 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a lower net interest margin, partially offset by higher average earning assets. There was a $27.0 million release of credit reserves in the current quarter, as compared to a provision of $66.0 million in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter release of credit reserves was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was driven by continued improvements in overall projected economic conditions, as well as improved industry-specific conditions, partially offset by credit deterioration associated with a limited number of commercial real estate loans and overall portfolio growth. Noninterest Expense increased $83.9 million, or 8%, from $1.04 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.12 billion in the current quarter, primarily attributable to higher Outside Services, Employee Benefits, Compensation and Equipment and Software expense, offset by lower Other Operating Expense and Occupancy expense. Employee Benefits expense included a $17.6 million pension settlement charge in the current quarter. The Provision for Income Taxes in the current quarter totaled $118.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.3%. The Provision for Income Taxes in the prior-year quarter totaled $89.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.3%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to the deferred tax impact of the UK statutory tax rate increase enacted in the current quarter and a prior-year quarter tax benefit from dispositions of leveraged leases. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. Low-interest-rate environments have historically had a negative impact on fees earned on certain products. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation began to waive a portion of certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low-interest-rate environment. Northern Trust voluntarily waived $79.2 million and $0.3 million of money market mutual fund fees for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These fee waivers, which are impacted by the level of yields earned and account balances in certain funds, are expected to continue in the current low-interest-rate environment as the yields in these funds remain insufficient to pay the stated fees associated with such funds. This is expected to adversely impact Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees within the C&IS and Wealth Management reporting segments. The components of Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are provided below. 
Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees (continued) Corporate & Institutional Services Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration (AUC/A), transaction volumes and the number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client-specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarterend, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are based generally on market values of client assets under management throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag. Custody and Fund Administration fees increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and favorable currency translation. Investment Management fees decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Securities Lending fees decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. Wealth Management Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values and is impacted by both one-month and one-quarter lagged asset values. Fee income in the regions (Central, East and West) increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to favorable markets and new business, partially offset by higher money market mutual fund fee waivers. Global Family Office fee income decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Market Indices The following tables present selected market indices and the percentage changes year over year to provide context regarding equity and fixed income market impacts on the Corporation’s results.Net Interest Income Net Interest Income is defined as the total of Interest Income and amortized fees on earning assets, less Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets—including Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due From Banks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits and Other, Securities, and Loans and Leases—are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets are also funded by noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income. Net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Net Interest Income stated on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided on page 32.Net Interest Income, stated on a FTE basis, decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a lower net interest margin, partially offset by higher average earning assets. Average earning assets increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher levels of short-term interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities. Funding of the balance sheet reflected higher levels of client deposits. The net interest margin on an FTE basis decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower average interest rates. Low levels of market interest rates are expected to continue to impact our net interest income. Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits and Other averaged $37.4 billion and increased $7.1 billion, or 24%, from $30.3 billion in the prior-year quarter, resulting from significant deposit inflows. The higher level of client deposits were primarily placed in the securities portfolio and with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Average Securities were $60.6 billion and increased $7.7 billion, or 15%, from $52.9 billion, in the prior-year quarter and include certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and Federal Reserve stock of $909.9 million, $160.1 million and $70.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Average taxable Securities were $57.5 billion in the current quarter and $47.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were $3.1 billion in the current quarterNet Interest Income (continued) and $5.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged $6.7 billion in the current quarter and $5.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. Loans and Leases averaged $36.3 billion and increased $775.4 million, or 2%, from $35.5 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher levels of private client, commercial real estate, non-U.S., and residential real estate loans, partially offset by lower levels of commercial and institutional loans. Private client loans averaged $13.5 billion and increased $1.9 billion, or 17%, from $11.6 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate loans averaged $3.8 billion and increased $652.6 million, or 21%, from $3.2 billion for the prior-year quarter. Non-U.S. loans averaged $2.6 billion and increased $355.3 million or 16%, from $2.2 billion for the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans averaged $6.2 billion and increased $91.1 million, or 1%, from $6.1 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial and institutional loans averaged $9.8 billion and decreased $2.3 billion, or 19%, from $12.1 billion for the prior-year quarter. Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased $8.5 billion, or 10%, to an average of $97.5 billion in the current quarter from $89.0 billion in the prior-year quarter. Other Average Interest-Related Funds decreased $2.1 billion, or 17%, to an average of $10.1 billion in the current quarter from $12.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Average net noninterest-related funds increased $10.4 billion, or 43%, to $34.4 billion in the current quarter from $24.0 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily resulting from higher levels of Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits. Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current quarter was driven by low and negative interest rates for Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits and low interest rates on domestic Interest-Bearing Deposits. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 71% of total average Interest-Bearing Deposits for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Provision for Credit Losses There was a $27.0 million release of credit reserves in the current quarter, as compared to a provision of $66.0 million in the prior-year quarter. The release of credit reserves in the current quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was driven by continued improvements in overall projected economic conditions, as well as improved industry-specific conditions, partially offset by credit deterioration associated with a limited number of commercial real estate loans and overall portfolio growth. The provision in the prior-year quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis driven by downgrades in the portfolio and more severe projected economic conditions at the time, both resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related market and economic impacts, with the largest increases in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios. Net recoveries in the current quarter were $3.2 million, reflecting $3.2 million of recoveries and de minimis charge-offs. The prior-year quarter included $2.6 million of net recoveries, reflecting $3.0 million of recoveries and $0.4 million of charge-offs. Nonaccrual assets of $106.7 million increased $7.3 million, or 7%, from $99.4 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Noninterest Expense (continued) Employee Benefits expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a $17.6 million pension settlement charge in the current quarter and higher medical costs. Outside Services expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher technical services costs, third-party advisory fees, sub-custodian expenses, and consulting services. Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher software support costs and amortization. Occupancy expense decreased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to rent accelerations arising from workplace real estate strategies in the prioryear quarter. Other Operating Expense decreased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower miscellaneous expenses, including account servicing activities, mutual fund co-administration fees, and supplemental compensation plan expense. The lower supplemental compensation plan expense resulted in a related decrease in miscellaneous income reported in noninterest income. Please refer to Note 17 — Other Operating Expense to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further detail. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $118.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.3%, compared to $89.9 million in the prior-year quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 22.3%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to the deferred tax impact of the UK statutory tax rate increase enacted in the current quarter and a prior-year quarter tax benefit from dispositions of leveraged leases. SIX-MONTH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Financial Results Net Income per diluted common share increased in the current period to $3.42 from $3.02 in the comparable prior-year period. Net income increased $69.3 million, or 10%, to $743.2 million in the current period from $673.9 million in the prior-year period. Annualized return on average common equity was 13.7% in the current period and 12.8% in the prior-year period. The annualized return on average assets was 0.97% in the current period compared to 1.03% in the prior-year period. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased $69.9 million, or 2%, from $3.09 billion in the prior-year period to $3.16 billion in the current period. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees increased $174.0 million, or 9%, from $1.97 billion in the prior-year period to $2.14 billion in the current period, primarily driven by favorable markets, new business, and favorable currency translation, partially offset by higher money market mutual fund fee waivers. Other Noninterest Income increased from $348.5 million in the prior-year period to $348.9 million in the current period, primarily driven by higher Other Operating Income, partially offset by lower Foreign Exchange Trading Income and Security Commissions and Trading Income. Net Interest Income decreased $104.5 million, or 13%, to $675.7 million in the current period from $780.2 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. There was a $57.0 million release of credit reserves in the current period, as compared to a provision of $127.0 million in the prior-year period. Noninterest Expense increased $135.8 million, or 6%, from $2.10 billion in the prior-year period to $2.24 billion in the current period, primarily attributable to higher Outside Services, Compensation, Employee Benefits, and Equipment and Software expense, partially offset by lower Other Operating Expense and Occupancy. Employee Benefits expense included a $17.6 million pension settlement charge in the current period. The Provision for Income Taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2021 totaled $239.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.3%. The Provision for Income Taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2020 totaled $190.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22.0%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower tax benefits related to share-based compensation, the deferred tax impact of the UK statutory tax rate increase enacted in the current period, and a prior-year-period tax benefit from dispositions of leveraged leases. 12 SIX-MONTH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation began to waive a portion of certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the lowinterest-rate environment. Northern Trust voluntarily waived $130.0 million and $0.3 million of money market mutual fund fees for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These fee waivers, which are impacted by the level of yields earned and account balances in certain funds, are expected to continue in the current low-interest-rate environment as the yields in these funds remain insufficient to pay the stated fees associated with such funds. This is expected to adversely impact Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees within the C&IS and Wealth Management reporting segments. The components of Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are provided in the table below. Corporate & Institutional Services Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, increased primarily driven by new business, favorable markets and favorable currency translation. Investment Management fees decreased primarily due to higher money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Securities Lending fees decreased primarily driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. Wealth Management Fee income in the regions (Central, East and West) increased primarily due to favorable markets, partially offset by higher money market mutual fund fee waivers. Global Family Office fee income decreased primarily due to higher money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by favorable markets and new business. Net Interest Income, stated on an FTE basis, decreased from the prior-year period, primarily due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. Average earning assets increased primarily due to higher levels of short-term interest-bearing deposits with banks, securities and loans. Funding of the balance sheet reflected higher levels of client deposits. Average non-U.S. offices interest-bearing deposits comprised 71% of total average interest-bearing deposits for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The net interest margin on an FTE basis decreased from the prior-year period, primarily due to lower average interest rates. Low levels of market interest rates are expected to continue to impact our net interest income. Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits and Other averaged $37.3 billion and increased $12.2 billion, or 49%, from $25.1 billion in the prior-year period, resulting from significant deposit inflows. The higher level of client deposits were primarily placed with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and in the securities portfolio. Average Securities were $60.9 billion and increased $8.5 billion, or 16%, from $52.4 billion in the prior-year period and include certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and Federal Reserve stock of $910.9 million, $178.2 million and $70.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Average taxable Securities were $57.5 billion in the current period and $46.9 billion in the prior-year period. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were $3.4 billion in the current period and $5.5 billion in the prior-year period. Interest-Bearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged $6.6 billion in the current period and $5.7 billion in the prior-year period. (1) (1) 16 SIX-MONTH CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Net Interest Income (continued) Loans and leases averaged $35.2 billion and increased $1.3 billion, or 4%, from $33.9 billion in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher levels of private client, commercial real estate, non-U.S., and residential real estate loans, partially offset by lower levels of commercial and institutional loans. Private client loans averaged $12.7 billion and increased $1.4 billion, or 12%, from $11.3 billion for the prior-year period. Commercial real estate loans averaged $3.7 billion and increased $622.6 million, or 20%, from $3.1 billion for the prior-year period. Non-U.S. loans averaged $2.5 billion and increased $290.8 million or 13% from $2.2 billion for the prior-year period. Residential real estate loans averaged $6.2 billion and increased $61.5 million, or 1%, from $6.1 billion for the prior-year period. Commercial and institutional loans averaged $9.8 billion and decreased $1.0 billion, or 9%, from $10.8 billion for the prior-year period. Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits increased $14.4 billion, or 17%, to an average of $96.8 billion in the current period from $82.4 billion in the prior-year period. Other Average Interest-Related Funds decreased $3.1 billion, or 24%, to an average of $9.9 billion in the current period from $13.0 billion in the prior-year period. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Average net noninterest-related funds increased $12.2 billion, or 54%, to $34.7 billion in the current period from $22.5 billion in the prior-year period primarily resulting from higher levels of Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits. Provision for Credit Losses There was a $57.0 million release of credit reserves for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a provision of $127.0 million in the prior-year period. The release of credit reserves was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was driven by continued improvements in overall projected economic conditions and portfolio quality, as well as improved industry-specific conditions, partially offset by credit deterioration associated with a limited number of commercial real estate loans and overall portfolio growth. The provision in the prior-year period was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis driven by downgrades in the portfolio and current and projected economic conditions at the time, both resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related market and economic impacts, with the largest increases in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios. In addition, a $13.7 million increase in the allowance for credit losses, with a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to decrease retained earnings of $10.1 million, net of income taxes, was recorded on January 1, 2020 upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” Net recoveries in the current-year period totaled $4.1 million resulting from $0.4 million of charge-offs and $4.5 million of recoveries, compared to net recoveries of $1.9 million in the prior-year period resulting from $2.2 million of charge-offs and $4.1 million of recoveries. Residential real estate, commercial real estate, and commercial and institutional loans accounted for 47%, 35%, and 18%, respectively, of total nonaccrual loans and leases at June 30, 2021. Residential real estate, commercial and institutional, and commercial real estate loans accounted for 65%, 32%, and 3%, respectively, of total nonaccrual loans and leases at June 30, 2020. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Asset Quality” section beginning on page 23. Noninterest Expense (continued) Employee Benefits expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to a $17.6 million pension settlement charge, higher medical costs, and higher payroll taxes. Outside Services expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher technical services costs, third-party advisory fees, and subcustodian expenses. Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to higher software support costs and amortization. Occupancy expense decreased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to rent accelerations arising from workplace real estate strategies in the prioryear period. Other Operating Expense decreased compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to lower other miscellaneous expenses and business promotion, partially offset by higher supplemental compensation plan expense. The higher supplemental compensation plan expense resulted in a related increase in miscellaneous income reported in noninterest income. Please refer to Note 17 — Other Operating Expense to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further detail. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $239.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.3%, compared to $190.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, representing an effective tax rate of 22.0%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower tax benefits related to share-based compensation, the deferred tax impact of the UK statutory tax rate increase enacted in the current period, and a prior-year-period tax benefit from dispositions of leveraged leases. REPORTING SEGMENTS Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: C&IS and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to C&IS and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to C&IS and Wealth Management. Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to C&IS and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment. Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. Effective January 1, 2021, Northern Trust implemented enhancements to its FTP methodology, including enhancements impacting the allocation of net interest income between C&IS and Wealth Management. These methodology enhancements affect the results of each of these reporting segments. Due to the lack of historical information, segment results for periods ended prior to January 1, 2021 have not been revised to reflect the methodology enhancements. 18 REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) The following table presents the earnings contributions and average assets of Northern Trust’s reporting segments for the three- and six- month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Corporate & Institutional Services (continued) For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Net Income was down from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher Noninterest Expense and lower Net Interest Income, partially offset by higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees and a release of credit reserves in the current period as compared to a provision in the prior-year period. C&IS Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of C&IS Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. C&IS Foreign Exchange Trading Income For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Foreign Exchange Trading Income decreased $11.0 million, or 7%, from the prior-year period, primarily due to lower client volumes, decreased market volatility, and lower foreign exchange swap activity. C&IS Other Noninterest Income For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Other Noninterest Income increased $18.4 million, or 17%, from the prior-year period, primarily due to higher Other Operating Income. C&IS Net Interest Income For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis decreased $12.3 million, or 7%, from the prior-year quarter and decreased $62.9 million, or 17%, from the prior-year period for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily reflected a lower net interest margin driven by declining short-term average interest rates, partially offset by higher earning asset levels funded by higher deposit balances. Average earning assets increased $14.0 billion to $109.9 billion in the current quarter from $95.9 billion in the prior-year quarter and increased $20.6 billion to $109.4 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 from $88.8 billion in the prior-year period. The earning assets and funding sources in C&IS for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 consisted primarily of intercompany assets and of loans and non-U.S. custodyrelated interest-bearing deposits, respectively. C&IS Provision for Credit Losses For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, there was a $16.8 million and $22.2 million release of credit reserves, respectively, compared with a $28.8 million and $54.5 million provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The release of credit reserves for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, reflected a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis driven by continued improvements in overall projected economic conditions and portfolio quality, as well as improved industry-specific conditions, partially offset by overall portfolio growth. C&IS Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $48.0 million, or 7%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher expense allocations, compensation expense, outside services and employee benefit expense, primarily offset by lower account servicing activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Noninterest Expense increased $101.8 million, or 8%, from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher expense allocations, compensation expense, outside services and employee benefit expense, partially offset by lower business promotion expense. Wealth Management Wealth Management Net Income For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Net Income increased $43.4 million, or 24%, from the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees and a release of credit reserves in the current quarter as compared to a provision in the prior-year quarter, partially offset by higher Noninterest Expense, lower Net Interest Income and a higher Provision for Income Taxes. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Net Income increased $74.3 million, or 20%, from the prior-year period primarily due to a release of credit reserves in the current period as compared to a provision in the prior-year period and higher Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, partially offset by lower Net Interest Income, a higher Provision for Income Taxes and higher Noninterest Expense. Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Wealth Management Net Interest Income For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis decreased $23.6 million, or 11%, from the prior-year quarter and decreased $42.5 million, or 10%, from the prior-year period for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily reflected lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Average earning assets increased $3.0 billion to $32.2 billion in the current quarter from $29.2 billion in the prior-year quarter and increased $2.8 billion to $31.9 billion in the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 from $29.1 billion in the prior-year period. Earning assets and funding sources for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interest-bearing deposits, respectively. Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, there was a $10.2 million and $34.8 million release of credit reserves, respectively, compared with a $37.2 million and $72.5 million provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The release of credit reserves for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, reflected a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis driven by continued improvement in overall projected economic conditions, partially offset by credit deterioration associated with a limited number of commercial real estate loans and overall portfolio growth. Wealth Management Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expenses of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $26.5 million or 7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher expense allocations, compensation expense and employee benefits. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Noninterest Expense increased $35.2 million, or 5%, from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher expense allocations, compensation expense, employee benefits and outside services. Other Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Other Noninterest Income remained relatively unchanged from the prior-year quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Other Noninterest Income decreased $6.4 million from the prior-year period, due to higher expenses for existing swap agreements related to Visa Inc. Class B common shares. Other Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, Other Noninterest Expense increased $9.4 million from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a $17.6 million pension settlement charge in the current quarter, partially offset by costs in the prior-year quarter associated with executing workplace real estate strategies. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, noninterest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 6%, from the prior-year period, primarily due to costs in the prior-year period associated with executing workplace real estate strategies and a one-time supplemental payment to employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a $17.6 million pension settlement charge in the current-year period. ASSET QUALITY (continued) Securities Portfolio (continued) Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. Net unrealized gains within the investment securities portfolio totaled $323.7 million at June 30, 2021, compared to net unrealized gains of $872.6 million as of December 31, 2020. Net unrealized gains as of June 30, 2021 were comprised of $581.7 million and $258.0 million of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. Net unrealized gains as of December 31, 2020 were comprised of $981.9 million and $109.3 million of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, the $36.9 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $64.7 million and $18.5 million related to government-sponsored agency and obligations of states and political subdivisions, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of December 31, 2020, the $42.0 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $26.9 million and $2.8 million related to government-sponsored agency and other asset-backed securities, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, 16% of the AFS corporate debt securities portfolio was backed by guarantees provided by U.S. and non-U.S. government entities. As of June 30, 2021, the $21.7 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $62.9 million, $37.4 million, $23.9 million and $19.0 million related to other residential mortgage-backed securities, non-U.S. government, government-sponsored agency, and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of December 31, 2020, the $17.8 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of $76.5 million related to other residential mortgage-backed securities, which is primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. HTM debt securities consist of securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, $6.86 billion of government sponsored agency securities were transferred from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes, all of which were transferred in the second quarter of 2021. Upon transfer of a debt security from the AFS to HTM classification, the amortized cost is reset to fair value. These transferred securities had a net unrealized gain of $120.1 million included in AOCI. Any net unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer will remain in AOCI and be amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the securities using the effective interest method. The amortization of amounts retained in AOCI will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from transferring the securities at fair value. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, $301.5 million of securities were transferred from AFS to HTM, all of which were transferred in the second quarter of 2020. For additional information relating to the securities portfolio, refer to Note 4 — Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Northern Trust participates in the repurchase agreement market as a relatively low-cost alternative for short-term funding. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until their repurchase. For additional information relating to the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, refer to Note 5 — Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Nonaccrual Loans and Leases and Other Real Estate Owned Nonaccrual assets consist of nonaccrual loans and leases and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. The following table provides the amounts of nonaccrual loans and leases, by loan and lease segment and class, and of OREO that were outstanding at the dates shown, as well as the balance of loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiation and renewals. 
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS There are no accounting pronouncements and developments issued but not yet effective as of June 30, 2021 that are expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or results of operations. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity and Market Value of Equity (MVE) sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of (1) (1) (1) 29 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet. As part of its risk management activities, Northern Trust also measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a Value-atRisk (VaR) model and applying the historical simulation methodology. The following information about Northern Trust’s management of market risk should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. NII Sensitivity — The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk). The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation: ▪ the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment; ▪ prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions; ▪ cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor; ▪ nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies or judgment; and ▪ new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices. The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 basis point ramp downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.
