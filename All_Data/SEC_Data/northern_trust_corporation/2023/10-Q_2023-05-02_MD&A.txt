Items 2. and 3. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) for the first quarter of 2023. The following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in this report as well as the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Investors also should read the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” Certain terms used in this report are defined in the Glossary included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The Corporation is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals. The Corporation focuses on managing and servicing client assets through its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms “Northern Trust,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its,” or similar terms mean the Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Overview of Financial Results Net Income per diluted common share was $1.51 in the current quarter and $1.77 in the first quarter of 2022. Net Income decreased $54.7 million to $334.6 million in the current quarter from $389.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Annualized return on average common equity was 12.4% in the current quarter and 14.2% in the prioryear quarter. The annualized return on average assets was 0.92% in the current quarter as compared to 0.97% in the prior-year quarter. Reflected in Net Income were impacts from the changes in monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve Board to address inflation, which positively impacted Net Interest Income while dampening equity market indices, adversely impacting fees earned based on market values. The impacts of a tight labor market are reflected in our Compensation expense. Inflationary pressures were also reflected in higher Equipment and Software expense. Revenue increased $25.9 million, or 2%, to $1.74 billion in the current quarter from $1.72 billion in the prior-year quarter. Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees decreased $104.8 million, or 9%, from $1.17 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.06 billion in the current quarter, primarily due to lagged unfavorable markets, asset outflows, and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower money market fund fee waivers. Other Noninterest Income decreased $19.5 million, or 11%, from $169.3 million in the prior-year quarter to $149.8 million in the current quarter, primarily reflecting lower Foreign Exchange Trading Income, partially offset by changes in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net and higher Other Operating Income. Net Interest Income increased $150.2 million, or 39%, to $531.2 million in the current quarter as compared to $381.0 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a higher net interest margin, partially offset by lower average earning assets. There was a $15.0 million Provision for Credit Losses in the current quarter, as compared to a $2.0 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter provision was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate portfolio, primarily in multi-family properties, partially offset by improvement in credit quality for the commercial and institutional segment. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. Noninterest Expense increased $79.7 million, or 7%, from $1.21 billion in the prior-year quarter to $1.29 billion in the current quarter, primarily attributable to higher Equipment and Software, Compensation, Occupancy, and Other Operating Expense. The Provision for Income Taxes in the current quarter totaled $109.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6%. The Provision for Income Taxes in the prioryear quarter totaled $121.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.8%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a higher net tax impact from international operations and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a higher level of tax benefits from taxcredit investments and tax-exempt income. 3 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are based primarily on the market value of assets held in custody, managed or serviced; the volume of transactions; securities lending volume and spreads; and fees for other services rendered. Certain market value calculations on which fees are based are performed on a monthly or quarterly basis in arrears. Northern Trust voluntarily waived $2.0 million of money market fund fees for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $50.7 million of money market fund fees for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The components of Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are provided below. Asset Servicing Custody and Fund Administration fees, the largest component of Asset Servicing fees, are driven primarily by values of client assets under custody/administration (AUC/A), transaction volumes and the number of accounts. The asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. Custody fees related to asset values are client-specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. The fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. Investment Management fees are based generally on market values of client assets under management throughout the period. Typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag. Securities Lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. The Other fee category in Asset Servicing includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. Revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee. Custody and Fund Administration fees decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. Investment Management fees decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets, partially offset by lower money market fund fee waivers. Wealth Management Wealth Management fee income is calculated primarily based on market values and is impacted by both one-month and one-quarter lagged asset values. Fee income in the regions (Central, East and West) decreased from the prior-year quarter, due to unfavorable markets and product-related asset outflows, partially offset by lower money market fund fee waivers. Foreign Exchange Trading Income decreased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange swap activity and lower client volumes. Other Operating Income increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by increased income related to a bank-owned life insurance program and other miscellaneous income, partially offset by higher expenses related to existing swap agreements related to Visa Inc. Class B common shares. Please refer to Note 15— Other Operating Income to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for further detail. Investment Security Gains (Losses), Net included a $6.9 million gain upon sale of certain available for sale debt securities in the current quarter. Please refer to Note 4 —Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for additional details related to the sale of available for sale debt securities. 7 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Net Interest Income Net Interest Income is defined as the total of Interest Income and amortized fees on earning assets, less Interest Expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. Earning assets—including Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, Interest-Bearing Due From and Deposits with Banks, Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits, Securities, Loans, and Other Interest-Earning Assets—are financed by a large base of interest-bearing funds that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt. Short-term borrowings include Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. Earning assets are also funded by noninterest-related funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders’ equity. Net Interest Income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact Net Interest Income. Net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Net Interest Income stated on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis is a non-generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. A reconciliation of Net Interest Income on a GAAP basis to Net Interest Income on an FTE basis is provided in “Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent” within this MD&A. Net Interest Income, stated on a FTE basis, increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a higher net interest margin, partially offset by lower average earning assets. Average earning assets decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to decreased funding from client deposits, partially offset by higher short-term borrowing activity. For interest-earning assets, this manifested in lower levels of securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by higher level of loans. The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Federal Reserve and Other Central Bank Deposits averaged $36.6 billion and decreased $8.6 billion, or 19%, from $45.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. InterestBearing Due from and Deposits with Banks averaged $4.2 billion and decreased $0.2 billion, or 4%, from $4.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average Securities were $50.4 billion and decreased $8.4 billion, or 14%, from $58.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average Other Interest-Earning Assets include certain community development investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, Federal Reserve stock, and money market investments of $901.3 million, $353.0 million, $166.7 million, $70.0 million, and $62.3 million respectively, which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Average taxable Securities were $47.4 billion in the current quarter and $56.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. Average nontaxable Securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from U.S. federal and state income taxes, were $3.0 billion in the current quarter and $2.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. (1) (1) 10 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Net Interest Income (continued) Loans and Leases averaged $42.0 billion and increased $2.5 billion, or 6%, from $39.5 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher levels of commercial and institutional, non-U.S., commercial real estate, and residential real estate loans, partially offset by lower levels of private client loans. Commercial and institutional loans averaged $12.4 billion and increased $740.8 million, or 6%, from $11.7 billion for the prior-year quarter. Non-U.S. loans averaged $3.6 billion and increased $676.6 million or 23%, from $2.9 billion for the prior-year quarter. Commercial real estate loans averaged $4.9 billion and increased $590.0 million, or 14%, from $4.3 billion for the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans averaged $6.4 billion and increased $228.6 million, or 4%, from $6.2 billion for the prior-year quarter. Private client loans averaged $13.9 billion and decreased $182.8 million, or 1%, from $14.1 billion for the prior-year quarter. Northern Trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits decreased $9.4 billion, or 9%, to an average of $92.0 billion in the current quarter from $101.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. Other Average Interest-Related Funds increased $12.6 billion, or 168%, to an average of $20.1 billion in the current quarter from $7.5 billion in the prior-year quarter. The balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. Interest expense for Interest-Bearing Deposits in the current quarter was driven by higher interest rates. Average Non-U.S. Offices Interest-Bearing Deposits comprised 68% and 67% of total average Interest-Bearing Deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Provision for Credit Losses There was a $15.0 million Provision for Credit Losses in the current quarter, as compared to a $2.0 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The provision in the current quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate portfolio, primarily in multi-family properties, partially offset by improvement in credit quality for the commercial and institutional segment. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on an individual basis for two commercial borrowers, partially offset by a slight decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis. The decrease in the collective basis reserve was primarily due to continued improvements in credit quality mainly within the commercial real estate portfolio, partially offset by increases in the reserve driven by projected economic conditions at the time. Net charge-offs in the current quarter were $2.9 million, reflecting $1.1 million of recoveries and $4.0 million of charge-offs. The prior-year quarter included $3.2 million of net recoveries, reflecting $3.3 million of recoveries and $0.1 million of charge-offs. Nonaccrual assets of $48.9 million decreased $52.1 million, or 52%, from $101.0 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. For additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Asset Quality” section in this MD&A. Compensation expense, the largest component of Noninterest Expense, increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher salary expense, partially offset by lower incentives and favorable currency translation. Equipment and Software expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher amortization as well as higher software costs driven by continued technology investments. 11 FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) Noninterest Expense (continued) Occupancy expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a $9.8 million charge in the current quarter related to early lease exits. Other Operating Expense increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher business promotion expense. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $109.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 24.6%, compared to $121.5 million in the prioryear quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 23.8%. The effective tax rate increased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a higher net tax impact from international operations and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a higher level of tax benefits from tax-credit investments and tax-exempt income. REPORTING SEGMENTS Northern Trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income. Revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment. Reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. Asset Servicing Asset Servicing Net Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Net Income increased $1.7 million, or 1%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Net Interest Income, a release of credit reserves compared to a Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter, and higher Other Noninterest Income, offset by lower Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, higher Noninterest Expense, lower Foreign Exchange Trading Income, and a higher Provision for Income Taxes. Asset Servicing Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Asset Servicing Trust, Investment, and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Asset Servicing Foreign Exchange Trading Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Foreign Exchange Trading Income decreased $22.5 million, or 29%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange swap activity and lower client volumes. Asset Servicing Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Other Noninterest Income increased $2.1 million, or 3%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher Other Operating Income, partially offset by lower Security Commissions and Trading Income. Asset Servicing Net Interest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased $122.0 million, or 64%, from the prior-year quarter. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily reflected a higher net interest margin. Average earning assets decreased $12.4 billion, or 11%, to $102.0 billion in the current quarter from $114.4 billion in the prior-year quarter. The earning assets and funding sources in Asset Servicing for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 consisted primarily of money market assets, intercompany assets, and loans, and non-U.S. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, respectively. 13 REPORTING SEGMENTS (continued) Asset Servicing (continued) Asset Servicing Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, there was a $2.9 million release of credit reserves, compared to an $8.4 million Provision for Credit Losses in the prior-year quarter. The release of credit reserves in the current quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis driven by improvement in credit quality for the commercial and institutional segment. The reserve evaluated on a collective basis relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar characteristics. Asset Servicing Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $43.1 million, or 6%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher expense allocations and Compensation expense. Wealth Management Wealth Management Net Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Net Income decreased $49.8 million, or 22%, from the prior-year quarter primarily due to lower Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, a Provision for Credit Losses compared to a release of credit reserves in the prior-year quarter, and higher Noninterest Expense, partially offset by higher Net Interest Income. Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees For an explanation of Wealth Management Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees, please see the “Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees” section within the Consolidated Results of Operations section of the MD&A. Wealth Management Other Noninterest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Other Noninterest Income increased $2.5 million, or 8%, from the prior-year quarter primarily due to higher Security Commissions and Trading Income and Other Operating Income. Wealth Management Net Interest Income For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Net Interest Income stated on an FTE basis increased $34.7 million, or 18%, from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher average loans and a higher net interest margin. Average earning assets decreased $1.4 billion, or 4%, to $34.0 billion in the current quarter from $35.4 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower allocations. The earning assets and funding sources in Wealth Management for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 were primarily comprised of loans and domestic interest-bearing deposits, respectively. Wealth Management Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, there was a $17.9 million Provision for Credit Losses, compared to a $6.4 million release of credit reserves from the prior-year quarter. The Provision for Credit Losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 reflected an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. The increase in the collective basis reserve was driven by growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate portfolio, primarily in multi-family properties. Wealth Management Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Noninterest Expense, which includes the direct expenses of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased $24.1 million or 5% from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Compensation expense and expense allocations. Other Other—Noninterest Expense For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Other Noninterest Expense increased $12.5 million, primarily due to higher non-allocated occupancy expense related to a $9.8 million charge in the current quarter arising from early lease exits. Select Earning Assets. Average securities decreased from the prior-year quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning early in the quarter and reinvesting in short-term securities that will mature usually in one year or less. For additional discussion relating to the securities portfolio, refer to the “Asset Quality” section in this MD&A and to Note 4—Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Client Deposits. Average Interest-Bearing Deposits and Demand and Other Noninterest-Bearing Deposits decreased from the prior-year quarter as clients migrated into higher yielding products. Short-Term Borrowings. Short-term borrowings includes Federal Funds Purchased, Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase, and Other Borrowings. The increase in average Other Borrowings from the prior-year quarter was primarily due to borrowings executed to help manage our liquidity ratios and as part of an overall net interest income strategy, based on the spread earned on these borrowings. Stockholders’ Equity. The decrease in average Stockholders’ Equity was primarily attributable to changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss relative to the prior-year quarter, partially offset by higher Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-In Capital. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $158.6 million to common stockholders and cash dividends totaling $16.2 million to preferred stockholders. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $147.8 million to common stockholders, and cash dividends totaling $16.2 million to preferred stockholders, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Corporation repurchased 1,050,227 shares of common stock, at a total cost of $100.9 million ($96.04 average price per share), including 326,811 shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Corporation repurchased 295,410 shares of common stock, all of which were shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation, at a total cost of $33.8 million ($114.58 average price per share). ASSET QUALITY Securities Portfolio Northern Trust maintains a high quality debt securities portfolio. Debt securities not explicitly rated were grouped where possible under the credit rating of the issuer of the security. The following tables provide the fair value of available for sale (AFS) debt securities and amortized cost of held to maturity (HTM) debt securities by credit rating. As of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 2% of HTM debt securities not rated by Moody’s, S&P Global or Fitch Ratings consisted of certificates of deposit with a remaining life of less than six months, as well as investments purchased by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Northern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-tomoderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. Net unrealized losses within the investment securities portfolio totaled $2.7 billion at March 31, 2023, compared to net unrealized losses of $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. Net unrealized losses as of March 31, 2023 were comprised of $16.7 17 ASSET QUALITY (continued) Securities Portfolio (continued) million and $2.7 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. $849.7 million of the $2.7 billion gross unrealized losses relate to AFS debt securities. Net unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022 were comprised of $9.1 million and $3.2 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, the $24.6 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $258.5 million, $237.7 million, and $106.4 million related to governmentsponsored agency securities, other asset-backed and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the $26.7 billion AFS debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $351.6 million, $288.1 million, and $157.6 million related to government sponsored agency, other asset-backed, and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. As of December 31, 2022, the Corporation intended to sell certain AFS debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position. The securities were written down to their fair value of $2.1 billion with a $213.0 million loss recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income. In January 2023, the securities were subsequently sold resulting in an incremental $6.9 million gain upon sale as compared to the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, the $24.7 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $949.8 million and $397.1 million related to government-sponsored agency securities and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the $25.0 billion HTM debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of $1.1 billion and $436.1 million related to government-sponsored agency and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase. HTM debt securities consist of securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. For additional information relating to the securities portfolio, refer to Note 4—Securities to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until their repurchase. For additional information relating to the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, refer to Note 22—Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Nonaccrual Loans and Other Real Estate Owned Nonaccrual assets consist of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (OREO). OREO is comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. The following table provides the amounts of nonaccrual loans, by loan segment and class, and of OREO that were outstanding at the dates shown, as well as the balance of loans that were delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Loans that are delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections, renegotiation and renewals. Nonaccrual assets of $48.9 million as of March 31, 2023 increased from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the addition of three nonaccrual loans, one each in the commercial and institutional, residential real estate, and private client portfolios, partially offset by a charge-off in the commercial real estate portfolio. In addition to the negative impact on Net Interest Income and the risk of credit losses, nonaccrual assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts. Changes in the level of nonaccrual assets may be indicative of changes in the credit quality of one or more loan classes. Changes in credit quality impact the allowance for credit losses through the resultant adjustment of the allowance evaluated on an individual basis and the quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance evaluated on a collective basis within the allowance for credit losses. Northern Trust’s credit policies do not allow for the origination of loan types generally considered to be high risk in nature, such as option adjustable rate mortgage loans, subprime loans, loans with initial “teaser” rates and loans with excessively high loan-to-value ratios. Residential real estate loans consist of first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value of no more than 65% to 80% at inception. Appraisals of supporting collateral for residential real estate loans are obtained at loan origination and upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Residential real estate collateral appraisals are performed and reviewed by independent third parties. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. Underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage requirements. Recourse to owners through guarantees also is commonly required. For additional information relating to the loans portfolio, refer to Note 5—Loans to the consolidated financial statements provided in Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, offbalance-sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation. Management’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Credit Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting segments. Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities of $164.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties and an increase in receivables, partially offset by period earnings, net changes in other operating activities, and the impact of lower non-cash charges such as amortization and depreciation. Net cash provided by operating activities of $746.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to net changes in other operating activities, period earnings, decrease in receivables and the impact of lower non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities of $4.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to net proceeds associated with AFS and HTM debt securities, and decreased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits. Net cash provided by investing activities of $10.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to decreased levels of Federal Reserve and other central bank deposits, net proceeds associated with HTM debt securities and lower levels of loans and leases, partially offset by higher levels of interestbearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of $4.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to the decreased levels of total deposits, partially offset by increased levels of short-term other borrowings and federal funds purchased. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of savings, money market and other interest-bearing deposits. Net cash used in financing activities of $10.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to decreased levels of total deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The decrease in total deposits was primarily attributable to lower levels of interest-bearing non-U.S. office client deposits, savings, money market and other interest-bearing deposits, and non-U.S. office noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increased domestic noninterestbearing deposits. 21 CAPITAL RATIOS The capital ratios of Northern Trust Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company, remained strong at March 31, 2023, exceeding the requirements for classification as “well-capitalized” under applicable U.S. regulatory requirements. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to stringent capital standards. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, capital adequacy reporting that deducts any unrealized losses related to AFS securities from reported capital, and stringent, annual company-run and supervisory stress testing in the form of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercises, which confirms our ability to remain solvent under severely adverse market conditions. The results of the 2022 Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 23, 2022, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the 2022 Capital Plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2022. The table below provides capital ratios, as well as the required minimum capital ratios, for Northern Trust Corporation and The Northern Trust Company determined by Basel III phased-in requirements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-02, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method—a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force” (ASU 2023-02). The amendments in ASU 2023-02 permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). In addition, ASU 2023-02 requires specific disclosures that must be applied to all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program for which the entity has elected to apply the proportional amortization method in accordance with Subtopic 323-740. ASU 2023-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, although early adoption is permitted. Northern Trust is currently assessing the impacts of electing the proportional amortization method for qualifying tax equity investments under ASU 2023-02, including early adoption. RISK MANAGEMENT Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to stringent liquidity standards. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily Liquidity Coverage Ratio calculations to regulators. We maintain a highly liquid balance sheet consisting principally of cash held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks, money market assets, and short-term investment securities, which were 63% of total assets as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 85% and 81% of Northern Trust’s securities portfolio is composed of U.S. Treasury, government sponsored agency and triple-A rated securities as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Market Risk There are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in Net Interest Income and the market value of equity, including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions. Northern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: Net Interest Income (NII) sensitivity and Market Value of Equity (MVE) sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet. Higher interest rates may impact the fair value of available for sale debt securities which in turn affects Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) that can impact regulatory capital ratios. As part of its risk management activities, Northern Trust also measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model and applying the historical simulation methodology. The following information about Northern Trust’s management of market risk should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. NII Sensitivity — The modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance-sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk). The NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation: ▪ the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment; ▪ prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions; 23 RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Market Risk (continued) ▪ cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor; ▪ nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and ▪ new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices. The following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 basis point ramp downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. A 200 basis point ramp downward movement in interest rate relative to forward rate is also provided as of March 31, 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. Given the low level of interest rates at the time and assumed interest rate floors as rates approach zero, the 200 basis point ramp downward movement in interest rate relative to forward rate as of March 31, 2022 would not provide meaningful results and is therefore not provided.
