Refer to Table 1 for selected financial data for the past three years.Non-GAAP financial measures Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, is presented with its different components on Table 3 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared with the same period in 2020, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and sponsored entities, and certain obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its agencies and assets held by the Corporation’s international banking entities. To facilitate 6 POPULAR, INC. 2021 ANNUAL REPORT the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense and other related expense disallowances required by the Puerto Rico tax law. Under Puerto Rico tax law, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and exempt sources. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021 The Corporation’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $934.9 million, compared to a net income of $506.6 million for 2020. The discussion that follows provides highlights of the Corporation’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the results of operations of 2020. It also provides some highlights with respect to the Corporation’s financial condition, credit quality, capital and liquidity. Table 2 presents a three-year summary of the components of net income as a percentage of average total assets. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2.0 billion, an increase of $101.0 million when compared to 2020. The increase in net interest income was mainly driven by higher interest income from commercial loans due to income from loans under the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), and higher income from investment securities. In addition, lower interest expense on deposits, despite the higher volume, contributed to the higher net interest income. The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 2.88% compared to 3.29% for the same period in 2020 and was impacted by prolonged low interest rates as well as the change in the earning assets composition. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin was 3.19% in 2021, compared to 3.62% in 2020. Refer to the Net Interest Income section of this MD&A for additional information. The Corporation’s total provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $193.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a provision expense of $292.5 million for 2020. The benefit for the year 2021 was due to improvements in credit quality and the macroeconomic outlook. The Corporation continued to exhibit strong credit quality trends and low credit costs with low levels of net charge-offs and lower non-performing loans.

Refer to the Provision for Credit Losses and Credit Risk sections of this MD&A for information on the allowance for credit losses, non-performing assets, troubled debt restructurings, net charge-offs and credit quality metrics. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $642.1 million, an increase of $129.8 million, when compared with 2020, mostly due to: higher service fees and service charges on deposit accounts due to economic disruptions related to the pandemic, the waiver of service charges and late fees during 2020, higher income from mortgage banking activities and higher other operating income principally due to higher net earnings from the combined portfolio of investments under the equity method. Refer to the Non-Interest Income section of this MD&A for additional information on the major variances of the different categories of non-interest income. Total operating expenses amounted to $1.5 billion for the year 2021, reflecting an increase of $91.4 million, when compared to the same period in 2020, mainly due to higher personnel costs.

Income tax expense amounted to $309.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with an income tax expense of $111.9 million for the previous year. The increase in income tax expense for the year is mainly due to a higher pre-tax income. Refer to the Income Taxes section in this MD&A and Note 35 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s total assets were $75.1 billion, compared with $65.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase of $9.2 billion is mainly driven by higher money market investments and debt securities available-for-sale due to the additional funds available to invest resulting from the increase in deposits across various sectors, partially offset by paydowns of agency mortgage-backed securities. Refer to the Statement of Condition Analysis section of this MD&A for additional information. Deposits amounted to $67.0 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $56.9 billion at December 31, 2020. Table 7 presents a breakdown of deposits by major categories. The increase in deposits was mainly due to higher Puerto Rico public sector deposits and higher balances in retail and commercial demand deposits accounts. The Corporation’s borrowings remained flat at $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the Corporation’s borrowings. Refer to Table 6 in the Statement of Financial Condition Analysis section of this MD&A for the percentage allocation of the composition of the Corporation’s financing to total assets. Stockholders’ equity remained flat at $6.0 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020. The net activity for the year was mainly due to net income of $934.9 million for the year 2021 offset by unrealized losses on debt securities available-for-sale and by capital return transactions, including an accelerated share repurchase transaction completed during 2021. The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries continue to be well-capitalized at December 31, 2021.
