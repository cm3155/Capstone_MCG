&#160; 

Capital Actions 

&#160; 

On May 6, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share on its outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2021. 

&#160; 

On May 3, 2021, the Corporation announced that it had entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the &#8220;ASR Agreement&#8221;) to repurchase an aggregate of $350 million of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock. Under the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 4, 2021 the Corporation made an initial payment of $350 million and received an initial delivery of 3,785,831 shares of the Corporation&#8217;s Common Stock (the &#8220;Initial Shares&#8221;). The transaction was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction. Furthermore, as a result of the receipt of the Initial Shares, the Corporation recognized in stockholders&#8217; equity approximately $280 million in treasury stock and $70 million as a reduction of capital surplus. Upon the final settlement of the ASR Agreement, the Corporation expects to further adjust its treasury stock and capital surplus accounts to reflect the final delivery or receipt of cash or shares, which will depend on the volume-weighted average price of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. The final settlement of the ASR Agreement is expected to occur no later than the third quarter of 2021.

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and sponsored entities, certain obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and/or its agencies and municipalities and assets held by the Corporation&#8217;s international banking entities. To facilitate the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense and other related expense disallowances required by Puerto Rico tax law. Thereunder, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is presented with its different components in Table 2, along with the reconciliation to net interest income (GAAP), for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 as compared with the same periods in 2020, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

Financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 

&#61623; For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded net income of $ 262.6 million , compared to net income of $ 34.3 mi llion for the same quarter of the previous year. Net interest income was $479.1 million, an increase of $6.0 million when compared to the same quarter of 2020. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 3.07%, a decrease of 87 basis points when compared to 3.94% for the same quarter of the previous year, driven by the decrease in the Federal Funds Rate and the increase in average deposits, which were redeployed mostly at overnight Fed Funds, U.S. Treasuries, agency debt securities and in loans funded under the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). On a taxable equivalent basis, the net interest margin was of 3.39%, compared to 4.34% for the same quarter of the previous year. The provision for credit losses for the loan portfolio was a benefit of $75.8 million, a decrease of $264.8 million when compared to the same quarter of 2020, reflecting changes to the economic outlook, qualitative reserves, and portfolio credit quality. Non-interest income was higher by $27.0 million mostly due to higher income from mortgage banking activities, mainly due to a favorable variance in fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights. Operating expenses were higher by $2.9 million principally due to higher personnel costs, partially offset by lower other real estate expenses. 

&#61623; Total assets at March 31, 2021 amounted to $66.9 billion, compared to $65.9 billion, at December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher debt securities available-for-sale due to purchases of U.S. treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. 

&#61623; Total deposits at March 31, 2021 increased by $1.9 billion when compared to deposits at December 31, 2020, mainly due to higher retail and commercial demand deposits at BPPR. 

&#61623; Capital ratios continued to be strong. As of March 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 17.08%, while the total capital ratio was 19.62%. Refer to Table 7 for capital ratios.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 

&#160; 

The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and general practices within the financial services industry. Various elements of the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Corporation&#8217;s Audit Committee. The Corporation has identified as critical accounting policies those related to: (i) Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality; (iv) Income Taxes; (v) Goodwill; and (vi) Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations. For a summary of these critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to that particular section in the MD&#38;A included in Popular, Inc.&#8217;s 2020 Form 10-K. Also, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2020 Form 10-K for a summary of the Corporation&#8217;s significant accounting policies and to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for information on recently adopted accounting standard updates.

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

&#160; 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

&#160; 

Net interest income for the first quarter of 2021 was $479.1 million, an increase of $6.0 million when compared to $473.1 million for the same quarter of 2020. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $529.8 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $8.3 million when compared to $521.5 million for the same quarter of 2020. 

&#160; 

Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 3.07%, a decrease of 87 basis points when compared to 3.94% for the same quarter of the previous year. The lower net interest margin for the quarter is mainly driven by the decrease of 150 basis points in the Federal Funds Rate that occurred in March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also impacting the net interest margin is the increase in average deposits of $14.0 billion resulting from pandemic relief programs, which were redeployed in overnight Fed Funds, investment securities and loans funded under the SBA PPP. Loans under the SBA PPP had an average balance of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2021. Management is constantly monitoring the liquidity position of the Corporation and has taken actions to deploy a portion of this liquidity. These actions include bulk loan repurchases from its GNMA, FNMA and FHMLC loan servicing portfolios, which occurred in the third quarter of 2020 , and acquiring investment securities, including U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. The net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the first quarter of 2021 was 3.39%, a decrease of 95 basis points when compared to 4.34% for the same quarter of 2020.The detailed variances of the decrease in net interest income are described below: 

&#160; 

Negative variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest income from money market investments related to the above-mentioned decrease in the Federal funds rate, partially offset by an increase in average volume; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from investment securities due lower yield, partially offset by a higher volume of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, related to purchases to deploy liquidity and to benefit from the Puerto Rico tax exemption of these assets; and 

&#61623; Lower interest income from loans driven by lower interest income from a lower volume of consumer loans, and by the impact of the decrease in rates in variable rate loans and loans issued under a lower interest rate environment. Partially offsetting these negative variances is a higher average loan balance, mainly mortgage, auto loan and lease financing and PPP loans. The latter carry a yield of approximately 7.21%, including the amortization of fees received under the program which is accelerated upon the full repayment of these loans . 

&#160; 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on deposits due to lower interest cost by 44 basis points resulting from the decrease in market rates, mostly on Puerto Rico Government and U.S. deposits, and management actions to reduce rates in most deposit categories, partially offset by higher average interest-bearing deposits increasing by $9.7 billion when compared with the same quarter in 2020, therefore increasing interest expense. 

&#160; 

Interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, included the amortization of deferred loans fees, prepayment penalties, late fees and the amortization of premium/discounts, amounting to $26.6 million, including $20.0 million on fees related to PPP loans, compared with $11.2 million income from the same quarter in 2020. Excluding the impact of PPP fees, the decrease is related to a lower amortization of PCD loans and lower amortization of the fair value discount of auto and credit card portfolios acquired in previous years.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded a release of $82.2 million for its reserve for credit losses related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. The Corporation&#8217;s provision for credit losses for its loans-held-in-portfolio for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 decreased by $264.8 million to a benefit of $75.8 million, compared to a provision expense of $189.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The decrease reflects changes to the economic outlook, qualitative reserves, and portfolio credit quality. The provision for unfunded commitments for the first quarter of 2021 reflected a benefit of $6.3 million, compared to a provision expense of $1.2 million for the same period of 2020. 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses for the BPPR segment was a benefit of $40.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared to a provision expense of $113.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of $153.0 million. The Popular U.S. segment provision for credit losses was also a benefit of $35.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, a decrease of $111.8 million, compared to a provision expense of $76.0 million for the same quarter in 2020. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2021, the total allowance for credit losses for loans held-in-portfolio amounted to $800.8 million, compared to $896.3 million as of December 31, 2020. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.75% at March 31, 2021, compared to 3.05% at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s methodology to estimate its allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;). Refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD&#38;A for a detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, the allowance for credit losses and selected loan losses statistics. 

&#160; 

Provision for Credit Losses &#8211; Investment Securities 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s provision for credit losses related to its investment securities held-to-maturity is related to the portfolio of obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico, states and political subdivisions. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the provision for credit losses was a benefit of $0.2 million, compared to a provision expense of $0.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2021, the total allowance for credit losses for this portfolio amounted to $10.1 million, compared to $10.3 million as of December 31, 2020. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-Interest Income 

&#160; 

Non-interest income was $153.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $27.0 million when compared with the same quarter of the previous year. The increase in non-interest income was primarily driven by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other service fees by $5.9 million mainly due to higher credit card fees by $5.5 million as a result of higher interchange transactional volumes; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher income from mortgage banking activities by $10.9 million mainly due to a favorable variance in fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) of $5.7 million due to a decrease in estimated prepayments driven by increases in interest rates, coupled with higher realized gains on closed derivative positions by $4.1 million; 

&#160; 

&#61623; a favorable variance in unrealized net gains on equity securities by $3.1 million mainly on deferred compensation plans that have an offsetting expense in personnel related expenses; 

&#160; 

&#61623; a favorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves on previously sold loans of $4.1 million mainly due to lower provision expense related to loans previously sold with credit recourse; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating income by $6.5 million mainly due to higher net earnings from the combined portfolio of investments under the equity method by $2.4 million and a higher gain on sale of daily auto rental units by $2.0 million. 

&#160; 

These increases were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts by $2.0 million due to increases in average deposits. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Operating Expenses 

&#160; 

Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 increased by $ 2.9 million when compared with the same quarter of 2020, driven primarily by: 

&#61623; higher personnel cost by $12.6 million mainly related to annual employee incentives tied to the Corporation&#8217;s financial performance by $7.4 million and higher commission, incentives and other bonuses by $8.0 million; partially offset by lower salaries by $2.9 million. 

Partially offset by: 

&#61623; lower professional fees by $1.1 million mainly due to lower advisory expenses; 

&#61623; lower business promotion by $1.7 million due to lower seasonal donations and advertising expense; 

&#61623; lower OREO expenses by $7.0 million mainly due to higher gain on sale of properties by $3.4 million and lower OREO costs including repairs and maintenance; and 

&#61623; lower other operating expenses by $1.4 million due mainly to lower pension plan expense driven by annual changes in actuarial assumptions by $2.5 million and lower provision for unfunded commitments by $1.2 million since this is currently presented within the provision for credit losses, while it was included within other expenses in the first quarter of 2020; partially offset by higher credit and debit card processing, volume and interchange expenses by $2.2 million.

INCOME TAXES 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $76.8 million with an effective tax rate (&#8220;ETR&#8221;) of 23%, compared to $3.1 million with an ETR of 8% for the same period of 2020.

&#160; 

&#160; 

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments for managerial reporting purposes consist of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. A Corporate grou p has been defined to support the reportable segments. 

&#160; 

For a description of the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments, including additional financial information and the underlying management accounting process, refer to Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

The Corporate group reported a net income of $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with a net loss of $0.9 million for the same quarter of the previous year . 

&#160; 

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable segments are discussed below: 

&#160; 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 

&#160; 

The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment&#8217;s net income amounted to $212.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared with net income of $78.1 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The increase in net income was principally driven by the benefit of $45.4 million in the reserve for credit losses and unfunded commitments recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results include the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher net interest income by $0.7 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest income from loans by $11.3 million mainly due to lower yields in the commercial portfolio and lower average balance and yields in consumer loans; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest income from investment securities by $8.3 million largely due to lower yields in money market investments and U.S. Treasuries due to the decrease interest rates, partially offset by higher income from mortgage-backed securities due to higher average balances; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest expense on deposits by $19.9 million mainly due to a lower cost of public sector deposits and time deposits, partially offset by higher average balances. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was 3.10% compared to 4.22% for the same quarter in the previous year. The decrease in net interest margin is driven by a lower yield in earning assets, and earning asset mix, partially offset by a lower cost of public sector deposits. 

&#160; 

&#61623; The BPPR segment recorded a benefit of $45.4 million in its reserve for credit losses and unfunded commitments for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 due to the improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and portfolio credit metrics. This compared to a provision expense of $113.6 million for the first quarter of 2020. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Non-interest income was higher by $23.1 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other service fees by $6.2 million mainly due to higher credit card fees as a result of higher interchange transactional volumes; 

&#61623; higher income from mortgage banking activities by $10.4 million due to a favorable variance in fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights of $5.8 million due to a decrease in estimated prepayments driven by increases in interest rates, coupled with higher realized gains on closed derivative positions; 

&#61623; a favorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves on previously sold loans of $4.1 million mainly due to lower provision expense related to loans previously sold with credit recourse; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating income by $4.0 million mainly due to higher gain on sale of daily auto rental units by $2.0 million, recoveries from the sale of acquired fully charged off loans by $1.0 million and higher net earnings from the combined portfolio of investments under the equity method; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower service charges on deposit accounts by $1.5 million due to an increase in average deposits. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher operating expenses by $5.0 million mostly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher personnel costs by $4.4 million due mainly to the annual incentives tied to the Corporation&#8217;s financial performance; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher occupancy expenses by $2.2 million, due to higher rent and lower income from building tenants; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other operating expenses by $9.8 million due to higher allocations from the Corporate segment, mainly related to professional services fees and personnel costs; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower professional fees by $3.0 million mainly due to lower advisory expenses related to corporate initiatives; and 

&#61623; Lower OREO expenses by $6.6 million mainly due to lower maintenance expenses and higher gain on sale of residential properties. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher income tax expense by $43.7 million due to higher income before tax. 

&#160; 

Popular U.S. 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported a net income of $47.8 million, compared with a net loss of $43.4 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The favorable variance was principally driven by the benefit of $36.7 million in the reserve for credit losses and unfunded commitments recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher net interest income by $6.5 million due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest expense on deposits by $13.1 million mainly due to lower interest rates; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest income from loans by $4.5 million mainly due to lower average balance in consumer loans; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest income from investment securities by $2.8 million due to lower yields and lower average balances. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was 3.35% compared to 3.21% for the same quarter in the previous year. 

&#160; 

&#61623; The PB segment recorded a benefit of $36.7 million in its reserve for credit losses and unfunded commitments for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 due to the improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and portfolio credit metrics. This compared to a provision expense of $76.0 million for the first quarter of 2020. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower operating expenses by $1.6 million due to: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower occupancy expense by 1.4 million due to lower rent expense related to the benefits of the completed branch optimization initiative in our New York Metro region; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower professional fees by $4.6 million, a portion of which is now centralized at the Corporate segment and charged back to operating units. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other operating expenses by $2.6 million due to higher Corporate expense allocations. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Income tax unfavorable variance of $30.0 million mainly due to income before tax of $65.9 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to a pre-tax loss of $55.4 million recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

Money market investments remained flat at $11.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

&#160; 

Debt securities available-for-sale increased by $1.2 billion to $22.8 billion at March 31, 2021. The increase was mainly due to purchases of U.S. treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by paydowns and a decrease in unrealized gains of $0.4 billion in this portfolio. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information with respect to the Corporation&#8217;s debt securities available-for-sale. 

Loans 

Refer to Table 4 for a breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio. Also, refer to Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information about the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio composition and loan purchases and sales. 

&#160; 

Loans held-in-portfolio decreased by $0.3 billion to $29.1 billion at March 31, 2021, mainly in commercial loans at BPPR, in part due to the repayments of PPP loans.

Deposits 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $58.8 billion at March 31, 2021, compared to $56.9 billion at December 31, 2020. The deposits increase of $1.9 billion was mainly due to higher retail and commercial demand deposits by $1.6 billion at BPPR and PB and higher savings account deposits at BPPR by $0.3 billion. Public sector deposit balances, which amounted to $15.0 billion at March 31, 2021, are expected to decline over the long term. However, the receipt by the P.R. Government of additional COVID-19-related Federal assistance and seasonal tax collections are likely to increase public deposit balances at BPPR in the near term. The rate at which public deposit balances will decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the timeline of current debt restructuring efforts under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) and the speed at which the COVID-19 federal assistance is distributed. Refer to Table 6 for a breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s deposits at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

&#160; 

REGULATORY CAPITAL 

&#160; 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB are subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. The risk-based capital standards applicable to the Corporation, BPPR and PB (&#8220;Basel III capital rules&#8221;) are based on the final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of March 31, 2021, t he Corporation&#8217;s, BPPR&#8217;s and PB&#8217;s capital ratios continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules. 

&#160;

[1] The CECL transitional amount includes the impact of Popular's adoption of the new CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020. 

&#160; 

The Basel III capital rules provide that a depository institution will be deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based ratio of at least 10%. Management has determined that as of March 31, 2021, the Corporation, BPPR and PB continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation elected to use the five-year transition period option as provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective March 31, 2020. The five-year transition period provision delays for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. 

&#160; 

On April 9, 2020, federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule to modify the Basel III regulatory capital rules applicable to banking organizations to allow those organizations participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the program. Specifically, the agencies have clarified that banking organizations, including the Corporation and its Bank subsidiaries, are permitted to assign a zero percent risk weight to PPP loans for purposes of determining risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, in order to facilitate use of the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the &#8220;PPPL Facility&#8221;), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation&#8217;s Bank subsidiaries to fund PPP loans, the agencies further clarified that, for purposes of determining leverage ratios, a banking organization is permitted to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a PPPL Facility. As of March 31, 2021, the Corporation has $1.2 billion in PPP loans and $934 thousand pledged as collateral for PPPL Facilities. 

&#160; 

The increase in the common equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio, total capital ratio, and leverage capital ratio as of March 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was mainly attributed to the three months period earnings. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-GAAP financial measures 

The tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share, which are presented in the table that follows, are non-GAAP measures. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method for mergers and acquisitions. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. 

&#160; 

Table 8 provides a reconciliation of total stockholders&#8217; equity to tangible common equity and total assets to tangible assets as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position. Other types of off-balance sheet arrangements that the Corporation enters in the ordinary course of business include derivatives and provision of guarantees, indemnifications, and representation and warranties. Refer to Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion related to the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under credit recourse and representation and warranties arrangements. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

The Corporation has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commercial commitments, which require future cash payments on debt agreements. 

As previously indicated, the Corporation also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive or pay cash, depending on changes in interest rates. These contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the statement of condition date. The fair value of the contract changes daily as interest rates change. The Corporation may also be required to post additional collateral on margin calls on the derivatives and repurchase transactions. 

Refer to Note 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of long-term borrowings by maturity. 

The Corporation utilizes lending-related financial instruments in the normal course of business to accommodate the financial needs of its customers. The Corporation&#8217;s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses credit procedures and policies in making those commitments and conditional obligations as it does in extending loans to customers. Since many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring, the total contractual amounts are not representative of the Corporation&#8217;s actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements for these commitments. 

Table 9 presents the contractual amounts related to the Corporation&#8217;s off-balance sheet lending and other activities at March 31, 2021.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the Corporation&#8217;s capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets and/or liabilities. 

Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for further information on the debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale amounted to $22.8 billion as of March 31, 2021. Other assets subject to market risk include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $84 million, mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $123 million and securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted to $37 million, as of March 31, 2021. 

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and option risks. In managing interest rate risk, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. 

Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII simulation modeling is prepared for a five-year period, which in conjunction with the EVE analysis, provides management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the Corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs. 

Management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various NII simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. For example, the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates, implied forwards, and parallel and non-parallel rate shocks. Management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures. 

The asset and liability management group perform validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis. In addition, the model and processes used to assess IRR are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the Model Governance and Validation policy. 

&#160; 

The Corporation processes NII simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same amount (parallel shifts). The rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of -100, -200, +100, +200 and +400 basis points during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses are based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes, interest rate spreads, loan prepayments and deposit elasticity. Thus, they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates. By their nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future. The following table presents the results of the simulations at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2021, NII simulations show the Corporation maintains an asset sensitive position and is expected to benefit from an overall rising rate environment. The increases in sensitivity for the period are primarily driven by deposit increases which have increased the level of cash reserves maintained at the Federal Reserve as well as liftoff effects from market rates increasing over the quarter. Popular assumes rates do not turn negative therefore the increase in rates in the quarter impacted declining rate scenarios as rates now have more room to fall and thus increase the projected NII impact (negative) in the declining rate scenarios. The sensitivity to rising rate scenarios increased as well driven by growth in deposits which rose the levels of short-term assets and cash reserves that the Company maintains at the Federal Reserve. These short-term assets reprice immediately in rising rate scenarios thus increasing the NII benefit in these scenarios. 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a third-party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity. Prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten (or lower prepayments could extend) the weighted average life of these portfolios. 

&#160; 

Trading 

The Corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries, BPPR and Popular Securities. Popular Securities&#8217; trading activities consist primarily of market-making activities to meet expected customers&#8217; needs related to its retail brokerage business, and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected short-term price movements. BPPR&#8217;s trading activities consist primarily of holding U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221; and hedging the related market risk with &#8220;TBA&#8221; (to-be-announced) market transactions. The objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from short-term market movements. In addition, BPPR uses forward contracts or TBAs to hedge its securitization pipeline. Risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with TBAs that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline. 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation held trading securities with a fair value of $37 million, representing approximately 0.1% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets. As shown in Table 11, the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgage-backed securities which at March 31, 2021 were investment grade securities. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the 

&#160; 

trading portfolio also included $0.1 million in Puerto Rico government obligations. Trading instruments are recognized at fair value, with changes resulting from fluctuations in market prices, interest rates or exchange rates reported in current period earnings. The Corporation recognized a net trading account loss of $45 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and a net trading account gain of $491 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are limited by internal policies. For each of the two subsidiaries, the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5-day net value-at-risk (&#8220;VAR&#8221;), with a confidence level of 99%. The VAR measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. 

The Corporation&#8217;s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately $0.4 million for the last week in March 2021. There are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with VAR modeling, and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates. Backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses, in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy. 

In the opinion of management, the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the Corporation. 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations, finance expected future growth, fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the Corporation&#8217;s tolerance for liquidity risk, including approving relevant risk limits and policies. The Board of Directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the Board&#8217;s Risk Management Committee and the Asset/Liability Management Committee. The management of liquidity risk, on a long-term and day-to-day basis, is the responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Division. The Corporation&#8217;s Corporate Treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors and for monitoring the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis. Also, the Corporate Treasury Division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process. The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies. 

An institution&#8217;s liquidity may be pressured if, for example, it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, its credit rating is downgraded, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution. Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. 

Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. It is also managed at the level of the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. As further explained below, a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies (the &#8220;BHCs&#8221;) are dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The Corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries. Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur. However, such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event, and are dependent on many assumptions. 

Deposits, including customer deposits, brokered deposits and public funds deposits, continue to be the most significant source of funds for the Corporation, funding 88% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets at March 31, 2021 and 86% at December 31, 2020. The ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 50% at March 31, 2021, compared to 52% at December 31, 2020. In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.3 billion in outstanding balances at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. A detailed description of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings, including their terms, is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the Corporation&#8217;s cash inflows and outflows. 

The following sections provide further information on the Corporation&#8217;s major funding activities and needs, as well as the risks involved in these activities. 

Banking Subsidiaries 

Primary sources of funding for the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries (BPPR and PB or, collectively, &#8220;the banking subsidiaries&#8221;) include retail, commercial and public sector deposits, brokered deposits, unpledged investment securities, mortgage loan securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 

Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries. 

The principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations, investment portfolio purchases, loan purchases and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses. Also, the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments, recourse provisions, servicing advances, derivatives, credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by BPPR. 

The banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows. The Corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various factors, including pricing, service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results, credit ratings (by nationally recognized credit rating agencies), and importantly, FDIC deposit insurance. Although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits, management does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings. 

Deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates. Refer to Table 6 for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit under $100,000, excluding brokered deposits with denominations under $100,000. Core deposits have historically provided the Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled $ 53.6 billion, or 91% of total deposits, at March 31, 2021 , compared with $51.7 billion, or 91% of total deposits, at December 31, 2020 . Core deposits financed 84% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at March 31, 2021, compared with 82% at December 31, 2020 . 

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of $100,000 and over at March 31, 2021 is presented in the table that follows:

The Corporation had $ 0.8 billion in brokered deposits at March 31, 2021 , which financed approximately 1% of its total assets (December 31, 2020 - $0.8 billion and 1%, respectively) . In the event that any of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a well-capitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators, that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits, which may hinder the Corporation&#8217;s ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts. 

Deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the Corporation. As of March 31, 2021, total public sector deposits were $15.0 billion, compared to $15.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Generally, these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return. This, now unpledged, collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash. However, there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral. 

At March 31, 2021 , management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity. Finally, if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Companies 

The principal sources of funding for the BHCs, which are Popular, Inc. (holding company only) and PNA, include cash on hand, investment securities, dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales, credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the BHCs. 

The principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt, and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest (related to trust preferred securities), the payment of dividends to common stockholders and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries. 

The BHCs have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their non-banking subsidiaries; however, the cash needs of the Corporation&#8217;s non-banking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal. These sources of funding have become more costly due to the Corporation&#8217;s principal credit rating being below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which affects the Corporation&#8217;s ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

The outstanding balance of notes payable at the BHCs amounted to $682 million at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 . 

The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable at March 31, 2021 are presented in Table 13.

Annual debt service at the BHCs is approximately $44 million, and the Corporation&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.40 per share. The BHCs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all BHCs obligations during the foreseeable future. As of March 31, 2021, the BHCs had cash and money markets investments totaling $150 million, borrowing potential of $152 million from its secured facility with BPPR. In addition to these liquidity sources, the stake in EVERTEC had a market value of $434 million as of March 31, 2021 and it represents an additional source of contingent liquidity. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The principal sources of funding for the non-banking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations, loan sales, repurchase agreements, capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies. The principal uses of funds for the non-banking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, operational expenses and payment of dividends to the BHCs. The liquidity needs of the non-banking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies. 

Dividends 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Corporation declared quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock of $0.40 per share, for a year-to-date total of $ 33.8 million. The dividends for the Corporation&#8217;s Series A preferred stock amounted to $0.4 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the BHC&#8217;s received dividends amounting to $2 million in dividends from its non-banking subsidiaries. Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc.&#8217;s primary source of liquidity. On May 6, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share on its outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2021. On May 3, 2021, the Corporation announced that it had entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the &#8220;ASR Agreement&#8221;) to repurchase an aggregate of $350 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated financial statements for additional information of the ASR. 

&#160; 

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

The debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity, which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements. The Corporation&#8217;s debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets. The availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s unpledged debt securities amounted to $5.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2020. A substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the U.S. money markets or from secured lending sources. 

Additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities, prepayments and sales. The loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets. In particular, mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have secondary markets which the Corporation could use. 

&#160; 

Financial information of guarantor and issuers of registered guaranteed securities 

The Corporation (not including any of its subsidiaries, &#8220;PIHC&#8221;) is the parent holding company of Popular North America &#8220;PNA&#8221; and has other subsidiaries through which it conducts its financial services operations. PNA is an operating, 100% subsidiary of Popular, Inc. Holding Company (&#8220;PIHC&#8221;) and is the holding company of its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Equity One, Inc. and Popular Bank, including Popular Bank&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries Popular Equipment Finance, Inc., Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A., and E-LOAN, Inc. 

PNA has issued junior subordinated debentures guaranteed by PIHC (together with PNA, the &#8220;obligor group&#8221;) purchased by statutory trusts established by the Corporation. These debentures were purchased by the statutory trust using the proceeds from trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as &#8220;capital securities&#8221;), together with the proceeds of the related issuances of common securities of the trusts. 

PIHC fully and unconditionally guarantees the junior subordinated debentures issued by PNA. PIHC&#8217;s obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts to the holders of the applicable capital securities or by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions by the applicable trust except to the extent such trust has funds available for such payments. If PIHC does not make interest payments on the debentures held by such trust, such trust will not pay distributions on the applicable capital securities and will not have funds available for such payments. PIHC&#8217;s guarantee of PNA&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures is unsecured and ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the PIHC&#8217;s other liabilities in the same manner as the applicable debentures as set forth in the applicable indentures&#894; and equally with all other guarantees that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection, which means that the guaranteed party may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the respective guarantee without suing any other person or entity. 

The principal sources of funding for PIHC and PNA have included dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. As further described below, in the Risk to Liquidity section, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. 

The following summarized financial information presents the financial position of the obligor group, on a combined basis at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and the results of their operations for the period ended March 31, 2021. Investments in and equity in the earnings from the other subsidiaries and affiliates that are not members of the obligor group have been excluded. 

The summarized financial information of the obligor group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. The obligor group's amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates have been presented in separate line items, if they are material. In addition, related parties transactions are presented separately.

&#160; 

Risks to Liquidity 

Total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis. Some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements, among other factors. Derivatives, such as those embedded in long-term repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps, and off-balance sheet exposures, such as recourse, performance bonds or credit card arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements. As their fair value increases, the collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities. 

&#160; 

The importance of the Puerto Rico market for the Corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities. In the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico, the credit quality of the Corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs. Refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of this MD&#38;A for some highlights on the current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. In order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario, management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable. These plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms, such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the FHLB and the FRB. 

The credit ratings of Popular&#8217;s debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the Corporation&#8217;s ability to borrow in the capital markets, its cost and access to funding sources. Credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management, geographic concentration in Puerto Rico, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources, among other factors. 

Furthermore, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. The ability of a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to its BHC could thus be impacted by its financial performance, thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the BHCs from the banking subsidiaries. This could, in turn, affect the BHCs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock, for example. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had $9 million in deposits at March 31, 2021 that are subject to rating triggers. 

In addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, as discussed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution&#8217;s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $43 million at March 31, 2021. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results.

Geographic and Government Risk 

&#160; 

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. The Corporation&#8217;s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Commonwealth&#8221; or &#8220;Puerto Rico&#8221;), which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

On December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally to other countries and jurisdictions, including the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels worldwide, including in the markets in which we do business. 

In Puerto Rico, former Governor Wanda V&#225;zquez issued an executive order in March 2020 declaring a health emergency, ordering residents to shelter in place, implementing a mandatory curfew, and requiring the closure of non-essential businesses. While many of the restrictions have been gradually lifted, a mandatory curfew is still in effect and most businesses have had to make significant adjustments to protect customers and employees, including transitioning to telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in compliance with health and safety guidelines. The Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly enacted legislation in April 2020 requiring financial institutions to offer moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was effective through August 2020. The Federal Government has also approved several economic stimulus measures that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic, including providing direct subsidies, expanding eligibility for and increasing unemployment benefits and guaranteeing through the Small Business Administration&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans to small and medium businesses. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the disease have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on economic activity worldwide, including in Puerto Rico. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue adversely affect economic activity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the same, the pace of global vaccination efforts, and the amount of federal and local assistance offered to offset the impact of the pandemic. Pursuant to the 2021 Fiscal Plan (as defined below), economic stimulus measures have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity in Puerto Rico and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to offset the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact in the medium- and long-term. 

For a discussion of the impact of the pandemic on the Corporation&#8217;s operations and financial results during the first quarter of 2021, refer to the MD&#38;A Significant Events section, on the accompanying financial statements. For additional discussion of risk factors related to the impact of the pandemic, see &#8220;Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; in the Corporation&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Economic Performance 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) contracted (in real terms) every fiscal year between 2007 and 2018, with the exception of fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the &#8220;Planning Board&#8221;) estimates, dated March 2021, the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP increased by 1.8% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Mar&#237;a. However, the Planning Board estimates that the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP decreased by approximately 3.2% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response 

&#160; 

to the same. Finally, the Planning Board projects that the negative effects of COVID-19 will continue through the current fiscal year, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2%. 

Fiscal Crisis 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s central government and many of its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities continue to face significant fiscal challenges, which have been primarily the result of economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy obligations, and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. As a result, the Commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities have been unable to make debt service payments on their outstanding bonds and notes since 2016. The escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in June 2016. As further discussed below under &#8220;Pending Title III Proceedings,&#8221; the Commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities are currently in the process of restructuring their debts through the debt restructuring mechanisms provided by PROMESA. 

PROMESA 

PROMESA, among other things, created a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;) with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the Commonwealth, its public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities and established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of such entities. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets, in accordance with modified accrual accounting, are produced for at least four consecutive years. In August 2016, President Obama appointed the seven voting members of the Oversight Board through the process established in PROMESA, which authorizes the President to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders and which process was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The terms of the original Oversight Board members expired in August 2019, but PROMESA allows members to remain in their roles until their successors have been appointed. All of the original members continued to serve on the Oversight Board on holdover status until 2020, when President Donald Trump reappointed three of the original members and appointed four new members to the Oversight Board. 

In October 2016, the Oversight Board designated the Commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities as &#8220;covered entities&#8221; under PROMESA. The only Commonwealth government entities that were not subject to such initial designation were the Commonwealth&#8217;s municipalities. In May 2019, however, the Oversight Board designated all of the Commonwealth&#8217;s municipalities as covered entities. At the Oversight Board&#8217;s request, covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the Oversight Board for its review and approval. They are also required to seek Oversight Board approval to issue, guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of $10 million or more. Finally, covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. 

Fiscal Plans 

Commonwealth Fiscal Plan . The Oversight Board has certified several fiscal plans for the Commonwealth since 2017. The most recent fiscal plan for the Commonwealth certified by the Oversight Board is dated April 23, 2021 (the &#8220;2021 Fiscal Plan&#8221;). 

Pursuant to the 2021 Fiscal Plan, while the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the same severely reduced economic activity and caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment in Puerto Rico, pandemic-related federal and local stimulus funding have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis. The 2021 Fiscal Plan&#8217;s economic projections incorporate adjustments for these short-term income effects for purposes of estimating tax receipts. For example, the 2021 Fiscal Plan estimates that real GNP contracted by 3% in fiscal year 2020, but estimates the GNP contraction adjusted for short-term income effects to have been approximately 1.1%. For fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the 2021 Fiscal Plan projects that real GNP will grow 1% and 0.6%, respectively, but projects that growth adjusted for income effects for such years will be approximately 3.8% and 1.5%, respectively. 

The 2021 Fiscal Plan projects that, if the fiscal measures and structural reforms contemplated by the plan are not successfully implemented, the Commonwealth will have a pre-contractual debt service deficit starting in fiscal year 2023. It estimates that the fiscal measures could drive approximately $10 billion in savings and extra revenue over fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and that the structural reforms could drive a cumulative 0.90% increase in growth by fiscal year 2051 (equal to approximately $30.7 billion). 

&#160; 

However, even after the fiscal measures and structural reforms, and before contractual debt service, the 2021 Fiscal Plan projects that there will be an annual deficit starting in fiscal year 2036. 

The 2021 Fiscal Plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of Commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of some municipalities. Since fiscal year 2017, Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have decreased by approximately 64% (from approximately $370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $132 million in fiscal year 2020). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, reductions in appropriations to municipalities were paused in fiscal year 2021. Municipalities have also received extraordinary appropriations and other funds from federally-funded programs during the current fiscal year, which has helped temporarily offset the impact of the reduced Commonwealth support. However, the 2021 Fiscal Plan contemplates additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities starting in fiscal year 2022, before eventually phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year 2025. Further, while the Commonwealth had enacted legislation in 2019 suspending the municipality&#8217;s obligations to contribute to the Commonwealth&#8217;s health plan and pay-as-you go retirement system, such legislation was challenged by the Oversight Board and eventually declared null by the Title III court in April 2020. As a result, municipalities are required to cover their own employees&#8217; healthcare costs and retirement benefits and had to reimburse the Commonwealth for such costs corresponding to the period during which the law in effect. Finally, t he 2021 Fiscal Plan notes that municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on Commonwealth appropriations and that this lack of fiscal management threatens the ability of municipalities to provide necessary services, such as health, sanitation, public safety, and emergency services to their residents, forcing them to prioritize expenditures. 

&#160; Other Fiscal Plans. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities. The certified fiscal plan for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (&#8220;PREPA&#8221;), Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric power utility, contemplated the transformation of Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric system through, among other things, the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to PREPA&#8217;s transmission and distribution system, and calls for significant structural reforms at PREPA. The procurement process for the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to PREPA&#8217;s transmission and distribution system (the &#8220;T&#38;D System&#8221;) was completed in June 2020. The selected proponent, LUMA Energy LLC (&#8220;LUMA&#8221;), and PREPA entered into a 15-year agreement whereby LUMA will be responsible for operating, maintaining and modernizing the T&#38;D System. LUMA and PREPA have announced that the transition of the operations of the T&#38;D System to LUMA is expected to occur on or about June 1, 2021. 

On April 23, 2021, the Oversight Board certified the latest version of the fiscal plan (the &#8220;CRIM Fiscal Plan&#8221;) for the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (&#8220;CRIM&#8221;), the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities. The CRIM Fiscal Plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of Puerto Rico&#8217;s property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections, including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties, and implementing operational and technological initiatives. 

Pending Title III Proceedings 

On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board, on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court to restructure the Commonwealth&#8217;s liabilities under Title III of PROMESA. The Oversight Board has subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (&#8220;COFINA&#8221;), the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (&#8220;ERS&#8221;), the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, PREPA and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (&#8220;PBA&#8221;). On February 12, 2019, the government completed a restructuring of COFINA&#8217;s debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the U.S. District Court. In March 2021, the Oversight Board filed a plan of adjustment for the Commonwealth, ERS and PBA in the pending debt restructuring proceedings under Title III of PROMESA. The plan, which has substantial support from several creditor constituencies but is still subject to confirmation in the Title III proceeding, seeks to restructure approximately $35 billion of debt and other claims against the Commonwealth, PBA and ERS, and more than $50 billion of pension liabilities. 

Seismic Activity 

On January 7, 2020, Puerto Rico was struck by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake, which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. The 6.4 earthquake was preceded by foreshocks and followed by aftershocks. The Commonwealth&#8217;s government has estimated total earthquake-related damages at approximately $1 billion. 

&#160; 

Exposure of the Corporation 

&#160; 

The credit quality of BPPR&#8217;s loan portfolio reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession have been reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. While PROMESA provided a process to address the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal crisis, the complexity and uncertainty of the Title III proceedings for the Commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans still present significant economic risks. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected many of our individual customers and customers&#8217; businesses. This, when added to Puerto Rico&#8217;s ongoing fiscal crisis and recession, could cause credit losses that adversely affect us and may negatively affect consumer confidence, result in reductions in consumer spending, and adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues. If global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board are unable to adequately manage the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges, including by controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and consummating an orderly restructuring of the Commonwealth&#8217;s debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government&#8217;s instrumentalities and municipalities totaled $375 million and $377 million, respectively, which amounts were fully outstanding on such dates. Further deterioration of the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us. Of the amount outstanding, $342 million consists of loans and $33 million are securities ($342 million and $35 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020). Substantially all of the amount outstanding at March 31, 2021 were obligations from various Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases, these were &#8220;general obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or &#8220;special obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At March 31, 2021, 74% of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam&#243;n. For additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to Note 20 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies. 

&#160; 

In addition, at March 31, 2021, the Corporation had $311 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities, but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental ($317 million at December 31, 2020). These included $255 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December 31, 2020 - $260 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Corporation also had, at March 31, 2021, $45 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions (December 31, 2020 - $46 million). In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of this loans, HFA&#8217;s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. The Corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, a moratorium on such obligations has not been imposed as of the date hereof. In addition, at March 31, 2021, the Corporation had $ 11 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by non-governmental parties (December 31, 2020 - $11 million). 

&#160; 

BPPR&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal crisis and the ongoing Title III proceedings under PROMESA described above. Similarly, BPPR&#8217;s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees, which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits. 

&#160; 

BPPR also has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the Oversight Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

United States Virgin Islands 

&#160; 

The Corporation has operations in the United States Virgin Islands (the &#8220;USVI&#8221;) and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. 

&#160; 

The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges, which have been and maybe be further exacerbated as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. 

&#160; 

To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $103 million, of which $69 million is outstanding (compared to $105 million and $70 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020). Of the amount outstanding, approximately (i) $42 million represents loans to the West Indian Company LTD, a government-owned company that owns and operates a cruise ship pier and shopping mall complex in St. Thomas, (ii) $20 million represents loans to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority, a public corporation of the USVI that operates USVI&#8217;s water production and electric generation plants, (iii) $3 million represents loans to the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority (&#8220;VI PFA&#8221; ), a public corporation of the USVI created for the purpose of raising capital for public projects and (iv) $4 million in loans to the Virgin Islands Porth Authority (compared to $43 million, $20 million, $3 million, and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020). 

&#160; 

British Virgin Islands 

&#160; 

The Corporation has operations in the British Virgin Islands (&#8220;BVI&#8221;), which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy. Although the Corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the BVI, it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately $250 million comprised of various retail and commercial clients, including a loan of approximately $18 million with the government of the BVI (compared to $251 million and $19 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020). 

&#160; 

U.S. Government 

&#160; 

As further detailed in Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities represented exposure to the U.S. Government in the form of U.S. Government sponsored entities, as well as agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.8 billion of residential mortgages, $1.2 billion of SBA loans under the PPP and $60 million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies at March 31, 2021 (compared to $1.8 billion, $1.3 billion and $60 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020). 

&#160; 

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets include primarily past-due loans that are no longer accruing interest, renegotiated loans, and real estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented in Table 16. 

The Corporation adopted the CECL accounting standard effective January 1, 2020. This framework requires management to estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the loan using economic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable period, and historical information thereafter. 

The Corporation exhibited improved credit quality metrics and lower credit costs during the first quarter of 2021, driven by the improving economic environment, which reflects the impact of the unprecedented amounts of government stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and prudent risk management practices. Notwithstanding, given the disruptions and continued uncertainties caused by the pandemic, we will continue to closely monitor economic conditions, the effect of the pandemic on our loan portfolios and associated risks. However, management believes that the improvement over the last few years in the risk profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios, along with the government stimulus, positions Popular to operate successfully under the current environment. 

Total NPAs decreased by $50 million when compared with December 31, 2020. Total non-performing loans held-in-portfolio decreased by $40 million from December 31, 2020. BPPR&#8217;s NPLs decreased by $34 million, driven by lower mortgage NPLs by $24 million, reflective of the resumption of consistent loan payments following the end of the COVID-19 moratorium period. BPPR&#8217;s construction NPLs decreased by $7 million mostly due to a previously reserved loan that was partially charged-off during the quarter. Popular Bank&#8217;s NPLs decreased by $5 million, mostly related to a commercial loan transferred to loans-held-for-sale and loan collection activity. Excluding government guaranteed loans, at March 31, 2021, the Corporation had 122,216 loans with an aggregate book value of $6.8 billion that had completed their COVID-19 moratorium period, of which 114,900 loans, or 94%, with an aggregate book value of $6.5 billion were current in their payments. At March 31, 2021, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 2.4% compared to 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) decreased by $11 million, mostly due to the resumption of sales and the suspension of foreclosure activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At March 31, 2021, NPLs secured by real estate amounted to $596 million in the Puerto Rico operations and $33 million in Popular U.S. These figures were $630 million and $34 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. 

The Corporation&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) amounted to $7.8 billion at March 31, 2021, of which $1.8 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, compared with $7.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. CRE NPLs amounted to $168 million at March 31, 2021, compared with $173 million at December 31, 2020. The CRE NPL ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments were 4.50% and 0.02%, respectively, at March 31, 2021, compared with 4.51% and 0.07%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. 

In addition to the NPLs included in Table 16, at March 31, 2021, there were $228 million of performing loans, mostly commercial loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing and are considered impaired (December 31, 2020 - $228 million). 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, total inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio, excluding consumer loans, remained flat at approximately $84 million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2020. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment decreased by $15 million, or 18%, compared to the same period in 2020, driven by lower mortgage inflows by $18 million. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. segment increased by $14 million from the same period in 2020, mostly due to due to higher construction inflows related to a loan that reached 90 days past due during its renewal process. As of March 31, 2021, the loan was current.

[1] There were $4 million in non-performing commercial loans held-for-sale as of March 31, 2021 and $3 million as of December 31, 2020. 

[2] It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. The balance of these loans includes $29 million at March 31, 2021 related to the rebooking of loans previously pooled into GNMA securities, in which the Corporation had a buy-back option as further described below (December 31, 2020 - $57 million). Under the GNMA program, issuers such as BPPR have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to repurchases option are required to be reflected (rebooked) on the financial statements of BPPR with an offsetting liability. While the borrowers for our serviced GNMA portfolio benefited from the moratorium, the delinquency status of these loans continued to be reported to GNMA without considering the moratorium. These balances include $341 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of March 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020 - $329 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $58 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31, 2020 - $60 million).

[1] Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.9 billion of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as of March 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020 - $1.1 billion). Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of guaranteed loans. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation, management considers current conditions, macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period, historical loss experience, portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics, results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans, and regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

&#160; 

The Corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries or markets. Other factors that can affect management&#8217;s estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold, may also affect the required level of the ACL. Consequently, the business financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations could also be affected. 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2021, the ACL for the Corporation&#8217;s loans held-in-portfolio amounted to $801 million, a decrease of $95 million, when compared with December 31, 2020, mainly prompted by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The ACL incorporated updated economic stimulus assumptions that contributed to a more optimistic view of the economy compared to the fourth quarter 2020 scenarios, prompting substantial reductions in reserves across different portfolios. The ACL for BPPR decreased by $58 million to $682 million, while the ACL for PB decreased by $37 million to $119 million, when compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease in the reserve for PB was partially offset with qualitative reserves aimed at addressing uncertainties mainly in the commercial real estate portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the loans-held-in portfolio for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 amounted to a benefit of $75.8 million, decreasing by $264.8 million from the same period in the prior year, amid improved macroeconomic outlook and lower NCOs.

NCOs for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 amounted to $21.0 million, decreasing by $41.5 million when compared to the same period in 2020. The BPPR segment NCOs decreased by $40.0 million mainly driven by lower consumer NCOs by $43.5 million, aided by measures taken by the Corporation to control the impact of the pandemic, as well as the U.S. government stimulus programs, and $7.6 million in recoveries recorded from the sale of fully charged-off loans during the first quarter of 2021. The PB segment NCOs amounted to $1.6 million, decreasing by $1.5 million, mainly driven by lower consumer. The Corporation continues to be attentive to the effect of the pandemic on our loan portfolios and changes in delinquencies and NCOs.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 

The Corporation&#8217;s troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) loans amounted to $1.7 billion at March 31, 2021, increasing by $39 million, or approximately 2.35%, from December 31, 2020, mainly related to mortgage borrowers that needed additional COVID extensions past the original 6-month moratorium period. TDRs in the BPPR segment increased by $40 million, mostly related to higher mortgage TDRs by $22 million, of which $20 million were related to government guaranteed loans, coupled with a combined increase of $20 million in the commercial and construction TDRs. The PB segment TDRs remained essentially flat at $16 million from December 31, 2020. TDRs in accruing status increased by $60 million from December 31, 2020, mostly related to an increase of $39 million and $22 million in BPPR&#8217;s mortgage and commercial TDRs, respectively, while non-accruing TDRs decreased by $21 million.
