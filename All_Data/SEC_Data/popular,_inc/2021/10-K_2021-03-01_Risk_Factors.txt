 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

&#160; 

We, like other financial institutions, face risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward- lookin g statement s contained in this report. 

The risks described in this report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to b e immaterial , or tha t are generall y applicabl e t o al l financia l institutions , als o ma y materiall y adversel y affec t ou r business , financia l condition , liquidity, result s of operations or capital position. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS and economic ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY 

&#160; 

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the global economy and the markets in which we operate, which has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operation. Its continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in the financial markets, significantly increased unemployment levels worldwide and decreased consumer confidence and commercial activity generally, including in the markets in which we do business, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to higher and more volatile credit loss expense and potential for increased charge-offs; loan and credit ratings downgrades; credit deterioration and defaults in many industries; a significant increase in the volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity markets; and a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities and other investment securities, which has led to decreased net interest income. 

&#160; 

In response to the pandemic, governments across the world, including the governments of Puerto Rico (our primary market), the United States Virgin Islands (&#8220;USVI&#8221;) and the British Virgin Islands (&#8220;BVI&#8221;), as well as state governments in the United States mainland, including New York, New Jersey and Florida, where Popular Bank (&#8220;PB&#8221;) has branches, ordered the temporary closure of many businesses, implemented mandatory curfews and the institution of social distancing, shelter in place and other health and safety requirements. Although many of these restrictive measures have been eased or lifted, allowing for the gradual reopening of the economy, certain restrictive measures remain in place and additional restrictive measures may be implemented in the future as a result of a resurgence in the spread of the virus or new strains of the virus. The restrictions imposed by governments in response to the outbreak caused significant disruption to economic activity and an increase in unemployment in the markets in which we operate, including Puerto Rico, which has been facing significant fiscal and economic challenges for over a decade. For more information, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further deterioration of the Puerto Rico, USVI, BVI and the broader U.S. economy would be expected to adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to comply with their financial obligations and adversely impact demand for our products and services. The disruption in economic activity could also adversely affect the financial condition of government entities in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI to which we have exposure. 

The COVID-19 pandemic also has significantly disrupted our operations and negatively impacted our business and financial condition. Many of BPPR&#8217;s and PB&#8217;s branches were temporarily closed in response to the pandemic. Currently, nearly all BPPR&#8217;s and PB&#8217;s branches are operating, in all instances subject to measures to preserve the health and safety of our employees and customers. To protect the health and safety of our workforce, we have facilitated a significant portion of our workforce to work remotely, which further exposes the Corporation to heightened risks with respect to cybersecurity, information security and other operational incidents, as well as our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls. Furthermore, although we have 

&#160; 

implemented a remote work protocol for many of our workers and instituted health and safety measures to protect employees that cannot work remotely, a disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to, or interact with, our customers could also result in losses or increased operational costs, regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, or harm our reputation. 

Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, beginning in March 2020, the Corporation implemented measures to provide financial relief to customers through programs such as payment moratoriums, suspensions of foreclosures and other collection activity, as well as waivers of certain fees and service charges. By the end of the third quarter of 2020 the Corporation had reinstated the imposition of these fees and service charges and resumed its delinquent loan collection efforts. The Federal Government also approved several economic stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic, including guaranteeing loans to small and medium-sized businesses through the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;). However, there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact. In addition, moratoriums imposed by Federal or state law or provided voluntarily by the Corporation may limit our ability to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that have benefited from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments. As of December 31, 2020, only 4,359 loans with an aggregate book value of $0.5 billion remained subject to payment moratoriums. For a discussion on the loan payment moratorium programs implemented by the Corporation to provide financial relief to customers during the pandemic, refer to the Allowance for Credit Losses section of the MD&#38;A in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such moratorium and stimulus programs have also imposed significant operational burdens on the Corporation, which also heighten the risk of operational incidents, including fraud and undetected errors. Our participation (or lack of participation) in certain governmental programs enacted in response to the pandemic, including the PPP, could further result in reputational harm, litigation and regulatory and other government action against the Corporation. For example, the Corporation may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Corporation regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications under the PPP and may be exposed to adverse action for the improper conduct of its employees in connection with such loans. Furthermore, the Corporation may also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans if the SBA determines that there have been deficiencies in the way a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Corporation, and denies its liability under the guaranty, reduces the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seeks recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Corporation. 

The Corporation&#8217;s financial results for the year 2020 reflect the impact of the business disruption and relief measures described above. For example, the Corporation&#8217;s revenue streams were impacted during the first and second quarters of the year as a result of reduced consumer transaction activity, lower interchange income, the waiver of certain late fees and service charges, as well as the suspension in mortgage origination and related securitization and loan sale activities. During 2020, the Corporation also incurred additional expenses related to front-line employee bonuses, the enabling of remote access for employees to work from home, the expansion of employee benefits, as well as the impact of specific measures to prevent the spread of the disease and efforts related to customer relief programs, among other related expenses. The Corporation&#8217;s financial results for the second half of 2020 reflect the impact of increased economic activity because of the gradual reopening of the economy and the related improvement in the macroeconomic environment, as well as the impact of the various government stimulus programs launched in response to the pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition (including our provision for credit losses, net charge offs, regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and the liquidity of the bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries), as well as the operations of our clients, customers, service providers and suppliers, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict at this time, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the appearance of new strains of the virus and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, such as the speed and effectiveness of vaccination programs and the nature and length of economic stimulus initiatives. To the extent the pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section. 

A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. 

Our credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted as of December 31, 2020 for approximately 82% of our total assets, 84% of our deposits and 81% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal years 2007 

&#160; 

and 2018 (inclusive), except fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the &#8220;Planning Board&#8221;) estimates, published in June 2020, the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 3.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The Planning Board estimates that real GNP increased approximately 1.5% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Mar&#237;a, and that it decreased by approximately -5.4% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. The Planning Board projected that the negative effects of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2% in the current fiscal year. 

&#160; 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s government has also been facing significant fiscal challenges that may have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The historical structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures, on the one hand, and unfunded legacy pension obligations, on the other hand, coupled with the Commonwealth&#8217;s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on and eventually seeking to restructure their debts and for the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in June 2016. PROMESA, among other things, established a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provided to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For a discussion of risks related to the Corporation&#8217;s credit exposure to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, see the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&#38;A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The credit quality of BPPR&#8217;s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The Commonwealth&#8217;s prolonged recession resulted in limited loan demand and in an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the future could affect many of our individual customers and customers&#8217; businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. Fiscal adjustments have resulted and may continue to result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues. 

&#160; 

If global or local economic conditions worsen, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including completing an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. 

Further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial, mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations. 

The value of properties in some of the markets we serve, in particular in Puerto Rico, declined during the past decade as a result of adverse economic conditions. Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our commercial , mortgage loan and construction loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 27%, 27% and 3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans secured by real estate , mortgage loans and construction loans, respectively. 

&#160; 

Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the USVI , the BVI or th e U.S . mainland , th e performanc e of ou r loa n portfoli o an d th e collatera l valu e backin g th e transaction s ar e dependen t upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. General economic conditions in Puerto Rico (as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic) and fiscal reforms aimed at addressing the current fiscal crisis could cause a further deterioration of the value of the real estate collateral securing our loan portfolios. 

A further deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependen t impaire d loan s woul d requir e increase s i n ou r provision for loa n losse s an d allowanc e for loa n losses . An y suc h increas e woul d hav e a n advers e effec t on our futur e financia l condition an d result s of operations .

&#160; 

&#160; 

Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. 

Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puert o Ric o law s or regulation s (or laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we may do business, such as California) , including any changes implemented by the new administration, coul d hav e a substantia l impac t on ou r operations . Additiona l law s an d regulation s ma y b e enacte d or adopte d i n th e futur e tha t could significantl y affec t our powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further , regulator s i n th e performanc e of thei r supervisor y an d enforcemen t duties , hav e significan t discretion an d powe r t o preven t or remed y unsaf e an d unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power c ould have a negative impact on Popular. Furthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal and economic problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its obligations under PROMESA. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS 

The fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions. A reduction in Puerto Rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income. 

We have direct and indirect lending and investment exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities. A deterioration of the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic condition, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and/or actions taken by the Commonwealth government or the Oversight Board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico, could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our Puerto Rico government obligations, as well as the value and performance of commercial, mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action, resulting in losses to us. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2020, our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations was limited to obligations from various municipalities and amounted to $377 million. Of the amount outstanding at December 31, 2020, $342 million consisted of loans and $35 million consisted of securities. These municipal obligations are mostly general obligations backed by property tax revenues and to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or &#8220;special obligations&#8221;, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. In addition, at December 31, 2020, the Corporation had $317 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental. For additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&#38;A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

BPPR&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the Puerto Rico government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal crisis and the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings under PROMESA. Similarly, BPPR&#8217;s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, BPPR has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. A portion of such deposits could also be used by the Commonwealth as part of its debts restructuring agreements under Title III of PROMESA. While a significant decrease in these deposits should not materially affect our liquidity since such deposits are collateralized, a significant decrease in the amount of such deposits could adversely affect our net interest income. 

&#160; 

BPPR also has operations in the USVI and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. At December 31, 2020, BPPR&#8217;s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $105 million, of which $70 million is outstanding. The USVI has been experiencing several fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. For additional information on the 

&#160; 

Corporation&#8217;s exposure to the USVI government, refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section in the MD&#38;A section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments, including those that investigate mortgage-related conduct. 

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time self-report compliance matters to, or receive requests for information from, departments of the U.S. and Puerto Rico governments. BPPR has received subpoenas and other requests for information from the departments of the U.S. government that investigate mortgage-related conduct, mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in Puerto Rico. BPPR has also self-identified and reported to applicable regulators matters with respect to mortgage related practices. 

&#160; 

For example, in July 2017, management learned that certain letters related to approximately 23,000 residential mortgage loans generated by Popular to comply with Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) rules requiring written notification to borrowers who have submitted a loss mitigation application were not mailed to borrowers over a period of up to approximately three-years due to a systems interface error. Loss mitigation is a process whereby creditors work with mortgage loan borrowers who are having difficulties making their loan payments on their debt. Popular corrected the systems interface error that caused the letters not to be sent, notified applicable regulators (including the CFPB), completed a review of its mortgage files to assess the scope of potential customer impact and conducted outreach and remediation efforts with respect to borrowers potentially affected by the systems interface error. 

&#160; 

Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities (whether arising from these incidents or otherwise) may result in judgments, settlements, fines, enforcement actions, penalties or other sanctions adverse to the Corporation which could materially and adversely affect the Corporation&#8217;s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. 

&#160; 

We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements. 

Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage- backed security . We hav e furthermore retained , throug h recours e arrangements , par t of th e credi t ris k on sale s of mortgag e loans , an d w e als o servic e certai n mortgag e loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2020, we serviced $0.9 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated wit h Fannie Mae an d Freddi e Ma c programs . I n th e even t of an y custome r default , pursuan t t o th e credi t recours e provided , w e ar e require d t o repurchas e th e loa n or reimburse th e thir d - part y investor for th e incurre d loss .

During 2020, we repurchased approximately $161 mi llion in mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformanc e b y th e borrower , w e hav e right s t o th e underlyin g collatera l securin g th e mortgag e loan .

&#160; 

Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition. 

In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to , amon g othe r things , compliance with laws and regulations, underwriting standards, the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan. 

&#160; 

A loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan , an d b e unsalabl e or salabl e onl y a t a significan t discount . I f suc h a loa n i s sol d befor e w e detec t non -compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduc e ou r cas h availabl e for operation s an d liquidity . 

&#160; 

Managemen t believe s tha t i t ha s establishe d control s t o ensur e tha t loan s ar e originate d i n accordanc e wit h the secondary market&#8217;s requirements , bu t mistake s ma y b e made , or certai n employee s ma y deliberatel y violat e ou r lendin g policies .

&#160; 

As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity. 

We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include declaring dividends to our shareholders of our common stock, capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. Based on its current financial condition, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operation and capital position and may affect our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Additionally, continued adverse macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in further restrictions from regulators on dividends and repurchases of our common stock, which could limit the capital we return to our shareholders. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market. 

&#160; 

Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 

Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC&#8217;s DIF and, as a result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failure s, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or ou r capita l position i s impaired , w e ma y b e require d t o pa y eve n highe r FDI C premium s. An y futur e increase s or specia l assessment s ma y materiall y adversel y affec t ou r result s of operations. See the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;FDIC Insurance&#8221; discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and PB. 

&#160; 

Our business is susceptible to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. Reforms to and uncertainty regarding the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates. Since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes in rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Interest rates are also highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately, including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies, particularly the Federal Reserve. For a discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s interest rate sensitivity, please refer to the &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; section of the MD&#38;A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the LIBOR administration announced that it would consider continuing publication of certain US dollar LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023, subject to applicable regulations. In response to this announcement, Federal regulators issued a statement that, among other things, encouraged all financial institutions to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. As a result of this transition, interest rates on floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments held by the Corporation and tied to LIBOR rates, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in disruption in the financial markets. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates. 

&#160; 

Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is difficult to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. Furthermore, the contractual documents governing the Corporation&#8217;s LIBOR-linked financial instruments may not provide effective fallback language in the event LIBOR rates cease to be published, which may present the Corporation with legal and regulatory risk if, for example, the Corporation is unable to amend these financial instruments prior to such cessation. 

If our goodwill, deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations. 

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $671 million, $851 million and $16 million, respectively, of goodwill, net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet.

The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax-planning strategies. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on the expected profitability of our businesses may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our Puerto Rico and U.S. operations.

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators. 

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking agencies and the SEC, to adopt rules prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and PB). The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which 

&#160; 

have not been finalized. Compliance with such revised rules may substantially affect the way in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. For a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules, see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8212;Incentive Compensation&#8221; section in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Th e scop e an d conten t of th e U.S . bankin g regulators &#8217; policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy. 

&#160; 

We are subject to risk related to our own credit rating ; action s b y th e ratin g agencie s or havin g capita l level s belo w well -capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter int o hedgin g agreement s i n th e futur e an d ma y hav e othe r advers e effect s on ou r business.

We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. 

Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off - balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and othe r factors . I f w e fai l t o mee t thes e minimu m capita l guideline s an d othe r regulator y requirements , ou r busines s an d financia l condition wil l b e materiall y an d adversely affected .

&#160; 

In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published Basel IV in December 2017. Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on us will depend on the way the revisions are implemented in the U.S. See the 

&#160; 

&#8220;Supervision and Regulation &#8211; Capital Adequacy&#8221; discussion in Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information related to the Basel III Capital Rules and Basel IV. 

&#160; 

The resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. 

We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financia l institution s remai n high . Substantia l lega l liabilit y or significan t regulator y action agains t u s coul d hav e materia l advers e financia l effect s or caus e significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 23 - &#8220; Commitments &#38; Contingencies&#8221; , to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks. If we, and our subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers, are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and penalties, and other regulatory actions, as well as governmental investigations. 

As a federally regulated financial institution, we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) of the U.S. Treasury, as well as anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including those under the Bank Secrecy Act. 

&#160; 

Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. We are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports, that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities. In addition, as a financial institution we are required to, among other things, identify our customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions. Failure by the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or third-party service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Corporation, including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action, including significant civil and criminal penalties. We can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. The markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks. 

We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations. With respect to OFAC regulations and economic and trade sanction programs, these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person&#8217;s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable, blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers&#8217; customers that may involve a sanctioned person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

From time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified, blocked or rejected by our policies, controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC. There can be no assurances that any failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes, or with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, if the policies, controls, and procedures of one of the Corporation&#8217;s third-party service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us, and, in the case of EVERTEC, could adversely affect the value of our investment in EVERTEC. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS 

We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks, that if realized, may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees&#8217; remote work capabilities and in the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data. We employ a layered defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as the threats from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe. T he risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and Popular&#8217;s internal use of internet-based products and applications. 

&#160; 

We continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures. We have been the target of phishing attacks in the past, targeting both our customers and employees through brand and email impersonation, that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees. We continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such events, while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns. There can be no assurances, however, that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Furthermore, increased use of remote access and third-party video conferencing solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees, and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers, could increase our exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by Popular&#8217;s employees. 

&#160; 

The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems and extract funds from customer&#8217;s credit cards or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking, such as mobile banking and other technology-based products and services used by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, we have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. 

&#160; 

A successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, if personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled, misused or stolen, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have 

&#160; 

released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 &#8212; Business, included in this Form 10-K. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties. 

&#160; 

We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security, technology and business process services. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under &#8220;Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.&#8221; The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties&#8217; suppliers or vendors (so-called &#8220;fourth party risk&#8221;). We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us. 

&#160; 

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. 

&#160; 

If Popular&#8217;s operational systems, or those of external parties on which Popular&#8217;s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, Popular could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. 

Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. The most important of these third-party service providers for us is EVERTEC, and certain risks particular to EVERTEC are discussed below under &#8220;Risks Relating to Our Relationship with EVERTEC.&#8221; While we select third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions and we may also be subject to long-term contracts with certain of these vendors (including EVERTEC) that, for example, limit our ability to replace these vendors. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor, breaches of a vendor&#8217;s systems, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor&#8217;s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. In addition, the assessment and management by financial institutions of the risks associated with third party vendors have been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our oversight of third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities. Our failure to properly manage risks associated to our third-party relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by our regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. 

&#160; 

Unforeseen or catastrophic events, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters or the emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Climate change could also have a material adverse impact on our business operations and that of our clients and customers. 

The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events in the markets in which we do business, including extreme weather events and other natural disasters, man-made disasters, or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations 

&#160; 

and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our operations are located in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI, a region susceptible to hurricanes, earthquakes and other similar events. For example, in 2017, our operations in Puerto Rico, the USVI and BVI were significantly disrupted by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In January 2020, Puerto Rico was impacted by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. Future natural disasters can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We maintain insurance against natural disasters including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic natural disaster could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Further, future natural disasters in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. The frequency, severity and impact of future hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, epidemics and other similar events are difficult to predict. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, we operate in regions, countries and communities where our business and the activities and operations of our clients and customers may be further disrupted by global climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change include the increase in the frequency and severity of weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, and long-term shifts in climate patters, such as sustained higher and lower temperatures, sea level rise, heat waves and droughts, among others. These events may cause disruptions in our business and operations and the destruction of our properties and assets. Furthermore, these severe weather events may also disrupt the businesses and operations of our clients and customers and damage the properties and assets of our borrowers, adversely affecting the financial condition of our clients and customers and the value of any collateral held by us. Losses resulting from these disasters and severe weather events may make it more difficult for our borrowers to timely repay their loans. If these events occur, we may experience a decrease in the value of our loan portfolio and our revenue, and may incur in additional operational expenses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the impact of climate change in the markets that we operate and in other global markets may have the effect of increasing the costs or reducing the availability of insurance needed for our business operations. Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks, which we may be subject to, may include changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change. These climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and on our business and financial performance and those of our clients and customers. 

&#160; 

risks related to acquisition transactions 

&#160; 

Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. 

To the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we may pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. Acquiring other banks or businesses, however, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If in connection with an acquisition we pay a premium over book or market value, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Similarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and th e valu e of th e rea l estat e an d othe r asset s servin g a s collatera l for th e repaymen t of secure d loans . In estimating the extent of the loss es , we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased los s reserve s ma y b e neede d t o respon d t o differen t economi c condition s or advers e development s i n th e acquire d loa n portfolios , which would negatively affect our operating results. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Finally, certain acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTEC 

We are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. 

In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the &#8220;MSA&#8221;) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology and security services. The term of the MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal over certain services or products and development projects related to the services thereunder provided. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing, security and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to operational, cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

As a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC&#8217;s systems or internal controls environment, including as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, vulnerabilities, obsolescence or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by EVERTEC, as well as cyber breaches, system breakdowns and instances of application obsolescence. The continuance or increase in service delays or interruptions, vulnerabilities in EVERTEC&#8217;s information systems, or cyberattacks to, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, expose us to regulatory, legal and compliance risk and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For further information regarding our cybersecurity risks, refer to the &#8220;We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business&#8221; risk factor. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA, including the failure to meet the service levels provided for therein, may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach. 

Popular faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry. If EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We operate in a highly competitive environment in which we must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of technological advances. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. We compete on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price, ease of use, reputation and transaction execution. To compete effectively, we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors, including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services . These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success dependent on EVERTEC&#8217;s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. 

&#160; 

Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers&#8217; compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the 

&#160; 

technology provider. Because of our contractual relationship with EVERTEC, however, we may be required to bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA. 

&#160; 

Moreover, the terms, speed, scalability and functionality of certain of EVERTEC&#8217;s technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors. Evertec&#8217;s failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce Popular&#8217;s revenues, place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

A transition to a new financial services technology provider, and the replacement of services currently provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex. 

Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. Upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by EVERTEC to a new financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of an early termination thereunder, these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. Furthermore, we may require transition assistance from EVERTEC beyond the term of the MSA, delaying and lengthening any transition process away from EVERTEC while increasing related costs. 

Under the MSA, we are required to provide written notice of non-renewal no less than one year prior to the relevant termination date avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier and such process may extend beyond the current term of the MSA. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term. 

We continue to have a 16.16% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2020, our share of EVERTEC&#8217;s changes in equity recognized in income was $17.8 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2020, approximately $86 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC&#8217;s revenues (approximately 47% for 2020). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC&#8217;s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC&#8217;s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 22% of EVERTEC&#8217;s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC&#8217;s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, or be terminated, EVERTEC&#8217;s business may be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES 

&#160; 

Dividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares. 

Holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally availabl e for suc h payments . Durin g 2009 , w e suspende d dividen d payment s on ou r 

&#160; 

Common Stoc k an d Preferre d Stock . W e resume d paymen t of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods. 

&#160; 

This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common stock over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 

&#160; 

In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declarin g or payin g an y dividend s or distribution s on ou r capita l stock , includin g ou r Common Stoc k an d Preferre d Stock, or fro m purchasing, acquiring , or makin g a liquidation paymen t on suc h stock , i f w e hav e give n notic e of ou r election t o defe r interes t payment s bu t th e relate d deferra l perio d ha s no t yet commence d or a deferra l perio d i s continuing. 

&#160; 

Accordingly, stockholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Stockholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment. 

&#160; 

Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. 

Until our existing classified Board of Directors structure is fully phased out beginning with our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes. At the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, one- thir d of th e member s of th e Boar d of Director s wil l b e electe d for a term expiring at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a term expiring at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter directors will be elected annually. Therefore, u ntil our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholder s onl y for caus e b y a vot e of a t leas t tw o - third s of th e combine d votin g powe r of th e outstandin g capita l stoc k entitle d t o vot e for th e election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control . Thes e provision s als o ma y ten d t o discourag e attempt s b y thir d partie s t o acquir e Popula r becaus e of th e additiona l tim e an d expens e involve d an d a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.
