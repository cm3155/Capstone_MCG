 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This report includes management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of the consolidated financial position and financial performance of Popular, Inc. (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221; or &#8220;Popular&#8221;). All accompanying tables, financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report should be considered an integral part of this analysis. 

&#160; 

The Corporation is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) mainland and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#8220;BPPR&#8221;), as well as investment banking, broker-dealer, auto and equipment leasing and financing, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. In the U.S. mainland, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage, equipment leasing and financing, and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (&#8220;PB&#8221;), which has branches located in New York, New Jersey and Florida and its subsidiaries . In addition, BPPR provides certain lending activities in the U.S. through its New York Branch. Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents information about the Corporation&#8217;s business segments. 

&#160; 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Key Customer Channels and Amendments to Commercial Contracts with Evertec and Subsequent Sale of Remaining Ownership Stake in Evertec 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2022, BPPR completed its previously announced acquisition of certain assets from Evertec Group, LLC (&#8220;Evertec Group&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Evertec, Inc. (&#8220;Evertec&#8221;), to service certain BPPR channels (&#8220;Business Acquisition Transaction&#8221;). 

&#160; 

As a result of the closing of the Business Acquisition Transaction, BPPR acquired from Evertec Group certain critical channels, including BPPR&#8217;s retail and business digital banking and commercial cash management applications. In connection with the Business Acquisition Transaction, BPPR also entered into amended and restated service agreements with Evertec Group pursuant to which Evertec Group will continue to provide various information technology and transaction processing services to Popular, BPPR and their respective subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Under the amended service agreements, Evertec Group no longer has exclusive rights to provide certain of Popular&#8217;s technology services. The amended service agreements include discounted pricing and lowered caps on contractual pricing escalators tied to the Consumer Price Index. As part of the transaction, BPPR and Evertec also entered into a revenue sharing structure for BPPR in connection with its merchant acquiring relationship with Evertec. Under the terms of the amended and restated Master Servicing Agreement (&#8220;MSA&#8221;), Evertec will be entitled to receive monthly payments from the Corporation to the extent that Evertec&#8217;s revenues, covered under the MSA, fall below certain agreed annualized minimum amounts. 

&#160; 

As consideration for the Business Acquisition Transaction, BPPR delivered to Evertec Group 4,589,169 shares of Evertec common stock valued at closing at $169.2 million (based on Evertec&#8217;s stock price on June 30, 2022 of $36.88). A total of $144.8 million of the consideration for the transaction was attributed to the acquisition of the critical channels of which $28.7 million were attributed to Software Intangible Assets and $116.1 million were attributed to goodwill. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The remaining $24.2 million was attributed to the renegotiation of the Master Services Agreement (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) with Evertec and was recorded as an expense. The Corporation also recorded a credit of $6.9 million in Evertec billings under the MSA during the third quarter of 2022 as a result of the Business Acquisition Transaction, resulting in a net expense charge for the quarter of $17.3 million. 

&#160; 

On August 15, 2022, the Corporation completed the sale of its remaining 7,065,634 shares of common stock of Evertec (the &#8220;Evertec Stock Sale&#8221;, and collectively with the Business Acquisition Transaction, the &#8220;Evertec Transactions&#8221;). Following the Evertec Stock Sale, Popular no longer owns any Evertec common stock. The impact of the gain on the sale of Evertec shares used as consideration for the Business Acquisition Transaction in exchange for the acquired applications on July 1, 2022 and the net expense associated with the renegotiation of the MSA resulted in an after-tax gain of $97.9 million, while the Evertec Stock Sale and 

&#160; 

the related accounting adjustments resulted in an after-tax gain of $128.8 million, recorded during the third quarter of 2022, for an aggregate after-tax gain of $226.6 million. 

&#160; 

Capital Actions 

&#160; 

On July 12, 2022, the Corporation completed its previously announced accelerated share repurchase (&#8220;ASR&#8221;) program for the repurchase of an aggregate $400 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock, for which an initial 3,483,942 shares were delivered in March 2022 (the &#8220;March ASR Agreement&#8221;). Upon the final settlement of the March ASR Agreement, the Corporation received an additional 1,582,922 shares of common stock and recognized approximately $120 million as treasury stock with a corresponding increase in its capital surplus account. The Corporation repurchased a total of 5,066,864 shares at an average purchase price of $78.9443 under the March ASR Agreement. 

&#160; 

On August 25, 2022, the Corporation announced that, on August 24, 2022, it entered into another ASR agreement to repurchase an aggregate of $231 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;August ASR Agreement&#8221;). The $231 million in Popular&#8217;s common stock being repurchased pursuant to the August ASR Agreement is equal to the sum of the remaining $100 million in common stock repurchases contemplated as part of the Corporation&#8217;s 2022 capital actions, announced on January 12, 2022, and the after-tax gain recognized by the Corporation as a result of the sale of its remaining shares common stock of Evertec, announced on August 15, 2022. Under the terms of the August ASR Agreement, on August 26, 2022, the Corporation made an initial payment of $231 million and received an initial delivery of 2,339,241 shares of Popular&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;Initial Shares&#8221;). The transaction was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction. Furthermore, as a result of the receipt of the Initial Shares, the Corporation recognized in stockholders&#8217; equity approximately $185 million in treasury stock and $46 million as a reduction of capital surplus. Upon the final settlement of the August ASR Agreement, the Corporation expects to further adjust its treasury stock and capital surplus accounts to reflect the final delivery or receipt of cash or shares, which will depend on the volume-weighted average price of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock during the term of the August ASR Agreement, less a discount. The final settlement of the August ASR Agreement is expected to occur no later than the fourth quarter of 2022. 

&#160; 

Hurricanes Fiona and Ian 

&#160; 

On September 18, 2022, Hurricane Fiona made landfall in the southwest area of Puerto Rico as a Category 1 hurricane, bringing record rainfall and flooding throughout the island and affecting communities where BPPR does business. Hurricane Fiona&#8217;s rain and winds caused a complete blackout on the island and caused considerable damage to certain sectors in the southwest region. President Biden issued a disaster declaration for the island. While the impact to BPPR&#8217;s operation was not material, certain customers, highly concentrated in certain municipalities, were impacted by the disaster. 

&#160; 

As part of hurricane relief efforts on the island, the Corporation waived late-payment fees on individual lending products from September 16 through October 31, 2022. Popular also waived, through September 30, withdrawal fees payable by our customers at ATMs outside of the Popular network and fees payable by customers of other banking institutions at Popular&#8217;s ATMs. In addition, the Corporation has offered to clients impacted by the hurricane a moratorium of up to three monthly payments, up to December 31, 2022, on personal and commercial credit cards, auto loans, leases and personal loans, subject to certain eligibility requirements. Mortgage clients may also benefit from different payment relief alternatives available, depending on their type of loan. Loan relief options for commercial clients are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160; 

Separately, on September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian made a landfall on the west coast of central Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, causing extensive floods and destruction in the impacted areas in Florida. President Biden made a major disaster declaration for certain counties in central Florida. PB and BPPR do not have significant operations in the area but have some limited retail and commercial clients who reside or have business activities in the impacted areas. 

&#160; 

For clients impacted by the hurricane that reside in counties in Florida declared as disaster zones by President Biden, Popular has offered a moratorium for up to three payments, up to January 31, 2023, subject to certain eligibility requirements. As in the case of Puerto Rico, relief options for commercial clients are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160; 

The Corporation is still evaluating the impact of Hurricanes Fiona and Ian. However, given the hurricanes&#8217; limited impact in the markets in which Popular does business and low level of assistance requests received by the Corporation to date, the effect on credit risk should not be significant. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Transfer of Securities from Available-for Sale to Held-To-Maturity 

&#160; 

In October 2022, the Corporation transferred U.S. Treasury securities with a fair value of $6.5 billion (par value of $7.4 billion) from its available-for-sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio. This transaction was accounted for during the fourth quarter of 2022, when management changed its intent to hold these securities to maturity to reduce the impact on accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) and tangible capital of further increases in interest rates. The Corporation has the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. 

&#160; 

The securities were reclassified at fair value at the time of the transfer. At the date of the transfer, these securities had pre-tax unrealized losses of $873.1 million recorded in AOCI. This fair value discount will be accreted to interest income and the unrealized loss remaining in AOCI will be amortized, offsetting each other through the remaining life of the securities. There were no realized gains or losses recorded as a result of this transfer. 

&#160; 

While changes in the amount of unrealized gains and losses in AOCI have an impact on the Corporation&#8217;s and its wholly-owned banking subsidiaries&#8217; tangible capital ratios, a non-GAAP measure, they do not impact regulatory capital ratios, in accordance with the regulatory framework. 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

Table 1 provides selected financial data and performance indicators for the quarters and nine months-periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 

&#160; 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and sponsored entities, certain obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and/or its agencies and municipalities and assets held by the Corporation&#8217;s international banking entities. To facilitate the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense and other related expense disallowances required by Puerto Rico tax law. Thereunder, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is presented with its different components in Tables 2 and 3, along with the reconciliation to net interest income (GAAP), for the quarter and nine month-period ended September 30, 2022 as compared with the same period in 2021, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

Financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 

&#61623; For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded net income of $ 422.4 million , compared to net income of $ 248.1 mi llion for the same quarter of the previous year. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 3.32%, an increase of 55 basis points when compared to 2.77% for the same quarter of the previous year, mainly due to higher volume of loans, higher interest rate environment, and the change in mix of the money markets and investment portfolio. On a taxable equivalent basis, the net interest margin was of 3.71%, compared to 3.04% for the same quarter of the previous year. The Corporation recorded a provision for credit losses of $39.6 million, compared to a benefit of $61.2 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The higher provision for 2022 is attributed to the macroeconomic outlook and portfolio growth. The 2021 

&#160; 

period also included releases of credit loss reserves related to the macroeconomic uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Non-interest income was $426.5 million for the quarter, an increase of $257.2 million when compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2021 mainly due to the gain of $257.7 million from the Evertec Transactions, discussed above. Operating expenses were higher by $87.9 million principally due to higher personnel costs, professional fees, $17.3 million expenses associated with the Evertec Transactions and a goodwill impairment charge of $9 million . 

&#61623; Total assets at September 30, 2022 amounted to $70.7 billion, compared to $75.1 billion, at December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to lower money market investments, due to a decrease in deposits, partially offset by higher debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity and loan growth. 

&#61623; Total deposits at September 30, 2022 decreased by $2.2 billion when compared to deposits at December 31, 2021, mainly due to lower Puerto Rico public sector deposits by $2.9 billion, partially offset by growth in other deposits sectors. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $3.7 billion at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $2.3 billion when compared to December 31, 2021, principally due to an increase in accumulated unrealized losses on debt securities available-for-sale by $2.4 billion due to a decline in fair value of fixed-rate debt securities as a result of the rising interest rate environment, the impact of the $400 million March ASR Agreement, the $231 million August ASR Agreement, declared quarterly common stock dividends, and preferred stock dividends, partially offset by the net income of $845.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

&#61623; At September 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book value per common share was $38.69, a reduction of $26.6 from December 31, 2021 due mainly to the reduction in Stockholders&#8217; equity during the period, offset in part by the benefit of the common stock repurchases under the ASR Agreements. 

&#61623; Capital ratios continued to be strong. As of September 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 16.04%, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.65%, and the total capital ratio was 17.92%. Refer to Table 8 for capital ratios.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 

&#160; 

The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and general practices within the financial services industry. Various elements of the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Corporation&#8217;s Audit Committee. The Corporation has identified as critical accounting policies those related to: (i) Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality; (iv) Income Taxes; (v) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets; and (vi) Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations. For a summary of these critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to that particular section in the MD&#38;A included in Popular, Inc.&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. Also, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2021 Form 10-K for a summary of the Corporation&#8217;s significant accounting policies and to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for information on recently adopted accounting standard updates.

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income for the third quarter of 2022 was $579.6 million, an increase of $90.2 million when compared to $489.4 million for the same quarter of 2021. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $646.6 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $536.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $110.3 million. 

Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 3.32%, an increase of 55 basis points when compared to 2.77% for the same quarter of the previous year. The increase in the net interest margin is mainly due to higher earning assets yields due to a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by an increase in deposit cost. The net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the third quarter of 2022 was 3.71%, an increase of 67 basis points when compared to 3.04% for the same quarter of 2021. The detailed variances of the increase in net interest income are described below: 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Higher interest income from money market, investment and trading securities by $94.6 million mainly due to a higher yield at 2.31% compared to 1.25% in the third quarter of 2021 related to a higher interest rate environment and the investment in U.S. Treasury securities which are exempt for income tax purposes under the Puerto Rico&#8217;s Internal Revenue Code. The interest rate received on excess reserves at the Federal Reserve increased by to 2.18% compared to 0.15% in the same quarter in 2021; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from commercial loans by $26.0 million due to a higher average volume by $1.5 billion and higher yield by 16 basis points related to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate loans and originations. 

&#61623; The auto and lease financing portfolios interest income increased by $2.5 million due to higher average volume by $376.0 million, partially offset by lower yield due to a high volume of originations in a prolonged low interest rate environment and lower premium amortization on previously acquired portfolios; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from consumer loans by $15.7 million due to higher average volume by $383.0 million and higher yield by 46 basis points mainly related to higher interest income from personal loans and credit cards loans by $9.0 million and $6.4 million, respectively; and 

Partially offset by: 

&#61623; Higher interest expense on deposits by $33.9 million and higher yield by 29 basis points mainly due to NOW and money market deposits&#8217; higher interest expense and yield by $28.5 million and 45 basis points, respectively, driven mainly from Puerto Rico government and commercial deposits. 

Prepayment penalties, late fees collected and the amortization of premiums on purchased loans are included as part of the loan yield. Interest income related to these items for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $7.4 million and 

&#160; 

$27.0 million, respectively. The decrease of $19.6 million is mainly related to lower amortized fees resulting from the forgiveness of PPP loans of $1.9 million compared to $19.9 million in the third quarter of 2021. 

Approximately 27% of the Corporation&#8217;s deposits are public fund deposits from the Government of Puerto Rico, Municipalities and government instrumentalities and corporations. These deposits are indexed to short term market rates and fluctuate in cost with changes in those rates with a one-quarter lag, in accordance with contractual terms. As a result, these deposits&#8217; costs have generally lagged variable asset repricing. Based on projected interest rate expectations and deposit volumes, we expect this condition to result in an increase in deposit costs in the fourth quarter of 2022 by approximately 150 basis points from current levels.

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.6 billion, or $151.5 million higher than the same period in 2021. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, or $178.3 million higher than the same period in 2021. Net interest margin was 3.05%, an increase of 13 basis points when compared to 2.92% in 2021. The increase in net interest margin is mainly driven by a higher yield of money market, investment and trading securities due to a higher interest rate environment. Net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was 3.39%, an increase of 16 basis points when compared to the 3.23% for the same period of 2021. The drivers of the variances in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were: 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Higher interest income from money market, investment, and trading securities by $145.2 million due to a higher average volume by $2.6 billion mainly due to purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, which are exempt for income tax purposes under the Puerto Rico&#8217;s Internal Revenue Code, and higher yield by 38 basis points mainly due to higher interest rate received on excess reserves at the Federal Reserve by 70 basis points. The increase in investments results from higher volume of deposits by $3.6 billion as a result of Covid-19 U.S. Government stimulus and other aids; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from commercial loans by $25.3 million mainly due to higher average volume by $770 million; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from the auto and lease financing portfolios by $8.3 million due to the increase in average volume by $404.0 million, partially offset by lower yield driven by the origination of loans in a prolonged low interest rate environment; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from consumer loans by $21.5 million mostly due to a higher average volume of personal loans and credit cards loans; 

Partially offset by: 

&#61623; Lower interest income from mortgage loans by $3.3 million driven by lower average volume mainly related to portfolio run-off; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher interest expense from deposits by $28.2 million mainly due to higher cost by seven basis points related to a higher interest rate environment. 

Prepayment penalties, late fees collected and the amortization of premiums on purchased loans are included as part of the loan yield. Interest income related to these items for the nine-months ended September 30, 2022, amounted to $36.3 million, compared to $69.7 million in the same period of 2021. The decrease in loan fee income was driven by PPP loan fees, which amounted to $16.6 million for the nine-months period ended September 30, 2022 versus $50.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and lower amortization recorded from the prepayment of previously purchased credit deteriorated loans and lower amortization on the auto loans portfolios acquired in previous years.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio and Unfunded Commitments 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded an expense of $39.9 million for its reserve for credit losses related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. The provision for credit loss related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 was $39.5 million, compared to the reserve release of $58.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The provision expense was mainly driven by higher loan volumes and changes in the macroeconomic scenarios. The provision related to unfunded commitments for the third quarter of 2022 was $0.4 million, compared to the reserve release related to unfunded commitments of $1.5 million for the same period of 2021. 

&#160; 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded a provision for credit loss of $28.7 million for loans-held-in-portfolio for the BPPR segment, compared to a reserve release of $36.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The Popular U.S. segment recorded a provision of $10.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to a reserve release of $22.7 million for the same quarter in 2021. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded a provision of $34.4 million for its reserve for credit losses related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. The provision related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $35.0 million, compared to the reserve release of $151.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The higher reserve release in 2021 reflected the improvements in the macroeconomic environment and outlook, at the time, and the related release of reserves accumulated during early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The provision for unfunded commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflected a benefit of $0.6 million, compared to a provision benefit of $7.5 million for the same period of 2021. 

The provision for credit losses for the BPPR segment was an expense of $25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a benefit of $98.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The Popular U.S. segment recorded a provision of $9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a reserve release of $53.5 million for the same period in 2021. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2022 , the total allowance for credit losses for loans held-in-portfolio amounted to $703.1 million, compared to $695.4 million as of December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.23% at September 30, 2022 , compared to 2.38% at December 31, 2021. As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, within the process to estimate its allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), the Corporation applies probability weightings to the outcomes of simulations using Moody&#8217;s Analytics&#8217; Baseline, S3 (pessimistic) and S1 (optimistic) scenarios. The baseline scenario is assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario given the uncertainties in the economic outlook and downside risk. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s methodology to estimate its allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;). Refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD&#38;A for a detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, the allowance for credit losses and selected loan losses statistics. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Provision for Credit Losses &#8211; Investment Securities 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s provision for credit losses related to its investment securities held-to-maturity is related to the portfolio of obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico, states and political subdivisions. For the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 , the provision for credit losses for investment securities was a reserve release of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, compared to a $1.0 million reserve release for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021 . At September 30, 2022 , the total allowance for credit losses for this portfolio amounted to $7.2 million, compared to $8.1 million as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ACL for this portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-Interest Income 

&#160; 

Non-interest income amounted to $426.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to $169.3 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The results for the third quarter of 2022 included the gain from the Evertec Transactions and the related accounting adjustments of $257.7 million. Other factors that contributed to the variance in non-interest income were: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other service fees by $6.0 million, principally at the BPPR segment, due to higher credit card fees by $4.4 million mainly in interchange income resulting from higher transactional volumes; and 

&#61623; higher income from mortgage banking activities by $1.1 million mainly due to a positive variance of $5.5 million in the fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) and lower realized losses on closed derivatives; partially offset by lower gain on sale of mortgage loans and securitization activity by $5.0 million. In August 2022, the Corporation decided to retain in portfolio (held-to-maturity) FHA-insured mortgage originations, rather than sell them as we have done in the past. As a result, our mortgage gain on sale fees will be lower, but our tax-exempt interest income will be higher; and 

&#61623; a favorable adjustment of $9.2 million in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to purchase price adjustments for the acquisition of the K2 Capital Group LLC business in 2021 (&#8216;&#8217;K2 Acquisition&#8217;&#8217;), as the Corporation updated its estimates related to the realizability of the earnings targets for the contingent payment; 

partially offset by: 

&#61623; lower service charges on deposit accounts by $1.3 million mainly due to the Corporation&#8217;s initiative of eliminating insufficient funds fees and modifying overdraft fees during the quarter; and 

&#61623; a gain of $7.0 million recorded in 2021 related to the sale and lease back of two corporate office buildings; and 

&#61623; lower earnings from the portfolio of equity method investments by $1.9 million, excluding Evertec. 

Non-interest income amounted to $738.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $477.5 million for the same period of the previous year. Non-interest income was impacted by the gain from the Evertec Transactions and related accounting adjustments, as discussed above. Other factors that contributed to the variance in non-interest income were: 

&#61623; higher other service fees by $17.5 million, principally at the BPPR segment, due to higher credit card fees mainly in interchange income resulting from higher volume of transactions; 

&#61623; higher income from mortgage banking activities by $2.8 million due to a favorable variance in the fair value adjustment of MSRs and higher gains on closed derivatives, offset by lower gain on securitization activity; 

&#61623; a favorable adjustment of $9.2 million in the fair value of the contingent consideration, discussed above; 

partially offset by 

&#61623; higher losses on equity securities by $9.2 million due mainly to securities held for deferred benefit plans, which have an offsetting positive variance in personnel costs; 

&#61623; a favorable variance in the adjustments for indemnity reserves for loans previously sold of $1.9 million; and 

&#61623; the gains recorded in 2021 for an aggregate of $7.0 million related to the sale and lease back of two corporate office buildings. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Operating Expenses 

&#160; 

Operating expenses amounted to $476.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $87.9 million, including a $17.3 million charge in connection with the Evertec Transactions and a $9.0 million impairment of goodwill related to the 2021 K2 Acquisition, when compared with the same quarter of 2021. The variance in operating expenses was driven primarily by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher personnel costs by $36.2 million mainly due to higher salaries as a result of market adjustments and annual salary revisions. The remaining increase in personnel costs is mainly related to an increase in medical insurance premiums, and higher incentives related to the profit-sharing and other incentive plans that are tied to the Corporation&#8217;s financial performance; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher net occupancy expenses by $2.5 million mainly due to BPPR&#8217;s property rent expenses; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher equipment expenses by $4.1 million due to higher software amortization expense; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher business promotion expenses by $6.2 million mainly due to higher customer reward program expense in our credit card business by $4.6 million, and donations by $1.3 million, including hurricane related donations; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating expenses by $22.1 million, mainly due to higher legal reserves and the $17.3 million expense related to the Evertec Transactions, net of the $6.9 million in credits received in connection with this transaction; 

&#160; 

&#61623; a goodwill impairment charge of $9.0 million due to a decrease in Popular Equipment Finance&#8217;s (PEF) projected earnings considered as part of the Corporation&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment analysis; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other professional fees by $7.5 mainly due to higher expense by $16.2 million related to corporate initiatives; 

&#160; 

partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower programming, processing, and other technology services by $9.8 million due to lower application hosting, IT consulting and related expenses and lower merchant processing fees reflecting savings as a result of the Evertec Transactions. 

&#160; 

Operating expenses amounted to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $152.8 million when compared with the same period of 2021, driven primarily by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher personnel cost by $58.3 million mainly due to higher salaries, higher incentives, and an increase in medical insurance premiums; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher equipment expense by $8.3 million due to higher software amortization expense; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating taxes by $5.8 million mainly due to higher personal property taxes; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher professional fees by $29.8 million mainly due to higher expense by $28.4 million related to corporate initiatives; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher business promotion expenses by $13.6 million mainly due to higher customer reward program expense in our credit card business by $11.1 million; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating expenses by $27.2 million, mainly due to higher pension plan costs, higher operating insurance expenses, and the $17.3 million expense related to the Evertec Transactions; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; a goodwill impairment charge of $9.0 million due to a decrease in PEF&#8217;s projected earnings considered as part of the Corporation&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment analysis.

Income Taxes 

For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $68.0 million and $182.7 million with an effective tax rate (&#8220;ETR&#8221;) of 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to $83.5 million and $235.5 million with an ETR of 25% and 24% for the respective periods of 2021. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the effect of income subject to preferential tax rates mainly attributed to the gain from the sale of Evertec shares and to and higher tax exempt income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2022, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset amounting to $0.9 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.6 billion. The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. operations was $0.2 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion. 

&#160; 

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (&#8220;AMT&#8221;), effective for taxable year 2023, to corporations that meet a dual three-year average adjusted financial statement income (&#8220;AFSI&#8221;) threshold of $1 billion on a worldwide basis and $100 million for its U.S. operations. The AFSI is, in general, the GAAP net income per financial statements with certain adjustments, including foreign taxes and tax depreciation. The Corporation is still evaluating the application of these adjustments that could be decisive in whether Popular is subject to the corporate AMT. If it is determined that the Corporation is subject to the corporate AMT, it is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Corporation. 

&#160; 

Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on the income tax expense and deferred tax asset balances. 

&#160; 

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments for managerial reporting purposes consist of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. A Corporate grou p has been defined to support the reportable segments. 

&#160; 

For a description of the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments, including additional financial information and the underlying management accounting process, refer to Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Corporate group reported a net income of $132.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared with a net income of $7.0 million for the same quarter of the previous year . The increase in net income was mainly attributed to the $128.8 million in after-tax gains recognized by the Corporation as a result of the Evertec Stock Sale and related accounting adjustments . For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 the Corporate group reported net income of $143.4 million, compared to a net income of $15.9 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net income was due to impact of the Evertec Stock Sale and related accounting adjustments; lower interest expense from the redemption in the fourth quarter of 2021 of $186.7 million in Trust Preferred Securities issued by Popular Capital Trust I; and higher earnings from equity method investments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable segments are discussed below: 

&#160; 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 

&#160;

The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher net interest income by $69.0 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest income from money market and investment securities by $76.3 million largely due to higher average balances of U.S. Treasury securities and higher yields from balances maintained at the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest income from loans by $22.5 million mainly from consumer loans due to higher average balance of personal loans and credit cards higher yields; and higher average balance in commercial loans, construction and leases. 

&#160; 

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest expense on deposits by $29.5 million mainly from Puerto Rico government deposits, NOW accounts and time deposits, due to the increase in interest rates. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 was 3.27% compared to 2.75% for the same quarter in the previous year. The increase in net interest margin is driven by earnings assets mix and the higher rates for money market investments held at the Federal Reserve.

&#160; 

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower professional fees by $7.9 million due mainly to lower programming, technology services, IT consulting and merchant processing fees reflecting savings as result of Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower income tax expense by $17.1 million mainly due to higher exempt income and the income from the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction which was subject to a preferential tax rate.

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest expense on deposits by $28.1 million mainly due to higher costs on Puerto Rico government, NOW accounts and time deposits. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 2.99% compared to 2.91% for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net interest margin is driven by earnings assets mix. 

&#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $64.8 billion at September 30, 2022, compared to $67.0 billion at December 31, 2021.

At September 30, 2022, Puerto Rico public sector deposits amounted to $17.5 billion. These include $1.4 billion transferred out of BPPR at the beginning of October and exclude $727 million in deposits managed by the Corporation&#8217;s Fiduciary Services Division, where it acts as custodian or escrow agent. The receipt by the Puerto Rico Government of additional COVID-19 pandemic and hurricane recovery related Federal assistance, and seasonal tax collections, could increase public deposit balances at BPPR in the near term. However, the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the speed at which COVID-19 pandemic and hurricane recovery federal assistance is distributed, the financial condition, liquidity and cash management practices of the Puerto Rico Government and its instrumentalities and the implementation of fiscal and debt adjustment plans approved pursuant to PROMESA or other actions mandated by the Fiscal Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Approximately 27% of the Corporation&#8217;s deposits are public fund deposits from the Government of Puerto Rico, Municipalities and government instrumentalities and corporations. These deposits are indexed to short term market rates and fluctuate in cost with changes in those rates with a one-quarter lag, in accordance with contractual terms. As a result, these deposits&#8217; costs have generally lagged variable asset repricing. Based on projected interest rate expectations and deposit volumes, we expect this condition to result in an increase in deposit costs in the fourth quarter of 2022 by approximately 150 basis points from current levels.

REGULATORY CAPITAL 

&#160; 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB are subject to regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. The risk-based capital standards applicable to the Corporation, BPPR and PB (&#8220;Basel III capital rules&#8221;) are based on the final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of September 30, 2022, t he Corporation&#8217;s, BPPR&#8217;s and PB&#8217;s capital ratios continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules.

[1] The CECL transitional amount includes the impact of Popular's adoption of the new CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020. 

&#160; 

The Basel III capital rules provide that a depository institution will be deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based ratio of at least 10%. Management has determined that as of September 30, 2022, the Corporation, BPPR and PB continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation elected to use the five-year transition period option as provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective March 31, 2020. The five-year transition period provision delays for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. As of September 30, 2022, the Corporation had phased-in 25% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remainder of the three-year transition period. 

&#160; 

On April 9, 2020, federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule to modify the Basel III regulatory capital rules applicable to banking organizations to allow those organizations participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the program. Specifically, the agencies have clarified that banking organizations, including the Corporation and its Bank subsidiaries, are permitted to assign a zero percent risk weight to PPP loans for purposes of determining risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, in order to facilitate use of the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the &#8220;PPPL Facility&#8221;), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation&#8217;s Bank subsidiaries to fund PPP loans, the agencies further clarified that, for purposes of determining leverage ratios, a banking organization is permitted to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a PPPL Facility. As of September 30, 2022, the Corporation has $47 million in PPP loans and no loans were pledge as collateral for PPPL Facilities. 

&#160; 

The decrease in the common equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio, and total capital ratio as of September 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was mainly attributed to the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase an aggregate of $400 million and $231 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock, and an increase in risk-weighted assets driven by the growth in the commercial loans portfolio, partially offset by the nine month period earnings. The increase in leverage capital ratio was mainly due to the decrease in average total assets, which mostly did not have a significant impact on the risk-weighted assets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-GAAP financial measures 

The tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share, which are presented in the table that follows, are non-GAAP measures. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method for mergers and acquisitions. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the Corporation&#8217;s capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets and/or liabilities. 

Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale amounted to $28.3 billion as of September 30, 2022. Other assets subject to market risk include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $8 million, mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $131 million and securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted to $30 million, as of September 30, 2022. 

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and option risks. In managing interest rate risk, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. 

Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII simulation modeling is prepared for a five-year period, which in conjunction with the EVE analysis, provides management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the Corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs. 

Management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various NII simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. For example, the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates, implied forwards, and parallel and non-parallel rate shocks. Management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures. 

The asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis. In addition, the model and processes used to assess IRR are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the Model Governance and Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude (parallel shifts). The rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of -100, -200, +100, +200 and +400 basis points during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses are based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes, interest rate spreads, loan prepayments and deposit elasticity. Thus, they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates. Additionally, the Company is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities, as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment. By their nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future. The following table presents the results of the simulations at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2022, NII simulations show the Corporation has a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the rapid increase in short-term interest rates throughout the year and its impact on Puerto Rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates, as well as the deployment of cash to fund loan growth and purchase investments. These results suggest that changes in net interest income are driven by changes in liability costs, primarily Puerto Rico public sector deposits. In declining rate scenarios net interest income would increase as the decline in the cost of these deposits generates a greater benefit than the changes in asset yields. In rising rate scenarios Popular&#8217;s sensitivity profile is also impacted by its large proportion of Puerto Rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates. As short-term rates have risen, the cost of these deposits now increases in sync with market rates and therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in rising rate environments. As of September 30, 2022, Popular has a more neutral position as compared to a substantially asset sensitive position as of December 31, 2021. The primary reasons for the reduction in sensitivity are i) the realization of much of the expected benefit in net interest income given the higher interest rates observed during the first nine months of 2022 ii) a decrease in cash balances (which reprice instantaneously) via the deployment into longer term investments and loans and iii) the market indexed nature of Puerto Rico public sector deposits which represented $17.5 billion or 27% of deposits as of September 30, 2022. 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a third-party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity. Prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten (or lower prepayments could extend) the weighted average life of these portfolios. 

Trading 

The Corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries, BPPR and Popular Securities. Popular Securities&#8217; trading activities consist primarily of market-making activities to meet expected customers&#8217; needs related to its retail brokerage business, and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected short-term price movements. BPPR&#8217;s trading activities consist primarily of holding U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221; and hedging the related market risk with &#8220;TBA&#8221; (to-be-announced) market transactions. The objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from short-term market movements. In addition, BPPR uses forward contracts or TBAs to hedge its securitization pipeline. Risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with TBAs that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline. 

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation held trading securities with a fair value of $30 million, representing approximately 0.04% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets. As shown in Table 11, the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries, which at September 30, 2022 were investment grade securities. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the trading portfolio also included $0.1 million in Puerto Rico government obligations. Trading instruments are recognized at fair value, with changes resulting from fluctuations in market prices, interest rates or exchange rates reported in current period earnings. The Corporation recognized net trading account losses of $274 thousand and a net trading account gain of $58 thousand, respectively, for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are limited by internal policies. For each of the two subsidiaries, the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5-day net value-at-risk (&#8220;VAR&#8221;), with a confidence level of 99%. The VAR measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. 

The Corporation&#8217;s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately $0.4 million for the last week in September 2022. There are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with VAR modeling, and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates. Backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses, in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy. 

In the opinion of management, the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the Corporation. 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations, finance expected future growth, fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the Corporation&#8217;s tolerance for liquidity risk, including approving relevant risk limits and policies. The Board of Directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the Board&#8217;s Risk Management Committee and the Asset/Liability Management Committee. The management of liquidity risk, on a long-term and day-to-day basis, is the responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Division. The Corporation&#8217;s Corporate Treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors and for monitoring the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis. Also, the Corporate Treasury Division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process. The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies. 

An institution&#8217;s liquidity may be pressured if, for example, it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, its credit rating is downgraded, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution. Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. 

Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. It is also managed at the level of the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. As further explained below, a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies (the &#8220;BHCs&#8221;) are dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The Corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries. Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur. However, such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event, and are dependent on many assumptions. 

&#160; 

Deposits, including customer deposits, brokered deposits and public funds deposits, continue to be the most significant source of funds for the Corporation, funding 92% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets at September 30, 2022 and 89% at December 31, 2021. The ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 49% at September 30, 2022, compared to 44% at December 31, 2021. In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.3 billion in outstanding balances at September 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $1.2 billion ). A detailed description of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings, including their terms, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the Corporation&#8217;s cash inflows and outflows. 

On July 12, 2022, the Corporation completed its previously announced accelerated share repurchase program for the repurchase of an aggregate $400 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation entered into a $231 million ASR and received an initial delivery of 2,339,241 shares of common stock. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

The following sections provide further information on the Corporation&#8217;s major funding activities and needs, as well as the risks involved in these activities. 

Banking Subsidiaries 

Primary sources of funding for the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries (BPPR and PB or, collectively, &#8220;the banking subsidiaries&#8221;) include retail, commercial and public sector deposits, brokered deposits, unpledged investment securities, mortgage loan securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 

Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries. 

The principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations, investment portfolio purchases, loan purchases and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses. Also, the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments, recourse provisions, servicing advances, derivatives, credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by BPPR. 

The banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows. The Corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various factors, including pricing, service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results, credit ratings (by nationally recognized credit rating agencies), and importantly, FDIC deposit insurance. Although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits, management does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings. 

Deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates. Refer to Table 7 for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit under $250,000, excluding brokered deposits with denominations under $250,000. Core deposits have historically provided the Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled $61.1 billion, or 94% of total deposits, at September 30, 2022 , compared with $63.6 billion, or 95% of total deposits, at December 31, 2021 . Core deposits financed 93% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at September 30, 2022, compared with 88% at December 31, 2021 . 

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of $250,000 and over at September 30, 2022 is presented in the table that follows:

The Corporation had $0.9 billion in brokered deposits at September 30, 2022 , which financed approximately 1% of its total assets (December 31, 2021 - $0.8 billion and 1%, respectively) . In the event that any of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a well-capitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators, that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits, which may hinder the Corporation&#8217;s ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts. 

Deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the Corporation. As of September 30, 2022, total public sector deposits were $17.5 billion, compared to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2021. These include $1.4 billion transferred out of BPPR at the beginning of October 2022 and exclude $727 million in deposits managed by the Corporation&#8217;s Fiduciary Services Division, where it acts as custodian or escrow agent. Generally, these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return. This, now unpledged, collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash. However, there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral. Additionally, the Corporation mainly utilizes fixed-rate U.S. Treasury Debt Securities as collateral. While these securities have limited credit risk, they are subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment. When interest rates increase, the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the Corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the same amount of deposit liabilities. This additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as liquidity sources to the Corporation. 

At September 30, 2022 , management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity. Finally, if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

Bank Holding Companies 

The principal sources of funding for the BHCs, which are Popular, Inc. (holding company only) and PNA, include cash on hand, investment securities, dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales, credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the BHCs. 

The principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt, and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest (related to trust preferred securities), the payment of dividends to common stockholders, repurchases of the Corporation&#8217;s securities and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

The outstanding balance of notes payable at the BHCs amounted to $497 million at September 30, 2022 and $496 million at December 31, 2021 . 

The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable at September 30, 2022 are presented in Table 13.

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s 6.125% unsecured senior debt securities mature in the September of 2023. Annual debt service at the BHCs is approximately $32 million, and the Corporation&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.55 per share or approximately $40 million per quarter. The BHCs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all BHCs debt service and dividend obligations during the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2022, the BHCs had cash and money markets investments totaling $222 million and borrowing potential of $193 million from its secured facility with BPPR. 

The BHCs have in the past borrowed in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance debt obligations. These sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the Corporation below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which affects the Corporation&#8217;s cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets. Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook, interest rate volatility, inflation, disruptions in the debt market, among others, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. The Corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

On July 1, 2022, the Corporation exchanged a portion of Evertec shares as part of a transaction in which it acquired certain critical channels from Evertec and renegotiated several service agreements. The Corporation completed the sale of its remaining shares of Evertec on August 15, 2022. Following the Evertec Stock Sale, Popular no longer owns any Evertec common stock. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The principal sources of funding for the non-banking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations, loan sales, repurchase agreements, capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies. The principal uses of funds for the non-banking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, operational expenses and payment of dividends to the BHCs. The liquidity needs of the non-banking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies. During the period ended September 30, 2022, Popular, Inc. made capital contributions to its wholly owned subsidiaries of $25 million to Popular Re, Inc., $10 million to Popular Securities and $3 million to Popular Impact Fund. 

Dividends 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Corporation declared cash dividends of $1.65 per common share outstanding ($124.2 million in the aggregate). The dividends for the Corporation&#8217;s Series A preferred stock amounted to $1.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the BHC&#8217;s received dividends amounting to $450 million from BPPR, $54 million from PNA, $4 million in dividends from its non-banking subsidiaries and $2 million in dividends from Evertec. In addition, during the nine months ended June 30, 2022, Popular International Bank Inc., wholly owned subsidiary of Popular, Inc., received $16 million in dividends from its investment in BHD. Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc.&#8217;s primary source of liquidity. 

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

The debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity, which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements. The Corporation&#8217;s debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets. The availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s 

&#160; 

unpledged debt securities amounted to $10.2 billion at September 30, 2022 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2021. A substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the U.S. money markets or from secured lending sources. 

Additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities, prepayments and sales. The loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets. In particular, mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have secondary markets which the Corporation could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments 

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Corporation&#8217;s commitments to extent credit and other non-credit commitments. 

Other types of off-balance sheet arrangements that the Corporation enters in the ordinary course of business include derivatives, operating leases and provision of guarantees, indemnifications, and representation and warranties. Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on operating leases and to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion related to the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under credit recourse and representation and warranties arrangements. 

The Corporation monitors its cash requirements, including its contractual obligations and debt commitments. As discussed above, liquidity is managed by the Corporation in order to meet its short- and long-term cash obligations. Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements has information on the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings by maturity, which amounted to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $1.2 billion). 

Financial information of guarantor and issuers of registered guaranteed securities 

The Corporation (not including any of its subsidiaries, &#8220;PIHC&#8221;) is the parent holding company of Popular North America &#8220;PNA&#8221; and has other subsidiaries through which it conducts its financial services operations. PNA is an operating, 100% subsidiary of Popular, Inc. Holding Company (&#8220;PIHC&#8221;) and is the holding company of its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Equity One, Inc. and PB, including PB&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries Popular Equipment Finance, LLC, Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A., and E-LOAN, Inc. 

PNA has issued junior subordinated debentures guaranteed by PIHC (together with PNA, the &#8220;obligor group&#8221;) purchased by statutory trusts established by the Corporation. These debentures were purchased by the statutory trust using the proceeds from trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as &#8220;capital securities&#8221;), together with the proceeds of the related issuances of common securities of the trusts. 

PIHC fully and unconditionally guarantees the junior subordinated debentures issued by PNA. PIHC&#8217;s obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts to the holders of the applicable capital securities or by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions by the applicable trust except to the extent such trust has funds available for such payments. If PIHC does not make interest payments on the debentures held by such trust, such trust will not pay distributions on the applicable capital securities and will not have funds available for such payments. PIHC&#8217;s guarantee of PNA&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures is unsecured and ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the PIHC&#8217;s other liabilities in the same manner as the applicable debentures as set forth in the applicable indentures&#894; and equally with all other guarantees that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection, which means that the guaranteed party may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the respective guarantee without suing any other person or entity. 

The principal sources of funding for PIHC and PNA have included dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. As further described below, in the Risk to Liquidity section, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. 

&#160; 

The following summarized financial information presents the financial position of the obligor group, on a combined basis at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of their operations for the period ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Investments in and equity in the earnings from the other subsidiaries and affiliates that are not members of the obligor group have been excluded. 

The summarized financial information of the obligor group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. The obligor group's amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates have been presented in separate line items, if they are material. In addition, related parties transactions are presented separately.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Obligor group recorded $1.5 million of dividend distributions from its direct equity method investees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Obligor group recorded $2.2 million of distributions from its direct equity method investees, of which $1.7 million were related to dividend distributions. 

&#160; 

Risks to Liquidity 

Total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis. Some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements, among other factors. Derivatives, such as those embedded in long-term repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps, and off-balance sheet exposures, such as recourse, performance bonds or credit card arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements. As their fair value increases, the collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of the Puerto Rico market for the Corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities. In the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico, the credit quality of the Corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs. Refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of this MD&#38;A for some highlights on the current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. In order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario, management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable. These plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms, such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the FHLB and the FRB. The Corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the FHLB that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms, even if the Corporation exceeds well-capitalized regulatory capital levels. 

The credit ratings of Popular&#8217;s debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the Corporation&#8217;s ability to borrow in the capital markets, its cost and access to funding sources. Credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management, geographic concentration in Puerto Rico, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources, among other factors. 

Furthermore, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, after considering those years&#8217; dividend activity, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, BPPR declared cash dividends of $450 million. At September 30, 2022, BPPR would have needed to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before declaring a dividend due to its declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the latest three years. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. The ability of a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to its BHC could thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital, including tangible and regulatory capital, thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the BHCs from the banking subsidiaries. This could, in turn, affect the BHCs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock, repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations, for example. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had $9 million in deposits at September 30, 2022 that are subject to rating triggers. 

&#160; 

In addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution&#8217;s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $31 million at September 30, 2022. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. 

&#160; 

Credit Risk 

&#160; 

Geographic and Government Risk 

&#160; 

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. The Corporation&#8217;s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Commonwealth&#8221; or &#8220;Puerto Rico&#8221;), which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges. 

Hurricane Fiona 

On September 18, 2022, Hurricane Fiona made landfall in the southwest area of Puerto Rico as a Category 1 hurricane, bringing record rainfall and flooding throughout the island and affecting communities where BPPR does business. The hurricane caused a complete blackout on the island and considerable damage to certain sectors in the southwest region. While the impact to BPPR&#8217;s operations was not material, customers in certain municipalities of the island were impacted by the disaster. 

As part of hurricane relief efforts, the Corporation waived late-payment fees on individual lending products from September 16 through October 31, 2022. The Corporation also offered to clients impacted by the hurricane a moratorium of up to three monthly payments, until December 31, 2022, on personal and commercial credit cards, auto loans, leases and personal loans, subject to certain eligibility requirements. Various payment relief alternatives were also made available to certain mortgage customers, depending on their type of loan. 

The Corporation is still evaluating the impact of Hurricane Fiona. However, given the low level of assistance requests received by the Corporation to date, the effect on credit risk should not be significant. 

Economic Performance 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) contracted (in real terms) every fiscal year between 2007 and 2018, with the exception of fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the &#8220;Planning Board&#8221;) estimates, dated March 2021, the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP increased by 1.8% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Mar&#237;a. However, the Planning Board estimates that the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP decreased by approximately 3.2% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. The Planning Board projected that the negative effects of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2%, followed by 0.8% and 1.7% GNP growth in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively. 

Certain information regarding current economic activity is available in the form of the Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico (&#8220;EDB&#8221;) Economic Activity Index (the &#8220;EDB Economic Activity Index&#8221;), a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a 

&#160; 

direct measurement of real GNP. The latest EDB Economic Activity Index reflected a 1.5 % increase in August 2022, compared to August 2021. From January to August 2022, the EDB Economic Activity Index reflected a 3.0% increase compared to the same period in calendar year 2021. 

The Puerto Rico Consumer Price Index, published by the Department of Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico, was recorded at 130.4 in September 2022, representing a 6.1% increase when compared to September 2021 and effectively flat versus August 2022. The United States Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, increased by 8.2% from September 2022 and by 0.4% from August 2022. Increasing inflation or prolonged periods of high inflation may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Fiscal Challenges 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s central government and many of its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities continue to face significant fiscal challenges, which have been primarily the result of economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy obligations, and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. The escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in June 2016. As further discussed below under &#8220;Pending Title III Proceedings,&#8221; the Commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities recently emerged from a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA. 

PROMESA 

PROMESA, among other things, created a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;) with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the Commonwealth, its public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities and established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of such entities. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets, in accordance with modified accrual accounting, are produced for at least four consecutive years. 

In October 2016, the Oversight Board designated the Commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities (except its municipalities) as &#8220;covered entities&#8221; under PROMESA. In May 2019, the Oversight Board also designated all of the Commonwealth&#8217;s municipalities as covered entities. At the Oversight Board&#8217;s request, covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the Oversight Board for its review and approval. They are also required to seek Oversight Board approval to issue, guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of $10 million or more. Finally, covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. For additional discussion of risk factors related to the Puerto Rico fiscal challenges, see &#8220;Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; in the Corporation&#8217;s Form 10-K. 

Fiscal Plans 

Commonwealth Fiscal Plan . The Oversight Board has certified several fiscal plans for the Commonwealth since 2017. The most recent fiscal plan for the Commonwealth certified by the Oversight Board is dated January 27, 2022 (the &#8220;2022 Fiscal Plan&#8221;). Pursuant to the 2022 Fiscal Plan, while the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the same severely reduced economic activity and caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment in Puerto Rico, pandemic-related federal and local stimulus funding have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis. The 2022 Fiscal Plan&#8217;s economic projections incorporate adjustments for these short-term income effects. For example, the 2022 Fiscal Plan estimates that, for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, real GNP will grow 2.6% and 0.9%, respectively, but projects that growth adjusted for income effects for such years will be approximately 5.2% and 0.6%, respectively. 

The 2022 Fiscal Plan incorporates the debt service costs of the Commonwealth&#8217;s restructured debt pursuant to the Plan of Adjustment (as defined and further explained below), and projects an unrestricted surplus after debt service averaging $1 billion annually between fiscal years 2022 to 2031. This surplus is projected to decline over time as federal disaster relief funding slows, nominal GNP growth declines, revenues decline, and healthcare expenditures rise. The 2022 Fiscal Plan estimates that fiscal measures could drive approximately $6.3 billion in savings and extra revenue over fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and that structural reforms could drive a cumulative 0.90% increase in growth by fiscal year 2051 (equal to approximately $33 billion). 

&#160; 

The 2022 Fiscal Plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination, by fiscal year 2025, of Commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of some municipalities. According to the 2022 Fiscal Plan, municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing the fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on Commonwealth appropriations and this lack of fiscal management may threaten the ability of certain municipalities to provide necessary services, such as health, sanitation, public safety, and emergency services to their residents, forcing them to prioritize expenditures. 

Other Fiscal Plans. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities. The certified fiscal plan for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (&#8220;PREPA&#8221;), Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric power utility, contemplated the transformation of Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric system through, among other things, the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to PREPA&#8217;s transmission and distribution system (the &#8220;T&#38;D System&#8221;), and calls for significant structural reforms at PREPA. The procurement process for the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to the T&#38;D System was completed in June 2020. The selected proponent, LUMA Energy LLC (&#8220;LUMA&#8221;), and PREPA entered into a 15-year agreement whereby, since June 1, 2021, LUMA is responsible for operating, maintaining and modernizing the T&#38;D System (the &#8220;T&#38;D Agreement&#8221;). The commencement of such 15-year term, however, was conditioned on PREPA&#8217;s emergence from its debt restructuring process under Title III of PROMESA (the &#8220;Title III Exit&#8221;), which has not occurred. During this interim period, LUMA has been operating the T&#38;D System pursuant to a supplemental terms agreement (the &#8220;Supplemental Agreement&#8221;), which expires on November 30, 2022, unless the Title III Exit condition is waived, or the term of the Supplemental Agreement is extended by the parties. Such termination would trigger the commencement of a transition period during which LUMA would transfer the operations of the T&#38;D System to PREPA or a third-party successor operator. 

On May 20, 2022, the Oversight Board certified the latest version of the fiscal plan (the &#8220;CRIM Fiscal Plan&#8221;) for the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (&#8220;CRIM&#8221;), the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities. The CRIM Fiscal Plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of Puerto Rico&#8217;s property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections, including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties, and implementing operational and technological initiatives. 

Title III Proceedings 

On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board, on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court to restructure the Commonwealth&#8217;s liabilities under Title III of PROMESA. The Oversight Board subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (&#8220;COFINA&#8221;), the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (&#8220;ERS&#8221;), the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (&#8220;HTA&#8221;), PREPA and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (&#8220;PBA&#8221;). On February 12, 2019, the government completed a restructuring of COFINA&#8217;s debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the U.S. District Court. 

On November 3, 2021, the Oversight Board filed the Eighth Amended Title III Joint Plan of Adjustment for the Commonwealth, ERS and PBA (the &#8220;Commonwealth Plan of Adjustment&#8221;). On March 15, 2022, the Plan of Adjustment became effective. The Commonwealth Plan of Adjustment reduced the Commonwealth&#8217;s debt obligations from approximately $34.3 billion of prepetition debt to approximately $7.4 billion in new general obligation bonds and approximately $8.7 billion in new contingent value instruments. This also resulted in a reduction of the Commonwealth&#8217;s maximum annual debt service by approximately 73%. 

On October 12, 2022, the U.S. District Court confirmed the Modified Fifth Amended Title III Plan of Adjustment for HTA, which is expected to become effective this year upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to its effectiveness. PREPA&#8217;s debt restructuring process under Title III of PROMESA is still ongoing. 

Exposure of the Corporation 

The credit quality of BPPR&#8217;s loan portfolio reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. While PROMESA provided a process to address the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal challenges, the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans still present significant economic risks. Furthermore, if global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board are unable to adequately manage the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges, these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government&#8217;s instrumentalities and municipalities totaled $365 million of which $322 million were outstanding, compared to $367 million at December 31, 2021, of which $349 million were outstanding. A deterioration in the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us. Of the amount outstanding, $297 million consists of loans and $25 million are securities ($319 million and $30 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021). All of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure outstanding at September 30, 2022 were obligations from various Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases, these were &#8220;general obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or &#8220;special obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At September 30, 2022, 74% of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam&#243;n. For additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to Note 21 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies. 

In addition, at September 30, 2022, the Corporation had $256 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities, but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental ($275 million at December 31, 2021). These included $214 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December 31, 2021 - $232 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Corporation also had, at September 30, 2022, $42 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions (December 31, 2021 - $43 million). In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. The Corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, a moratorium on such obligations has not been imposed as of the date hereof. 

BPPR&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal and economic measures taken by the Commonwealth government. Similarly, BPPR&#8217;s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees, which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits. 

As of September 30, 2022, BPPR had $17.5 billion in deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the speed at which COVID-19 pandemic and hurricane recovery federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition, liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. 

The Corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the Oversight Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

United States Virgin Islands 

The Corporation has operations in the United States Virgin Islands (the &#8220;USVI&#8221;) and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. 

The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges, which have been and might be further exacerbated as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. 

To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2022, the Corporation had approximately $29 million in direct exposure to USVI government entities (December 31, 2021 - $70 million). The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. 

British Virgin Islands 

The Corporation has operations in the British Virgin Islands (&#8220;BVI&#8221;), which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy. Although the Corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the BVI, at September 30, 2022 it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately $216 million comprised of various retail and commercial clients, compared to a loan portfolio of $221 million at December 31, 2021. 

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities represented exposure to the U.S. Government in the form of U.S. Government sponsored entities, as well as agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.5 billion of residential mortgages, $47 million of SBA loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and $71 million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies at September 30, 2022 (compared to $1.6 billion, $353 million and $67 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021). 

&#160; 

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) include primarily past-due loans that are no longer accruing interest, renegotiated loans, and real estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented in Table 16. 

During the third quarter of 2022, the Corporation showed stable credit quality trends with low levels of NCOs and decreasing NPLs. We continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance, given inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. However, management continues to believe that the improvement over recent years in the risk profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios positions Popular to operate successfully under the current environment. The impact of Hurricanes Fiona and Ian is still being evaluated but given Fiona&#8217;s limited impact in the markets that Popular does business and low levels of assistance requests received to date, the effect on credit risk should not be significant. 

&#160; 

Total NPAs decreased by $86 million at September 30, 2022 when compared with December 31, 2021. Total non-performing loans held-in-portfolio (&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) decreased by $95 million at September 30, 2022 from December 31, 2021. BPPR&#8217;s NPLs decreased by $104 million at September 30, 2022, mainly driven by lower mortgage NPLs by $81 million, due to the combined effects of collection efforts, increased foreclosure activity and the on-going low levels of early delinquency compared with pre-pandemic trends, coupled with a $33 million decrease in the commercial NPLs. Popular U.S. NPLs increased by $10 million at September 30, 2022 solely due to an $11 million commercial borrower within the healthcare industry that was placed in non-accrual status during the quarter due to financial distress. At September 30, 2022, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.4% compared to 1.9% in December 31, 2021. Other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) increased by $8 million at September 30, 2022, mainly due to the end of the COVID-19 related foreclosure moratorium period. 

At September 30, 2022, NPLs secured by real estate amounted to $317 million in the Puerto Rico operations and $38 million in Popular U.S. These figures were $428 million and $31 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 

The Corporation&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) amounted to $9.8 billion at September 30, 2022, of which $3.1 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, compared with $8.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the Corporation reclassified $0.9 billion of loans from the Commercial Real Estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) Non-Owner-Occupied category to the CRE Owner-Occupied category. The selected loans are primarily to skilled and assisted living nursing homes where the majority of the revenues, which are the basis for the repayment of the loans, are generated from medical and related operational activities. These loans meet the type of business and source requirements as defined in the regulatory guidance allowing this classification. CRE NPLs amounted to $61 million at September 30, 2022, compared with $77 million at December 31, 2021. The CRE NPL ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments were 1.06% and 0.22%, respectively, at September 30, 2022, compared with 1.95% and 0.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 

&#160; 

In addition to the NPLs included in Table 16, at September 30, 2022, there were $376 million of performing loans, mainly commercial loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, were currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2021 - $214 million). 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, total inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio, excluding consumer loans, increased by approximately $3 million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2021. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment decreased by $11 million compared to the same period in 2021, mostly driven by lower mortgage inflows by $9 million, in part offset by lower commercial inflows by $2 million. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. increased by $14 million when compared to the same period in 2021, driven by the abovementioned commercial healthcare NPL.

[1] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

[2] It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. The balance of these loans includes $9 million at September 30, 2022, related to the rebooking of loans previously pooled into GNMA securities, in which the Corporation had a buy-back option as further described below (December 31, 2021 - $13 million). Under the GNMA program, issuers such as BPPR have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to repurchases option are required to be reflected (rebooked) on the financial statements of BPPR with an offsetting liability. These balances include $198 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of September 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $304 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $42 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31, 2021 - $50 million).

[1] Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.5 billion of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as of September 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $0.6 billion). Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of guaranteed loans. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation, management considers current conditions, macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period, historical loss experience, portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics, results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans, and regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

&#160; 

The Corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. Other factors that can affect management&#8217;s estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold, may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses. Consequently, the business financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could also be affected. 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $703 million, an increase of $8 million, when compared with December 31, 2021. The ACL incorporated updated macroeconomic scenarios for Puerto Rico and the United States. Given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple scenarios to estimate its ACL. The baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario. The Corporation evaluates, at least on an annual basis, the assumptions tied to the CECL accounting framework. These include the reasonable and supportable period as well as the reversion window. This quarter, as part of its evaluation procedures, the Corporation decided to extend the reversion window from 1 year to 3 years. The extension in the reversion period results in a better representation of historical movements for key macroeconomic variables that impact the ACL. This change in assumptions contributed to a reduction of $11 million in the ACL. The reasonable and supportable period assumptions remained unchanged. 

&#160; 

The baseline scenario assumes an annualized 2022 GDP growth of 3.1% and 1.6% for Puerto Rico and United States, respectively, compared to 2.8% for both regions in the previous quarter. The improvement in P.R.&#8217;s GDP was mainly due to updated fiscal assumptions, which include the potential impact of the Inflation Reduction Act. As for the U.S., the reduction in GDP growth was 

&#160; 

driven by updated data for the second quarter of 2022, which reflected two consecutive quarters of GDP decline. 2023 annualized GDP growth for P.R. and U.S. is of 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to 2.7% for both regions in the previous quarter. The reduction in 2023 is in part due to tight monetary policy, weaker job growth and persistent inflation. The 2022 average unemployment rate remained largely consistent QoQ forecasted at 6.6% and 3.6% for Puerto Rico and United States, respectively, compared to 6.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in the previous forecast. For 2023 the forecasted average unemployment rate for P.R. and U.S. is 7.8% and 3.9%, slightly higher than previous quarter&#8217;s 7.6% and 3.4% for P.R. and U.S., respectively. 

&#160; 

The ACL for BPPR was essentially flat, decreasing by $3 million to $591 million at September 30, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021. The ACL for Popular U.S. increased by $11 million at September 30, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by an $8 million reserve recorded for the abovementioned commercial healthcare NPL. 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, amounted to $39.5 million, compared to a net benefit of $58.6 million in the same period in the prior year . The third quarter of 2021 included reductions in reserves due to improvements in the macroeconomic scenarios. Refer to Note 9 &#8211; Allowance for credit losses &#8211; loans held-in-portfolio, and to the Provision for Credit Losses section of this MD&#38;A for additional information.

NCOs for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 amounted to $18.2 million, an unfavorable variance by $9.4 million when compared to the same period in 2021. The BPPR segment increased by $9.1 million mainly driven by higher consumer NCOs by $11.4 million. The consumer NCOs increase was mainly related to post-pandemic normalization, as NCOs continue at historical low levels. The PB segment NCOs remained essentially flat. The low level of NCOs was due to the effect of a favorable economic environment and continued borrower performance, as reflected in the ongoing low level of delinquencies and NPLs when compared to pre-pandemic trends. 

&#160; 

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A total of $725 million of these TDRs are related to guaranteed loans, which are in accruing status. TDRs in the BPPR segment amounted to $1.6 billion, a decrease of $16 million, mainly related to decreases of $11 million and $3 million in the consumer and mortgage TDRs, respectively. The Popular U.S. segment TDRs remained flat at $14 million from December 31, 2021. TDRs in accruing status increased by $20 million from December 31, 2021, while non-accruing TDRs decreased by $35 million, mostly related to mortgage TDRs.
