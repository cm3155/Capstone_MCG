 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This report includes management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of the consolidated financial position and financial performance of Popular, Inc. (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221; or &#8220;Popular&#8221;). All accompanying tables, financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report should be considered an integral part of this analysis. 

&#160; 

The Corporation is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) mainland and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#8220;BPPR&#8221;), as well as investment banking, broker-dealer, auto and equipment leasing and financing, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. In the U.S. mainland, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage, equipment leasing and financing, and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (&#8220;PB&#8221;), which has branches located in New York, New Jersey and Florida and its subsidiaries . Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents information about the Corporation&#8217;s business segments. 

&#160; 

The Corporation has several investments which it accounts for under the equity method. As of June 30, 2022, the Corporation had a 16.33 % interest in Evertec, Inc. (&#8220;Evertec&#8221;), whose operating subsidiaries provide transaction processing services throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, and service many of the Corporation&#8217;s systems infrastructure and transaction processing businesses. On July 1, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s ownership stake in Evertec was reduced to 10.6%, as further discussed below. During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded $ 6.9 million in earnings from its investment in Evertec, which had a carrying amount of $125 million as of the end of the quarter. 

&#160; 

Also, the Corporation had a 15.84% equity interest in Centro Financiero BHD Le&#243;n, S.A. (&#8220;BHD Le&#243;n&#8221;), one of the largest banking and financial services groups in the Dominican Republic. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded $14.5 million in earnings from its investment in BHD Le&#243;n, which had a carrying amount of $184.8 million, as of the end of the quarter. 

&#160; 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Key Customer Channels and Amendments to Commercial Contracts with Evertec 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#8220;BPPR&#8221;), completed its previously announced acquisition of certain assets from Evertec Group, LLC (&#8220;Evertec Group&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Evertec, Inc. (&#8220;Evertec&#8221;) (NYSE: EVTC), to service certain BPPR channels. 

As a result of the closing of the transaction, BPPR acquired from Evertec Group certain critical channels, including BPPR&#8217;s retail and business digital banking and commercial cash management applications. BPPR also entered into amended and restated service agreements with Evertec Group pursuant to which Evertec Group will continue to provide various information technology and transaction processing services to Popular, BPPR and their respective subsidiaries. 

Under the amended service agreements, Popular will have greater optionality to develop and enhance technology platforms and more flexibility to select service vendors, as Evertec Group no longer has exclusive rights to provide certain of Popular&#8217;s technology services. This is expected to improve Popular&#8217;s ability to meet its customer needs in a timely manner. In addition, the amended service agreements are projected to reduce service costs as a result of discounted pricing and lowered caps on contractual pricing escalators tied to the Consumer Price Index. As part of the transaction, BPPR also strengthened its relationship with Evertec in the payments business, including through the incorporation of a revenue sharing structure for BPPR in connection with its merchant acquiring relationship with Evertec. 

As consideration for the transaction, BPPR delivered to Evertec Group 4,589,169 shares of Evertec common stock valued at closing at $169 million (based on Evertec&#8217;s stock price on June 30, 2022 of $36.88), resulting in an after-tax gain of approximately $112 million. 

&#160; 

In terms of capital, the transaction results in a negative impact of approximately $44 million in Popular&#8217;s tangible book value as a result of the net effect of the after-tax gain of the Evertec shares used as consideration for the transaction (approximately $112 million), minus approximately $145 million in goodwill and other intangible assets recognized by the Corporation in connection with the transaction and the accounting impact of the renegotiation of the Master Servicing Agreement with Evertec. 

As a result of the transfer of the shares used as consideration for the transaction, Popular&#8217;s ownership stake in Evertec was reduced from approximately 16.3% to approximately 10.6% at the closing of the transaction. In connection with the transaction, Popular has agreed to further reduce its voting interest in Evertec to no more than 4.5%, whether through selling shares of Evertec common stock or a conversion of such shares into non-voting preferred stock within 90 days of the closing of the transaction. Popular expects to sell down its stake in Evertec to no more than 4.5%, subject to market conditions, and intends to return to Popular shareholders, via common stock repurchases, any after-tax gains resulting from such sale, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. 

Completion of Accelerated Share Repurchase 

&#160; 

On July 12, 2022, the Corporation completed its previously announced accelerated share repurchase program for the repurchase of an aggregate $400 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock. Under the terms of the accelerated share repurchase agreement (the &#8220;ASR Agreement&#8221;), on March 2, 2022 the Corporation made an initial payment of $400 million and received an initial delivery of 3,483,942 shares of Popular&#8217;s Common Stock (the &#8220;Initial Shares&#8221;). The transaction was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction. As a result of the receipt of the Initial Shares, the Corporation recognized in stockholders&#8217; equity approximately $320 million in treasury stock and $80 million as a reduction in capital surplus. Upon the final settlement of the ASR Agreement, the Corporation received an additional 1,582,922 shares of Popular common stock and recognized approximately $120 million as treasury stock with a corresponding increase in its capital surplus account. The Corporation repurchased a total of 5,066,864 shares at an average purchase price of $78.9443 under the ASR Agreement. Refer to Note 17 &#8211; Stockholders&#8217; Equity for further information on the ASR transaction. 

OVERVIEW 

Table 1 provides selected financial data and performance indicators for the quarters and six months-periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. 

&#160; 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and sponsored entities, certain obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and/or its agencies and municipalities and assets held by the Corporation&#8217;s international banking entities. To facilitate the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense and other related expense disallowances required by Puerto Rico tax law. Thereunder, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is presented with its different components in Tables 2 and 3, along with the reconciliation to net interest income (GAAP), for the quarter and six month-period ended June 30, 2022 as compared with the same period in 2021, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

Financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 

&#61623; For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded net income of $ 211.4 million , compared to net income of $ 218.1 mi llion for the same quarter of the previous year. Net interest margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 3.09%, an increase of 18 basis points when compared to 2.91% for the same quarter of the previous year, mainly due to higher volume of loans, higher interest rate environment, and the change in mix of the money markets and investment portfolio. On a taxable equivalent basis, the net interest margin was of 3.45%, compared to 3.22% for the same quarter of the previous year. The Corporation recorded a provision for credit losses of $9.4 million, compared to a benefit of $17.0 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The higher provision for 2022 is attributed to the macroeconomic outlook and portfolio growth. Non-interest income was $157.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $2.9 million when compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2021 mainly due to higher credit card fees and mortgage banking activities. Operating expenses were higher by $38.1 million principally due to higher personnel costs and professional fees . 

&#61623; Total assets at June 30, 2022 amounted to $71.5 billion, compared to $75.1 billion, at December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to lower money market investments, due to a decrease in deposits, partially offset by higher debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity and loan growth. 

&#61623; Total deposits at June 30, 2022 decreased by $1.7 billion when compared to deposits at December 31, 2021, mainly due to lower Puerto Rico public sector deposits by $3.3 billion, partially offset by growth in other deposits sectors. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Total stockholders' equity decreased by $1.7 billion when compared to December 31, 2021, principally due to an increase in accumulated unrealized losses on debt securities available-for-sale by $1.6 billion due to a decline in fair value of fixed-rate debt securities as a result of the rising interest rate environment, the impact of the $400 million ASR and declared quarterly common stock dividends, partially offset by the net income of $423.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

&#61623; At June 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book value per common share was $46.18. 

&#61623; Capital ratios continued to be strong. As of June 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 16.39%, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.56%, and the total capital ratio was 18.29%. Refer to Table 8 for capital ratios.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 

&#160; 

The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and general practices within the financial services industry. Various elements of the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Corporation&#8217;s Audit Committee. The Corporation has identified as critical accounting policies those related to: (i) Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality; (iv) Income Taxes; (v) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets; and (vi) Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations. For a summary of these critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to that particular section in the MD&#38;A included in Popular, Inc.&#8217;s 2021 Form 10-K. Also, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2021 Form 10-K for a summary of the Corporation&#8217;s significant accounting policies and to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for information on recently adopted accounting standard updates.

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income for the second quarter of 2022 was $533.9 million, an increase of $46.1 million when compared to $487.8 million for the same quarter of 2021. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $595.5 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $541.2 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $54.3 million. 

Net interest margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 3.09%, an increase of 18 basis points when compared to 2.91% for the same quarter of the previous year. The increase in the net interest margin is mainly due to a higher volume of loans, a higher interest rate environment, and the change in mix of the money markets and investment portfolios. The net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the second quarter of 2022 was 3.45%, an increase of 23 basis points when compared to 3.22% for the same quarter of 2021. The detailed variances of the increase in net interest income are described below: 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Higher interest income from money market, investment, and trading securities by $38.2 million due to a higher volume by $1.2 billion and higher yield by 35 basis points related to a higher interest rate environment and the investment in longer term securities. The interest rate received on excess reserves at the Federal Reserve increased by 72 basis points when compared to the same quarter in 2021; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from commercial loans by $6.2 million due to a higher average volume by $688 million, partially offset by lower yield by eight basis points mainly driven by lower income from loans under the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) by $8.8 million; 

&#61623; The auto and lease financing portfolios interest income increased by $2.4 million due to higher average volume by $402.0 million, partially offset by lower yield due to a high volume of originations in a prolonged low interest rate environment. Also impacting the yield on this portfolio is a lower amortization of the portfolio purchased in 2018; and 

&#61623; Higher interest income from consumer loans by $6.2 million due to higher average volume by $223.0 million. 

Partially offset by: 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on medium and long-term debt due to the redemption, on the fourth quarter of 2021, of all outstanding 6.70% Cumulative Monthly Income Trust Preferred Securities ($186.7 million). 

Prepayment penalties, late fees collected and the amortization of premiums on purchased loans are included as part of the loan yield. Interest income related to these items for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $12.6 million and $31.1 million, respectively. The decrease of $18.5 million is mainly related to lower amortized fees resulting from the forgiveness of PPP loans of $4.7 million compared to $10.9 million in the second quarter of 2021, lower amortization recorded from the prepayment of previously purchased credit deteriorated loans and lower amortization on the fair value discount of the auto portfolios acquired in previous years.

Net interest income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 was $1.0 billion, or $61.3 million higher than the same period in 2021. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022, or $71.0 million higher than the same period in 2021. Net interest margin was 2.92%, a decrease of seven basis points when compared to 2.99% in 2021. The decrease in net interest margin is mainly driven by a higher volume of money market and investment securities, and a decrease in loan yields driven by lower PPP income when compared to the same period in 2021. Net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the six-months ended June 30, 2022, was 3.24%, a decrease of seven basis points when compared to the 3.31% for the same period of 2021. The drivers of the variances in net interest income for the six-month period are: 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Higher interest income from money market, investment, and trading securities by $53.6 million due to a higher volume by $5.3 billion mainly due to purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. This increase results from a higher volume of deposits of $6.0 billion as a result of Covid-19 U.S. Government stimulus and other aid. The yield of the portfolio increased seven basis points due to a higher volume of investment securities and higher interest rate received on excess reserves at the Federal Reserve by 35 basis points, driven by recent increases in the Federal Funds rate; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from the auto and lease financing portfolios due to the increase in volume of $418.3 million, partially offset by lower yield driven by a lower amortization of the discount of previously acquired portfolios and the origination of loans in a prolonged low interest rate environment; 

&#61623; Higher interest income from consumer loans mostly due to a higher average volume of personal loans and credit cards; 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on deposits due to lower cost by five basis points, partially offset by a higher volume of interest-bearing deposits by $3.9 billion; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on medium and long-term debt due to the redemption, on the fourth quarter of 2021, of all outstanding 6.70% Cumulative Monthly Income Trust Preferred Securities ($186.7 million); 

Negative variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest income from mortgage loans by $3.9 million driven by lower average volume mainly related to portfolio run-off. 

Prepayment penalties, late fees collected and the amortization of premiums on purchased loans are included as part of the loan yield. Interest income related to these items for the six-months ended June 30, 2022, amounted to $28.9 million, compared to $64.8 million in the same period of 2021. The decrease in loan fee income was driven by PPP loan fees, which amounted to $14.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 versus $30.9 million in the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 and lower amortization recorded from the prepayment of previously purchased credit deteriorated loans and lower amortization on the fair value discount of the auto portfolios acquired in previous years.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio and Unfunded Commitments 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded an expense of $9.7 million for its reserve for credit losses related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. The provision for credit loss related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 was $9.9 million, compared to a reserve release of $17.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The provision expense was mainly driven by higher loan volumes and changes in the macroeconomic scenarios. The reserve release related to unfunded commitments for the second quarter of 2022 was $0.2 million, compared to the provision for unfunded commitments of $0.4 million for the same period of 2021. 

&#160; 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded a provision for credit loss of $9.1 million for loans-held-in-portfolio for the BPPR segment, compared to a reserve release of $22.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The Popular U.S. segment recorded a provision of $.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared to a provision of $5.0 million for the same quarter in 2021. 

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded a release of $5.5 million for its reserve for credit losses related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. The reserve release related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 was $4.5 million, compared to the reserve release of $93.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021. The higher reserve release in 2021 reflected the improvements in the macroeconomic environment and outlook, at the time, and the related release of reserves accumulated during early stages of the covid pandemic. The provision for unfunded commitments for the six-month period of 2022 reflected a benefit of $1.0 million, compared to a provision benefit of $5.9 million for the same period of 2021. 

The provision for credit losses for the BPPR segment was a benefit of $3.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, compared to a benefit of $62.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021. The Popular U.S. segment recorded a reserve release of $1 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, compared to a benefit of $30.8 million for the same period in 2021. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2022 , the total allowance for credit losses for loans held-in-portfolio amounted to $681.8 million, compared to $695.4 million as of December 31, 2021. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.24% at June 30, 2022 , compared to 2.38% at December 31, 2021. As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, within the process to estimate its allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), the Corporation applies probability weightings to the outcomes of simulations using Moody&#8217;s Analytics&#8217; Baseline, S3 (pessimistic) and S1 (optimistic) scenarios. The baseline scenario is assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario given the uncertainties in the economic outlook and downside risk. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s methodology to estimate its allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;). Refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD&#38;A for a detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, the allowance for credit losses and selected loan losses statistics. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Provision for Credit Losses &#8211; Investment Securities 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s provision for credit losses related to its investment securities held-to-maturity is related to the portfolio of obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico, states and political subdivisions. For the quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2022 , the provision for credit losses was $0.3 million benefit and $0.6 million benefit, respectively, compared to a $0.1 million provision expense and a $0.1 million provision benefit, respectively, for the quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2021 . At June 30, 2022 , the total allowance for credit losses for this portfolio amounted to $7.5 million, compared to $8.1 million as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ACL for this portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-Interest Income 

&#160; 

Non-interest income amounted to $157.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared to $154.5 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The increase in non-interest income by $2.9 million was primarily driven by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other service fees by $5.1 million, principally at the BPPR segment, due to higher credit and debit card fees by $5.8 million mainly in interchange income resulting from higher transactional volumes; and 

&#61623; higher income from mortgage banking activities by $6.1 million mainly due to a positive variance of $8.5 million in the fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;); and higher realized gains on closed derivative positions by $3.3 million; partially offset by lower gain on sale of mortgage loans and securitization activity by $5.2 million; 

partially offset by: 

&#61623; an unfavorable variance in net (loss) gain on equity securities of $5.7 million mainly related to securities held for deferred benefit plans, which have an offsetting positive variance in personnel costs; and 

&#61623; lower other operating income by $3.0 million due to lower earnings from the portfolio of equity method investments. 

&#160; 

Non-interest income amounted to $312.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to $308.2 million for the same period of the previous year. Non-interest income increased by $3.9 million primarily driven by: 

&#61623; higher service charges on deposit accounts by $2.7 million principally due to higher ACH fees, offset by lower non-balance compensation fees at BPPR; and 

&#61623; higher other service fees by $11.6 million, principally at the BPPR segment, due to higher credit card fees mainly in interchange income resulting from higher volume of transactions; 

partially offset by 

&#61623; higher losses on equity securities by $8.2 million due mainly to securities held for deferred benefit plans, which have an offsetting positive variance in personnel costs; and 

&#61623; lower other operating income by $1.8 million principally due to lower net earnings from the combined portfolio of investments under the equity method and lower gains from the sale of long-lived assets. 

&#160; 

Operating Expenses 

&#160; 

Operating expenses amounted to $406.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $38.1 million when compared with the same quarter of 2021, driven primarily by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher personnel cost by $14.6 million mainly due to higher salaries as a result of salary adjustments; higher incentive compensation and higher profit-sharing expense, which is tied to the Corporation&#8217;s financial performance; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher professional fees by $13.7 million due to higher programming, processing and other technology services by $6.2 million mainly due to higher volume of transactions and higher advisory expense by $6.1 million related to higher increased customer activity and corporate initiatives related to compliance, fraud and cyber security among others; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher business promotions by $4.8 million due to higher customer reward program expense in our credit card business by $4.0 million. 

&#160; 

Operating expenses amounted to $808.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $64.9 million when compared with the same period of 2021, driven primarily by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher personnel cost by $22.1 million mainly due to higher salaries as a result of salary adjustments; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher equipment expense by $4.2 million due to higher software amortization expense; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating taxes by $4.3 million due to higher property taxes; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher professional fees by $22.3 million due to higher programming, processing and other technology services by $9.2 million mainly due to higher volume of transactions and higher advisory expense by $12.6 million related to higher increased customer activity and corporate initiatives related to compliance, fraud and cyber security among others; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher business promotions by $7.4 million due to higher customer reward program expense in our credit card business; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating expenses by $5.1 million due to lower gain on sale of foreclosed auto units and higher pension plan cost due to annual changes in actuarial assumptions; partially offset by lower write-down of foreclosed auto units.

Income Taxes 

For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $64.2 million and $114.7 million with an effective tax rate (&#8220;ETR&#8221;) of 23% and 21%, respectively, compared to $73.1 million and $149.9 million with an ETR of 25% and 24% for the respective periods of 2021. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower pre-tax income and higher tax exempt income for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2022, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset amounting to $0.8 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.6 billion. The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. operations was $0.2 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion. 

&#160; 

Refer to Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on the income tax expense and deferred tax asset balances.

&#160; 

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments for managerial reporting purposes consist of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. A Corporate grou p has been defined to support the reportable segments. 

&#160; 

For a description of the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments, including additional financial information and the underlying management accounting process, refer to Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

The Corporate group reported a net income of $4.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared with a net income of $6.6 million for the same quarter of the previous year . The decrease in net income was mainly attributed to higher salaries and higher professional services expense, offset by lower interest expense related to the redemption in the fourth quarter of 2021 of $186.7 million in Trust Preferred Securities issued by Popular Capital Trust I. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 the Corporate group reported net income of $11.1 million, compared to a net income of $8.9 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase in net income was due to lower interest expense from the redemption of the above mentioned Trust Preferred Securities, and higher earnings from equity method investments. 

&#160; 

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable segments are discussed below:

&#160; 

The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment&#8217;s net income amounted to $179.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared with net income of $193.3 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The results for the second quarter of 2021 reflect a release of the reserve for credit losses of $22.0 million, reflective of the credit metrics and macroeconomic outlook. The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher net interest income by $28.6 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest income from money market and investment securities by $30.2 million due to higher average balances of U.S. Treasury securities and higher yields from money market investments due to balances maintained at the Federal Reserve; 

&#160; 

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest income from loans by $1.0 million mainly from commercial loans due to lower fees from PPP loans and lower income from mortgage loans due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher income from consumer loans and leases due to loan growth; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest expense on deposits by $0.6 million mainly due to higher costs, mainly from time deposits. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 was 3.02% compared to 2.91% for the same quarter in the previous year. The increase in net interest margin is driven by earnings assets mix and the higher rates for money market investments held at the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

&#61623; A provision for loan losses expense of $8.8 million, compared to a reserve release of $22.0 million in the second quarter of 2021, or an unfavorable variance of $30.8 million; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Non-interest income was higher by $8.3 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other service fees by $5.7 million mainly due to higher credit card fees as a result of higher interchange transactional volumes; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher income from mortgage banking activities by $6.2 million due to a favorable variance in the fair value adjustment for MSRs and higher realized gains on closed derivative positions; partially offset by lower gain on sale of mortgage loans and securitization activity; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower other operating income by $2.6 million mostly due to lower earnings from the portfolio of equity method investments. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher operating expenses by $29.8 million mostly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher personnel costs by $12.8 million driven by higher salaries and benefits due to salary adjustments; higher incentive compensation and higher profit sharing expense; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other taxes by $2.3 million, mainly from personal property taxes; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher professional fees by $4.5 million due mainly to processing and technology fees; 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher business promotions by $4.3 million due to credit cards rewards expense as a result of higher transactional volumes; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher other operating expenses by $6.2 million due to higher charges allocated from the Corporate segment, mainly advisory services; 

&#160; 

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher net recoveries from OREO by $3.3 million due mainly to higher gains on sale of commercial and residential properties and lower write-downs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower income tax expense by $10.0 million mainly due to lower income before tax. 

&#160; 

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the BPPR segment recorded net income of $358.2 million compared to a net income of $405.5 million for the same period of the previous year.

The other factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher net interest income by $33.4 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; higher interest income from money market and investment securities by $45.9 million due to higher average balances of U.S. Treasury securities and higher yields from money market investments due to balances maintained at the Federal Reserve; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest expense on deposits by $1.5 million mainly due to lower costs, offset by higher average balances; 

&#160; 

partially offset by 

&#160; 

&#61623; lower interest income from loans by $14.0 million mainly from commercial loans due to lower fees and average balances from PPP loans and lower income from mortgage loans due to lower average balances, partially offset by higher income from consumer loans and leases due to loan growth; and 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was 2.84% compared to 3.00% for the same quarter in the previous year. The decrease in net interest margin is driven by earnings assets mix.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Non-interest income was higher by $9.1 million mainly due to:

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other service fees by $12.4 million mainly due to higher credit card fees as a result of higher interchange transactional volumes; 

&#160; 

partially offset by

Deposits 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $65.3 billion at June 30, 2022, compared to $67.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The deposits decrease of $1.7 billion was mainly due to lower Puerto Rico public sector deposits by $3.3 billion at BPPR, partially offset by growth in other deposits sectors. At June 30, 2022, Puerto Rico public sector deposits amounted to $17.1 billion. The receipt by the Puerto Rico Government of additional COVID-19 pandemic and hurricane recovery related Federal assistance, and seasonal tax collections, could increase public deposit balances at BPPR in the near term. However, the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the speed at which COVID-19 pandemic and hurricane recovery federal assistance is distributed, the financial condition, liquidity and cash management practices of the Puerto Rico Government and its instrumentalities and the implementation of fiscal and debt adjustment plans approved pursuant to PROMESA or other actions mandated by the Fiscal Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;).

[1] The CECL transitional amount includes the impact of Popular's adoption of the new CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020. 

&#160; 

The Basel III capital rules provide that a depository institution will be deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based ratio of at least 10%. Management has determined that as of June 30, 2022, the Corporation, BPPR and PB continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation elected to use the five-year transition period option as provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective March 31, 2020. The five-year transition period provision delays for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. As of June 30, 2022, the Corporation had phased-in 25% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remainder of the three-year transition period. 

&#160; 

On April 9, 2020, federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule to modify the Basel III regulatory capital rules applicable to banking organizations to allow those organizations participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the program. Specifically, the agencies have clarified that banking organizations, including the Corporation and its Bank subsidiaries, are permitted to assign a zero percent risk weight to PPP loans for purposes of determining risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, in order to facilitate use of the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (the &#8220;PPPL Facility&#8221;), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation&#8217;s Bank subsidiaries to fund PPP loans, the agencies further clarified that, for purposes of determining leverage ratios, a banking organization is permitted to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a PPPL Facility. As of June 30, 2022, the Corporation has $89 million in PPP loans and no loans were pledge as collateral for PPPL Facilities. 

&#160; 

The decrease in the common equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio, and total capital ratio as of June 30, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was mainly attributed to the accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase an aggregate of $400 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock, and an increase in risk-weighted assets driven by the growth in the commercial loans portfolio, partially offset by the six month period earnings. The increase in leverage capital ratio was mainly due to the decrease in average total assets, which mostly did not have a significant impact on the risk-weighted assets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-GAAP financial measures 

The tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share, which are presented in the table that follows, are non-GAAP measures. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method for mergers and acquisitions. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the Corporation&#8217;s capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets and/or liabilities. 

Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale amounted to $26.3 billion as of June 30, 2022. Other assets subject to market risk include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $29 million, mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $130 million and securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted to $32 million, as of June 30, 2022. 

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and option risks. In managing interest rate risk, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. 

Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII simulation modeling is prepared for a five-year period, which in conjunction with the EVE analysis, provides management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the Corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs. 

Management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various NII simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. For example, the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates, implied forwards, and parallel and non-parallel rate shocks. Management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures. 

The asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis. In addition, the model and processes used to assess IRR are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the Model Governance and Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude (parallel shifts). The rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of -100, -200, +100, +200 and +400 basis points during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses are based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes, interest rate spreads, loan prepayments and deposit elasticity. Thus, they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates. Additionally, the Company is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities, as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment. By their nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future. The following table presents the results of the simulations at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

As of June 30, 2022, NII simulations show the Corporation maintains an asset sensitive position, meaning that changes in net interest income are primarily driven by changes in asset yields. In declining rate scenarios net interest income would fall, as changes in asset yields would decline faster and by a higher magnitude than liability costs. In rising rate scenarios asset sensitive banks usually benefit from faster changes in asset yields relative to deposit costs. However, in the case of Popular, its sensitivity profile is impacted by a large proportion of Puerto Rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates. As short-term rates have risen the cost of these deposits is now expected to increase in sync with market rates and therefore reduce the benefit in rising rate environments. As of June 30, 2022, Popular has an asymmetric sensitivity profile meaning that the rate of change in NII in declining rate scenarios is larger than it is in the rising rate scenarios. The sensitivity to rising rates is near neutral this quarter compared to a substantially asset sensitive position as of December 31, 2021. The primary reasons for the reduction in sensitivity are i) the realization of much of the expected benefit in net interest income given the higher interest rates observed during the first half of 2022 ii) a decrease in cash balances (which reprice instantaneously) via the deployment into longer term investments and loans and iii) the market indexed nature of Puerto Rico public sector deposits which represented $17.1 billion or 26% of deposits as of June 30, 2022. 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a third-party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity. Prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten (or lower prepayments could extend) the weighted average life of these portfolios. 

Trading 

The Corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries, BPPR and Popular Securities. Popular Securities&#8217; trading activities consist primarily of market-making activities to meet expected customers&#8217; needs related to its retail brokerage business, and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected short-term price movements. BPPR&#8217;s trading activities consist primarily of holding U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221; and hedging the related market risk with &#8220;TBA&#8221; (to-be-announced) market transactions. The objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from short-term market movements. In addition, BPPR uses forward contracts or TBAs to hedge its securitization pipeline. Risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with TBAs that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline. 

At June 30, 2022, the Corporation held trading securities with a fair value of $32 million, representing approximately 0.05% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets, compared with $30 million and 0.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. As shown in Table 11, the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries, which at June 30, 2022 were investment grade securities. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the trading portfolio also included $0.1 million in Puerto Rico government obligations. Trading instruments are recognized at fair value, with changes resulting from fluctuations in market prices, interest rates or exchange rates reported in current period earnings. The Corporation recognized net trading account gain of $51 thousand and a net trading account loss of $47 thousand, respectively, for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are limited by internal policies. For each of the two subsidiaries, the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5-day net value-at-risk (&#8220;VAR&#8221;), with a confidence level of 99%. The VAR measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. 

The Corporation&#8217;s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately $0.3 million for the last week in June 2022. There are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with VAR modeling, and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates. Backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses, in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy. 

In the opinion of management, the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the Corporation. 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations, finance expected future growth, fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the Corporation&#8217;s tolerance for liquidity risk, including approving relevant risk limits and policies. The Board of Directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the Board&#8217;s Risk Management Committee and the Asset/Liability Management Committee. The management of liquidity risk, on a long-term and day-to-day basis, is the responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Division. The Corporation&#8217;s Corporate Treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors and for monitoring the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis. Also, the Corporate Treasury Division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process. The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies. 

An institution&#8217;s liquidity may be pressured if, for example, it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, its credit rating is downgraded, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution. Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. 

Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. It is also managed at the level of the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. As further explained below, a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies (the &#8220;BHCs&#8221;) are dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The Corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries. Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur. However, such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event, and are dependent on many assumptions. 

Deposits, including customer deposits, brokered deposits and public funds deposits, continue to be the most significant source of funds for the Corporation, funding 91% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets at June 30, 2022 and 89% at December 31, 2021. The 

&#160; 

ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 47% at June 30, 2022, compared to 44% at December 31, 2021. In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.0 billion in outstanding balances at June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $1.2 billion ). A detailed description of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings, including their terms, is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the Corporation&#8217;s cash inflows and outflows. 

On July 12, 2022, the Corporation completed its previously announced accelerated share repurchase program for the repurchase of an aggregate $400 million of Popular&#8217;s common stock, refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

The following sections provide further information on the Corporation&#8217;s major funding activities and needs, as well as the risks involved in these activities. 

Banking Subsidiaries 

Primary sources of funding for the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries (BPPR and PB or, collectively, &#8220;the banking subsidiaries&#8221;) include retail, commercial and public sector deposits, brokered deposits, unpledged investment securities, mortgage loan securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 

Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries. 

The principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations, investment portfolio purchases, loan purchases and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses. Also, the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments, recourse provisions, servicing advances, derivatives, credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by BPPR. 

The banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows. The Corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various factors, including pricing, service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results, credit ratings (by nationally recognized credit rating agencies), and importantly, FDIC deposit insurance. Although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits, management does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings. 

Deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates. Refer to Table 7 for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit under $250,000, excluding brokered deposits with denominations under $250,000. Core deposits have historically provided the Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled $61.4 billion, or 94% of total deposits, at June 30, 2022 , compared with $63.6 billion, or 95% of total deposits, at December 31, 2021 . Core deposits financed 90% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at June 30, 2022, compared with 88% at December 31, 2021 . 

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of $250,000 and over at June 30, 2022 is presented in the table that follows:

The Corporation had $1.0 billion in brokered deposits at June 30, 2022 , which financed approximately 1% of its total assets (December 31, 2021 - $0.8 billion and 1%, respectively) . In the event that any of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a well-capitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators, that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits, which may hinder the Corporation&#8217;s ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts. 

Deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the Corporation. As of June 30, 2022, total public sector deposits were $17.1 billion, compared to $20.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Generally, these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return. This, now unpledged, collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash. However, there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral. 

At June 30, 2022 , management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity. Finally, if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

Bank Holding Companies 

The principal sources of funding for the BHCs, which are Popular, Inc. (holding company only) and PNA, include cash on hand, investment securities, dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales, credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the BHCs. 

The principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt, and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest (related to trust preferred securities), the payment of dividends to common stockholders and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries. 

The BHCs have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their non-banking subsidiaries; however, the cash needs of the Corporation&#8217;s non-banking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal. These sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the Corporation below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which affects the Corporation&#8217;s cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

&#160; 

The outstanding balance of notes payable at the BHCs amounted to $497 million at June 30, 2022 and $496 million at December 31, 2021 . 

The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable at June 30, 2022 are presented in Table 13.

Annual debt service at the BHCs is approximately $32 million, and the Corporation&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.55 per share. The BHCs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all BHCs obligations during the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2022, the BHCs had cash and money markets investments totaling $264 million, borrowing potential of $193 million from its secured facility with BPPR. In addition to these liquidity sources, the stake in Evertec had a market value of $430 million as of June 30, 2022 and it represents an additional source of contingent liquidity. On July 1, 2022, the Corporation exchanged a portion of these shares as part of a transaction in which it acquired certain critical channels from Evertec and renegotiated several service agreements with Evertec, as discussed in Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The principal sources of funding for the non-banking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations, loan sales, repurchase agreements, capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies. The principal uses of funds for the non-banking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, operational expenses and payment of dividends to the BHCs. The liquidity needs of the non-banking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies. During the period ended June 30, 2022, Popular, Inc. made capital contributions to its wholly owned subsidiaries of $25 million to Popular Re, Inc. and $10 million to Popular Securities. 

Dividends 

During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Corporation declared cash dividends of $1.10 per common share outstanding ($84.2 million in the aggregate). The dividends for the Corporation&#8217;s Series A preferred stock amounted to $0.7 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the BHC&#8217;s received dividends amounting to $450 million from BPPR, $54 million from PNA $4 million in dividends from its non-banking subsidiaries and $1 million in dividends from Evertec. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2022, Popular International Bank Inc., wholly owned subsidiary of Popular, Inc., received $16 million in dividends from its investment in BHD. Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc.&#8217;s primary source of liquidity. 

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

The debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity, which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements. The Corporation&#8217;s debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets. The availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s unpledged debt securities amounted to $7.2 billion at June 30, 2022 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2021. A substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the U.S. money markets or from secured lending sources. 

Additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities, prepayments and sales. The loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets. In particular, mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have secondary markets which the Corporation could use. 

&#160; 

Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments 

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Corporation&#8217;s commitments to extent credit and other non-credit commitments. 

Other types of off-balance sheet arrangements that the Corporation enters in the ordinary course of business include derivatives, operating leases and provision of guarantees, indemnifications, and representation and warranties. Refer to Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on operating leases and to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion related to the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under credit recourse and representation and warranties arrangements. 

The Corporation monitors its cash requirements, including its contractual obligations and debt commitments. As discussed above, liquidity is managed by the Corporation in order to meet its short- and long-term cash obligations. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements has information on the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings by maturity, which amounted to $1.0 billion at June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $1.2 billion). 

&#160; 

Financial information of guarantor and issuers of registered guaranteed securities 

The Corporation (not including any of its subsidiaries, &#8220;PIHC&#8221;) is the parent holding company of Popular North America &#8220;PNA&#8221; and has other subsidiaries through which it conducts its financial services operations. PNA is an operating, 100% subsidiary of Popular, Inc. Holding Company (&#8220;PIHC&#8221;) and is the holding company of its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Equity One, Inc. and PB, including PB&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries Popular Equipment Finance, LLC, Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A., and E-LOAN, Inc. 

PNA has issued junior subordinated debentures guaranteed by PIHC (together with PNA, the &#8220;obligor group&#8221;) purchased by statutory trusts established by the Corporation. These debentures were purchased by the statutory trust using the proceeds from trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as &#8220;capital securities&#8221;), together with the proceeds of the related issuances of common securities of the trusts. 

PIHC fully and unconditionally guarantees the junior subordinated debentures issued by PNA. PIHC&#8217;s obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts to the holders of the applicable capital securities or by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions by the applicable trust except to the extent such trust has funds available for such payments. If PIHC does not make interest payments on the debentures held by such trust, such trust will not pay distributions on the applicable capital securities and will not have funds available for such payments. PIHC&#8217;s guarantee of PNA&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures is unsecured and ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the PIHC&#8217;s other liabilities in the same manner as the applicable debentures as set forth in the applicable indentures&#894; and equally with all other guarantees that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection, which means that the guaranteed party may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the respective guarantee without suing any other person or entity. 

The principal sources of funding for PIHC and PNA have included dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. As further described below, in the Risk to Liquidity section, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. 

The following summarized financial information presents the financial position of the obligor group, on a combined basis at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of their operations for the period ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. Investments in and equity in the earnings from the other subsidiaries and affiliates that are not members of the obligor group have been excluded. 

&#160; 

The summarized financial information of the obligor group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the obligor group eliminated. The obligor group's amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates have been presented in separate line items, if they are material. In addition, related parties transactions are presented separately.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Risks to Liquidity 

Total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis. Some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements, among other factors. Derivatives, such as those embedded in long-term repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps, and off-balance sheet exposures, such as recourse, performance bonds or credit card arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements. As their fair value increases, the collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of the Puerto Rico market for the Corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities. In the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico, the credit quality of the Corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs. Refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of this MD&#38;A for some highlights on the current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. In order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario, management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable. These plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms, such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the FHLB and the FRB. 

The credit ratings of Popular&#8217;s debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the Corporation&#8217;s ability to borrow in the capital markets, its cost and access to funding sources. Credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management, geographic concentration in Puerto Rico, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources, among other factors. 

Furthermore, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, after considering those years&#8217; dividend activity, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, BPPR declared cash dividends of $450 million. At June 30, 2022, BPPR would have needed to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before declaring a dividend due to its declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the latest three years. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. The ability of a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to its BHC could thus be impacted by its financial performance, thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the BHCs from the banking subsidiaries. This could, in turn, affect the BHCs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock, for example. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had $9 million in deposits at June 30, 2022 that are subject to rating triggers. 

In addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, as discussed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution&#8217;s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $34 million at June 30, 2022. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post 

&#160; 

collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. 

&#160;

Geographic and Government Risk 

&#160; 

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. The Corporation&#8217;s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Commonwealth&#8221; or &#8220;Puerto Rico&#8221;), which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

On December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally to other countries and jurisdictions, including the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels worldwide, including in the markets in which we do business. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the disease have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on economic activity worldwide, including in Puerto Rico. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect economic activity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic (including the appearance of new strains of the virus), the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the same, the pace of global vaccination efforts, and the amount of federal and local assistance offered to offset the impact of the pandemic. Pursuant to the 2022 Fiscal Plan (as defined below), economic stimulus measures have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity in Puerto Rico and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to offset the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact in the medium- and long-term. 

Economic Performance 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) contracted (in real terms) every fiscal year between 2007 and 2018, with the exception of fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the &#8220;Planning Board&#8221;) estimates, dated March 2021, the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP increased by 1.8% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Mar&#237;a. However, the Planning Board estimates that the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP decreased by approximately 3.2% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. The Planning Board projected that the negative effects of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2%, followed by 0.8% and 1.7% GNP growth in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively. 

Certain information regarding current economic activity is available in the form of the Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico (&#8220;EDB&#8221;) Economic Activity Index (the &#8220;EDB Economic Activity Index&#8221;), a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity. The latest EDB Economic Activity Index, which is an indicator of general economic activity and not a direct measurement of real GNP, reflected a 3.3% increase in May 2022, compared to May 2021. From July 2021 to May 2022, the EDB Economic Activity Index reflected a 4.7% increase compared to the same period in fiscal year 2021. The Puerto Rico Consumer Price Index, published by the Department of Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico, increased to 130.2 in June 2022, a 7.2% increase to the corresponding figure in June 2021. Over the same period, the United States Consumer Price Index, published by the U.S. Bureau 

&#160;

Fiscal Challenges 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s central government and many of its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities continue to face significant fiscal challenges, which have been primarily the result of economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy obligations, and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. As a result, the Commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities defaulted on their debt obligations. The escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in June 2016. As further discussed below under &#8220;Pending Title III Proceedings,&#8221; the Commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities recently emerged from a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA. 

PROMESA 

PROMESA, among other things, created a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;) with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the Commonwealth, its public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities and established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of such entities. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets, in accordance with modified accrual accounting, are produced for at least four consecutive years. 

In October 2016, the Oversight Board designated the Commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities (except its municipalities) as &#8220;covered entities&#8221; under PROMESA. In May 2019, the Oversight Board also designated all of the Commonwealth&#8217;s municipalities as covered entities. At the Oversight Board&#8217;s request, covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the Oversight Board for its review and approval. They are also required to seek Oversight Board approval to issue, guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of $10 million or more. Finally, covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. For additional discussion of risk factors related to the Puerto Rico fiscal challenges, see &#8220;Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; in the Corporation&#8217;s Form 10-K. 

Fiscal Plans 

Commonwealth Fiscal Plan . The Oversight Board has certified several fiscal plans for the Commonwealth since 2017. The most recent fiscal plan for the Commonwealth certified by the Oversight Board is dated January 27, 2022 (the &#8220;2022 Fiscal Plan&#8221;). 

Pursuant to the 2022 Fiscal Plan, while the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the same severely reduced economic activity and caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment in Puerto Rico, pandemic-related federal and local stimulus funding have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis. The 2022 Fiscal Plan&#8217;s economic projections incorporate adjustments for these short-term income effects for purposes of estimating tax receipts. For example, the 2022 Fiscal Plan estimates that, for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, real GNP will grow 2.6% and 0.9%, respectively, but projects that growth adjusted for income effects for such years will be approximately 5.2% and 0.6%, respectively. 

The 2022 Fiscal Plan incorporates the debt service costs of the Commonwealth&#8217;s restructured debt pursuant to the Plan of Adjustment (as defined and further explained below), and projects an unrestricted surplus after debt service averaging $1 billion annually between fiscal years 2022 to 2031. This surplus is projected to decline over time as federal disaster relief funding slows, nominal GNP growth declines, revenues decline, and healthcare expenditures rise. The 2022 Fiscal Plan estimates that fiscal measures could drive approximately $6.3 billion in savings and extra revenue over fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and that structural reforms could drive a cumulative 0.90% increase in growth by fiscal year 2051 (equal to approximately $33 billion). 

The 2022 Fiscal Plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of Commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of some municipalities. From fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2020, Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have decreased by approximately 64% (from approximately $370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $132 million in fiscal year 2020). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, reductions in appropriations to municipalities were paused in fiscal year 2021. Municipalities also received extraordinary appropriations and other 

&#160; 

funds from federally-funded programs during fiscal year 2022, which has helped temporarily offset the impact of the reduced Commonwealth support. However, the 2022 Fiscal Plan contemplates additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities each fiscal year, before eventually phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year 2025. Further, while the Commonwealth had enacted legislation in 2019 suspending the municipality&#8217;s obligations to contribute to the Commonwealth&#8217;s health plan and pay-as-you go retirement system, such legislation was challenged by the Oversight Board and eventually declared null by the Title III court in April 2020. As a result, municipalities are required to cover their own employees&#8217; healthcare costs and retirement benefits and had to reimburse the Commonwealth for such costs corresponding to the period during which the law was in effect. Finally, the 2022 Fiscal Plan notes that municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on Commonwealth appropriations and that this lack of fiscal management threatens the ability of municipalities to provide necessary services, such as health, sanitation, public safety, and emergency services to their residents, forcing them to prioritize expenditures. 

Other Fiscal Plans. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities. The certified fiscal plan for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (&#8220;PREPA&#8221;), Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric power utility, contemplated the transformation of Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric system through, among other things, the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to PREPA&#8217;s transmission and distribution system (the &#8220;T&#38;D System&#8221;), and calls for significant structural reforms at PREPA. The procurement process for the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to the T&#38;D System was completed in June 2020. The selected proponent, LUMA Energy LLC (&#8220;LUMA&#8221;), and PREPA entered into a 15-year agreement whereby, since June 1, 2021, LUMA is responsible for operating, maintaining and modernizing the T&#38;D System. 

On May 20, 2022, the Oversight Board certified the latest version of the fiscal plan (the &#8220;CRIM Fiscal Plan&#8221;) for the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (&#8220;CRIM&#8221;), the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities. The CRIM Fiscal Plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of Puerto Rico&#8217;s property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections, including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties, and implementing operational and technological initiatives. 

Title III Proceedings 

On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board, on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court to restructure the Commonwealth&#8217;s liabilities under Title III of PROMESA. The Oversight Board subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (&#8220;COFINA&#8221;), the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (&#8220;ERS&#8221;), the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (&#8220; HTA &#8221;), PREPA and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (&#8220;PBA&#8221;). On February 12, 2019, the government completed a restructuring of COFINA&#8217;s debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the U.S. District Court. 

On November 3, 2021, the Oversight Board filed the Eighth Amended Title III Joint Plan of Adjustment for the Commonwealth, ERS and PBA (the &#8220;Plan of Adjustment&#8221;). On March 15, 2022 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;), the Plan of Adjustment became effective. As of the Effective Date, the Plan of Adjustment reduced the Commonwealth&#8217;s debt obligations from approximately $34.3 billion of prepetition debt to approximately $7.4 billion in new general obligation bonds and approximately $8.7 billion in new contingent value instruments. This also resulted in a reduction of the Commonwealth&#8217;s maximum annual debt service by approximately 73%. 

There are still ongoing debt restructuring processes under Title III of PROMESA for the Commonwealth&#8217;s highways and electric power authorities (HTA and PREPA). 

Exposure of the Corporation 

&#160; 

The credit quality of BPPR&#8217;s loan portfolio reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. While PROMESA provided a process to address the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal challenges, the complexity and uncertainty of the PROMESA Title III proceedings for the Commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans still present significant economic risks. Furthermore, if global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board are unable to adequately manage the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges, including by controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and consummating an orderly restructuring of the Commonwealth&#8217;s debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government&#8217;s instrumentalities and municipalities totaled $396 million of which $353 million were outstanding, compared to $367 million at December 31, 2021, of which $349 million were outstanding. A deterioration in the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us. Of the amount outstanding, $326 million consists of loans and $27million are securities ($319 million and $30 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021). All of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure outstanding at June 30, 2022 were obligations from various Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases, these were &#8220;general obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or &#8220;special obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At June 30, 2022, 73% of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam&#243;n. For additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to Note 20 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies. 

&#160; 

In addition, at June 30, 2022, the Corporation had $262 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities, but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental ($275 million at December 31, 2021). These included $220 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December 31, 2021 - $232 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Corporation also had, at June 30, 2022, $42 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions (December 31, 2021 - $43 million). In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. The Corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, a moratorium on such obligations has not been imposed as of the date hereof. 

&#160; 

BPPR&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal and economic measures taken by the Commonwealth government. Similarly, BPPR&#8217;s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees, which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2022, BPPR had $17.1 billion in deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the speed at which COVID-19 pandemic and hurricane recovery federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition, liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. 

&#160; 

The Corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the Oversight Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

United States Virgin Islands 

&#160; 

The Corporation has operations in the United States Virgin Islands (the &#8220;USVI&#8221;) and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. 

&#160; 

The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges, which have been and might be further exacerbated as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2022, the Corporation had approximately $29 million in direct exposure to USVI government entities (December 31, 2021 - $70 million). The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. 

British Virgin Islands 

&#160; 

The Corporation has operations in the British Virgin Islands (&#8220;BVI&#8221;), which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy. Although the Corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the BVI, at June 30, 2022 it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately $217 million comprised of various retail and commercial clients, compared to a loan portfolio of $221 million at December 31, 2021. 

&#160; 

U.S. Government 

&#160; 

As further detailed in Notes 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities represented exposure to the U.S. Government in the form of U.S. Government sponsored entities, as well as agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.5 billion of residential mortgages, $89 million of SBA loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and $69 million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies at June 30, 2022 (compared to $1.6 billion, $353 million and $67 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) include primarily past-due loans that are no longer accruing interest, renegotiated loans, and real estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented in Table 16. 

During the second quarter of 2022, the Corporation continued to exhibit strong credit quality trends and low credit costs with low level of NCOs and decreasing NPLs. We continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance, given potential economic headwinds, rising interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. However, management believes that the improvement over the last few years in the risk profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios positions Popular to operate successfully under the current challenging environment. 

Total NPAs decreased by $63 million at June 30, 2022 when compared with December 31, 2021. Total non-performing loans held-in-portfolio (&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) decreased by $70 million at June 30, 2022 from December 31, 2021. BPPR&#8217;s NPLs decreased by $69 million at June 30, 2022, mainly driven by lower mortgage NPLs by $49 million, due to the combined effects of collection efforts, increased foreclosure activity and the on-going low levels of early delinquency compared with pre-pandemic trends, coupled with a $24 million decrease in the commercial NPLs. Popular U.S. NPLs remained essentially flat at $33 million from December 31, 2021. At June 30, 2022, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.6% compared to 1.9% in the December 31, 2021. Other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) increased by $7 million at June 30, 2022, mainly due to the end of the COVID-19 related foreclosure moratorium period. 

At June 30, 2022, NPLs secured by real estate amounted to $353 million in the Puerto Rico operations and $28 million in Popular U.S. These figures were $428 million and $31 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 

The Corporation&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) amounted to $9.1 billion at June 31, 2022, of which $2.9 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, compared with $8.4 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the Corporation reclassified $0.9 billion of loans from the Commercial Real Estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) Non-Owner-Occupied category to the CRE Owner-Occupied category. The selected loans are primarily to skilled and assisted living nursing homes where the majority of the revenues, which are the basis for the repayment of the loans, are generated from medical and related operational activities. These loans meet the type of business and source requirements as defined in the regulatory guidance allowing this classification. CRE NPLs amounted to $55 million at June 30, 2022, compared with $77 million at December 

&#160; 

31, 2021. The CRE NPL ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments were 1.23% and 0.04%, respectively, at June 30, 2022, compared with 1.95% and 0.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 

In addition to the NPLs included in Table 16, at June 30, 2022, there were $382 million of performing loans, mainly commercial loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, were currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2021 - $214 million). 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, total inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio, excluding consumer loans, decreased by approximately $46 million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2021. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment decreased by $45 million compared to the same period in 2021, driven by lower commercial and mortgage inflows by $38 million and $7 million, respectively. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. segment remained essentially flat from the same period in 2021.

[1] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

[2] It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. The balance of these loans includes $11 million at June 30, 2022, related to the rebooking of loans previously pooled into GNMA securities, in which the Corporation had a buy-back option as further described below (December 31, 2021 - $13 million). Under the GNMA program, issuers such as BPPR have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to repurchases option are required to be reflected (rebooked) on the financial statements of BPPR with an offsetting liability. These balances include $237 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $304 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $43 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31, 2021 - $50 million).

[1] Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.6 billion of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021 - $0.6 billion). Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information of guaranteed loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation, management considers current conditions, macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period, historical loss experience, portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics, results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans, and regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

&#160; 

The Corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. Other factors that can affect management&#8217;s estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold, may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses. Consequently, the business financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could also be affected. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2022, the allowance for credit losses amounted to $682 million, a decrease of $14 million, when compared with December 31, 2021. The ACL incorporated updated macroeconomic scenarios for Puerto Rico and the United States. Given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple scenarios to estimate its ACL. The baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario. 

&#160; 

The current baseline forecast continues to show a favorable economic scenario. 2022 annualized GDP growth of 2.8% is expected for both Puerto Rico and the United States, compared to 3.5% and 3.7%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Changes in assumptions related to fiscal stimulus, higher energy prices and tighter financial market conditions contributed to the reduction. The 2022 average unemployment rate is forecasted at 6.9% and 3.5% for Puerto Rico and the United States, respectively, improving from 7.3% and 3.6%, respectively, in the previous forecast. Puerto Rico&#8217;s unemployment rate forecast benefits from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (&#8220;BLS&#8221;) revisions that show a stronger than expected labor market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The ACL for BPPR decreased by $14 million to $581 million at June 30, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021. The ACL for Popular U.S. remained flat at $101 million at June 30, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021 . The decrease in BPPR&#8217;s ACL was mainly driven by reductions in qualitative reserves due to substantial improvements in employment levels in Puerto Rico. This contributed to a lower commercial, mortgage and consumer loans ACL. The decrease in qualitative reserves was partially offset by the impact of higher loan volumes and changes in the macroeconomic scenario. 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, amounted to $9.9 million, compared to a net benefit of $17.5 million in the same period in the prior year . The increase was prompted by higher NCOs, as the prior period was a recovery of $1.3 million, compared to $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, coupled with the ACL releases explained above. Refer to Note 8 &#8211; Allowance for credit losses &#8211; loans held-in-portfolio, and to the Provision for Credit Losses section of this MD&#38;A for additional information.

NCOs for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 amounted to $6.1 million, an unfavorable variance by $7.4 million when compared to the same period in 2021. The BPPR segment increased by $6.8 million mainly driven by higher commercial and consumer NCOs by $6.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in part offset by a decrease of $5.4 million in the mortgage NCOs. The commercial NCOs reflects an unfavorable variance of $6.5 million, as the prior period was a net recovery of $9.9 million. The consumer NCOs increase was mainly related to post-pandemic normalization, as NCOs continue at historical low levels. The PB segment NCOs remained essentially flat. The low level of NCOs was due to the effect of a favorable economic environment and continued borrower performance, as reflected in the ongoing low level of delinquencies and NPLs when compared to pre-pandemic trends.
