FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-K contains  “forward-looking statements”  within the  meaning of the U.S. Private  Securities Litigation  Reform Act  of
1995,  including,  without  limitation,  statements  about  Popular,  Inc.’s  (the  “Corporation,”  “Popular,”  “we,”  “us,”  “our”)  business,
financial condition, results  of operations, plans,  objectives and future  performance. These statements  are not  guarantees of future
performance,  are  based  on  management’s current  expectations and,  by  their  nature,  involve  risks,  uncertainties,  estimates and
assumptions. Potential factors, some  of which  are beyond  the Corporation’s  control, could  cause actual  results to  differ materially
from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect
of competitive and economic factors, and our reaction to those factors,  the adequacy of the allowance for loan  losses, delinquency
trends, market risk and the impact of interest rate changes, capital markets conditions, capital adequacy and liquidity,  and the effect
of legal and regulatory proceedings and new accounting standards on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations.
All statements  contained herein  that are  not clearly  historical in  nature are  forward-looking, and  the words  “anticipate,” “believe,”
“continues,” “expect,”  “estimate,” “intend,”  “project” and  similar expressions  and future  or conditional  verbs such  as “will,”  “would,”
“should,” “could,” “might,” “can,” “may” or similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements.

Various factors, some of which are beyond Popular’s control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in,
or implied by, such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the rate of
growth or decline in the  economy and employment levels, as well  as general business and economic  conditions in the  geographic
areas we serve and, in particular, in  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico  (the “Commonwealth” or “Puerto Rico”), where  a significant
portion of our business is concentrated; adverse economic conditions, including high levels of inflation, that adversely affect housing
prices, the  job market,  consumer confidence  and spending  habits which  may affect  in turn,  among other  things, our  level of  non-
performing assets,  charge-offs and provision expense;  changes in  interest rates and market liquidity,  which may  reduce interest
margins,  impact  funding  sources,  reduce  loan  originations,  affect  our  ability  to  originate  and  distribute  financial  products  in  the
primary and secondary markets and impact the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to return capital to our shareholders;
the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative media coverage of the banking industry in
general  on  investor  and  depositor  sentiment  regarding  the  stability  and  liquidity  of  banks;  the  impact  of  the  current  fiscal  and
economic challenges  of Puerto  Rico and the measures taken and  to be  taken by  the Puerto  Rico Government and  the Federally-
appointed oversight board on the economy,  our customers and our business; the impact of  pending debt restructuring proceedings
under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act  (“PROMESA”) and of other actions taken or to
be taken to  address Puerto Rico’s fiscal  challenges on the value  of our portfolio of  Puerto Rico government securities and loans to
governmental entities and  of our commercial, mortgage  and consumer loan  portfolios where private borrowers  could  be directly
affected by  governmental action; the  amount of Puerto  Rico public sector  deposits held at  the Corporation, whose  future balances
are uncertain  and difficult  to predict  and may  be impacted  by factors  such as  the amount  of Federal  funds received  by the  P.R.
Government and the  rate of expenditure of  such funds, as  well as the financial condition, liquidity and  cash management practices
of  the  Puerto  Rico  Government and  its  instrumentalities;  unforeseen or  catastrophic  events,  including  extreme  weather  events,
including  hurricanes,  other  natural  disasters,  man-made  disasters,  acts  of  violence  or  war  or  pandemics,  epidemics  and  other
health-related crises,  or the  fear of  any such  event occurring,  any of  which could  cause adverse  consequences for  our business,
including,  but  not  limited  to,  disruptions  in  our  operations;  our  ability  to  achieve  the  expected  benefits  from  our  transformation
initiative, including  our ability  to achieve  projected earnings,  efficiencies and  our targeted  sustainable return  on tangible  common
equity of 14% by the end of 2025; risks related to Popular’s acquisition of certain information technology and related assets formerly
used by  Evertec, Inc.  to service  certain of  Banco Popular  de Puerto  Rico’s key  channels, as  well as  the entry  into amended  and
restated commercial  agreements (the  “Evertec Business  Acquisition Transaction”);  the fiscal  and monetary  policies of  the federal
government  and  its  agencies;  changes  in  federal  bank  regulatory  and  supervisory  policies,  including  required  levels  of  capital,
liquidity, resolution-related requirements and the impact of other proposed capital standards on our capital ratios; additional Federal
Deposit Insurance  Corporation (“FDIC”)  assessments, such  as the special  assessment implemented  by the FDIC to  recover the
losses to the  deposit insurance fund (“DIF”) resulting from  the receiverships of  Silicon Valley  Bank and Signature  Bank; regulatory
approvals  that  may  be  necessary  to  undertake  certain  actions  or  consummate  strategic  transactions,  such  as  acquisitions  and
dispositions; the  relative strength  or weakness of  the consumer  and commercial  credit sectors  and of  the real  estate markets  in
Puerto Rico and the  other markets in which our borrowers are located; a deterioration in the  credit quality of our clients, customers
and  counterparties;  the  performance  of  the  stock  and  bond  markets;  competition  in  the  financial  services  industry;  possible
legislative,  tax  or  regulatory changes;  a  failure  in  or  breach  of  our  operational  or  security  systems  or  infrastructure  or  those  of
Evertec, Inc., our provider  of core financial transaction  processing and information technology services,  or of third parties providing
services to us,  including as a  result of cyberattacks, e-fraud, denial-of-services and computer intrusion, that might  result in, among
other things, loss or breach of customer data, disruption of services, reputational damage or additional costs to Popular; changes  in
market  rates  and  prices  which  may  adversely  impact  the  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities;  potential  judgments,  claims,

54

damages, penalties, fines, enforcement actions and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory or
government  investigations  or  actions;  changes  in  accounting  standards,  rules  and  interpretations;  our  ability  to  grow  our  core
businesses;  decisions  to  downsize,  sell  or  close  branches  or  business  units  or  otherwise  change  our  business  mix;  and
management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks.

Moreover,  the  outcome  of  legal  and  regulatory  proceedings,  as  discussed  in  “Part  I,  Item  3.  Legal  Proceedings,”  is  inherently
uncertain and depends on judicial interpretations of law and the findings of regulators, judges and/or juries. Investors should refer to
“Part I, Item 1A” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties to which the Corporation is subject.

All forward-looking  statements included  in this  Form 10-K  are based  upon information  available to  Popular as  of the  date of  this
Form 10- K, and other than as required by law,  including the requirements of applicable securities laws, we assume no obligation to
update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date
of such statements.

OVERVIEW

The Corporation is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board  of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the United States (“U.S.”) mainland, and
the  U.S.  and  British Virgin  Islands. In  Puerto  Rico, the  Corporation provides  retail, mortgage,  and commercial  banking services
through its principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (“BPPR”), as well as investment banking, broker-dealer, auto
and  equipment  leasing  and  financing,  and  insurance  services  through  specialized  subsidiaries.  In  the  U.S.  mainland,  the
Corporation provides  retail, mortgage,  commercial banking  services, as well  as equipment  leasing and  financing, through  its New
York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (“PB” or “Popular U.S.”) which has branches located in New York, New Jersey and
Florida. Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents information about the Corporation’s business segments.

YEAR 2023 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS

Issuance and Redemption of Senior Notes

On March  13, 2023,  the Corporation  issued $400  million aggregate  principal amount  of 7.25%  Senior Notes  due 2028  (the “2028
Notes”) in an underwritten public offering. The Corporation used a portion of the net proceeds of the 2028 Notes offering to redeem,
on August 14, 2023, the outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes due September 2023. The
redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.

FDIC Special Assessment

On  November  16,  2023,  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (“FDIC”)  approved  a  final  rule  that  imposes  a  special
assessment (the “FDIC  Special Assessment”) to recover the losses to the deposit  insurance fund (“DIF”) resulting from the  FDIC’s
use,  in  March  2023,  of  the  systemic  risk  exception to  the  least-cost resolution  test  under  the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act  in
connection with the receiverships of several failed banks.

Under the final rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s  (“IDI”) estimated
uninsured deposits,  as reported  in the  IDI’s December 31,  2022 Call  Report, excluding  the first  $5 billion  in estimated  uninsured
deposits. For a holding company that has more than one IDI subsidiary, such as Popular, the $5 billion exclusion is allocated among
the company’s IDI subsidiaries in proportion to  each IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments will be collected
at an annual rate of approximately 13.4  basis points per year  (3.35 basis points per  quarter) over eight quarters  in 2024 and 2025,
with  the  first  assessment period beginning  January  1,  2024. In  their  December  31,  2022  Call  Reports, BPPR  and  PB  reported
estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $28.1 billion, including $16.2 billion in fully collateralized public sector deposits, and
$3.5 billion,  respectively.  The Corporation  recorded an  expense of  $71.4 million,  $45.3 million  net of  tax, in the  fourth quarter  of
2023, representing the full amount of the assessment.

55

 
 
 
By statute, the FDIC is required to recover the loss arising from the use of a systemic risk determination through one or more special
assessments. As of  December 31, 2023,  the FDIC’s  loss estimate described  in the final rule had increased by  approximately $4.1
billion to $20.4 billion, or approximately 25%.  The exact amount of losses will be determined when the FDIC terminates the  related
receiverships considered  in the  final rule.  Accordingly,  the special  assessment amount  and collection  period may  change as  the
estimated  loss  is  periodically  adjusted  or  if  the  total  amount  collected  varies.  If  the most recent  increase  in  the  FDIC’s
estimate remains unchanged and is assessed  in the same manner,  the Corporation estimates that  the incremental expense for  the
FDIC Special Assessment could be approximately $18 million. 

Increase in quarterly common stock dividends

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.62 per share, an increase
of $0.07, or 13%, compared to the $0.55 per share declared by the Corporation in the third quarter of 2023.

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 

Net  interest  income,  on  a  taxable  equivalent  basis,  is  presented  with  its  different  components  in  Table  3  for  the  year  ended
December 31,  2023 as compared  with the same  period in  2022, segregated  by major categories  of interest earning assets  and
interest-bearing liabilities. 

The interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The
main  sources  of  tax-exempt  interest  income  are  certain  investments  in  obligations  of  the  U.S.  Government,  its  agencies  and
sponsored  entities,  and  certain  obligations  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  and  its  agencies  and  assets  held  by  the
Corporation’s international  banking entities. To  facilitate the  comparison of  all interest  related to  these assets,  the interest  income
has  been converted to  a taxable equivalent  basis, using the  applicable statutory income tax  rates for  each  period.  The taxable
equivalent computation  considers the  interest expense  and other  related expense  disallowances required  by the  Puerto Rico  tax
law. Under Puerto Rico tax law,  the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. Net interest income, on a
taxable  equivalent  basis,  is  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure.  Management  believes  that  this  presentation  provides  meaningful
information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and exempt sources.

Net interest  income, on  a taxable  equivalent basis,  as used  by the  Corporation may  not be  comparable to  similarly named  non-
GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023

The Corporation’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $541.3 million, compared to a net income of $1.1
billion for 2022.

Net interest income for the  year ended December  31, 2023 was  $2.1 billion, a decrease of $35.8  million when compared  to 2022.
The decrease in net interest income was  mainly driven by higher interest expense from  deposits, mainly due to higher  cost of the
Puerto Rico government  deposits and  the increase  in cost  of Popular  U.S. deposits.  The net  interest margin  for the  year ended
December  31,  2023  was  3.13%  compared  to  3.11%  for  the  same  period  in  2022,  driven  by  a  full  year  impact,  on  the  cost  of
deposits, of the  increase, in 2022, of 400 basis  points in the  Federal Funds Rate and an additional 100 basis points  in 2023. On  a
taxable equivalent basis,  net interest  margin was 3.31% in  2023, compared  to 3.46% in  2022. Refer  to the Net Interest  Income
section of this MD&A for additional information.

The  Corporation’s total  provision for  credit  losses of $208.6  million for  the year  ended December 31, 2023, compared to  $83.0
million for  2022. The  higher expense for the  year 2023  was driven by higher  reserves in  our consumer  and commercial portfolios
mostly  due  to  changes  in  credit  quality  and  higher  loan  volumes.  The  Corporation’s  consumer  loans  portfolios  continued  to
experience  credit  quality  normalization.  While,  non-performing  loans  (“NPLs”)  and  net  charge  offs  (“NCOs”)  continued  below
historical pre-pandemic  averages, consumer portfolios,  however,  reflected credit  quality deterioration  in certain  areas, particularly
the unsecured personal loans and credit cards portfolios, with delinquencies and NCOs near or exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The
auto loans portfolio  also showed credit  normalization, however, metrics remained below  pre-pandemic levels. The commercial and
mortgage portfolios continue to operate with historically low levels of NCOs and NPLs. Non-performing assets totaled $438.0 million
at December 31,  2023, reflecting  a decrease  of $90.5  million when  compared to  December 31,  2022. Refer to  the Provision  for
Credit Losses and Credit Risk sections of this MD&A for information on the allowance for credit losses, non-performing assets, loan
modifications to borrowers with financial difficulties, net charge-offs and credit quality metrics.

Non-interest  income  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023  amounted  to  $650.7  million,  a  decrease  of  $246.3  million,  when
compared with 2022, mostly due to the $257.7 million gain related to  the Evertec Transactions and related accounting adjustments
during 2022. Refer to the Non-Interest Income section of this MD&A for additional information on the major variances of the different
categories of non-interest income.

Total operating expenses amounted to $1.9 billion for the year 2023, reflecting an increase of $151.7 million, when compared to the
same  period  in  2022,  mainly  due  to  the  FDIC  Special  Assessment  of  $71.4  million,  higher  personnel  costs  reflecting  salary
increases and a higher headcount, a higher goodwill impairment charge in our U.S. based equipment leasing subsidiary, and higher
processing and transactional services expenses. Refer to the Operating Expenses section of this MD&A for additional information.

Income tax expense amounted to $134.2 million  for the year ended December 31, 2023,  compared with an income tax expense of
$132.3 million for  the previous year.  The income tax  expense for the  year was impacted  by the composition  and source of  taxable
income, including lower tax exempt income and lower income subject to preferential tax rates. The income tax expense of year 2022
benefited from the partial reversal of $68.2 million of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance of the  U. S. operations, the sale of

59

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evertec shares, taxable at a  preferential rate,  and a higher tax  exempt income net of disallowance. Refer to the Income Taxes
section in this MD&A and Note 35 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.

At December  31, 2023,  the Corporation’s  total assets  were $70.8  billion, compared  with $67.6  billion at  December 31,  2022. The
increase of $3.1 billion is  mainly driven by an increase in loans held-in-portfolio mainly in the commercial, consumer, and mortgage
portfolios. Refer to the Statement of Financial Condition Analysis section of this MD&A for additional information.

Deposits amounted to  $63.6 billion at  December 31, 2023,  compared with $61.2  billion at December 31, 2022. Table  8 presents a
breakdown of deposits by major  categories. The increase in deposits was mainly due to higher Puerto Rico public funds at  BPPR
and time deposits at  PB. The Corporation’s borrowings amounted to $1.1 billion at  December 31, 2023, compared to  $1.4 billion at
December  31,  2022.  Refer  to  Note  17  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  detailed  information  on  the  Corporation’s
borrowings.

Refer  to  Table  7  in  the  Statement  of  Financial  Condition  Analysis  section  of  this  MD&A  for  the  percentage  allocation  of  the
composition of the Corporation’s financing to total assets.

Stockholders’ equity amounted to $5.1  billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $4.1 billion at  December 31, 2022. The increase
was  principally  due  to  lower  accumulated  unrealized  losses  on  debt  securities  available-for-sale,  lower  accumulated  unrealized
losses on debt securities previously reclassified to  held-to-maturity,  and the  net income  for the year,  partially offset  by declared
dividends. The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries continue to be well-capitalized at December 31, 2023. The Common Equity
Tier 1 Capital ratio at December 31, 2023 was 16.30%, compared to 16.39% at December 31, 2022.

The shares of the Corporation’s common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol BPOP. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES

The accounting and  reporting policies followed by  the Corporation and its  subsidiaries conform with generally  accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America  (“GAAP”) and general practices within  the financial services  industry. The  Corporation’s
significant accounting policies  are described  in detail in  Note 2  to the  Consolidated Financial  Statements and  should be read in
conjunction with this section. 

Critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and  assumptions, which involve significant  judgment about the
effect of matters  that are inherently uncertain  and that involve a  high degree of subjectivity.  These estimates are made  under facts
and circumstances  at a  point in  time and  changes in  those facts  and circumstances  could produce  actual results  that differ  from
those estimates. The  following MD&A  section is  a summary  of what  management considers  the Corporation’s  critical accounting
policies and estimates.

Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments

The Corporation currently measures  at fair  value on  a recurring basis its  trading debt securities, debt  securities available-for-sale,
certain equity securities,  derivatives and mortgage servicing  rights. Occasionally,  the Corporation is  required to record  at fair value
other assets  on a  nonrecurring basis, such as  loans held-for-sale, loans  held-in-portfolio that are collateral  dependent and certain
other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically result from the application of lower of  cost or fair value accounting
or write-downs of individual assets. 

The Corporation categorizes  its assets and  liabilities measured  at fair  value under  the three-level  hierarchy.  The level  within the
hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for fair value measurement are observable.

The  Corporation  requires  the  use  of  observable  inputs  when  available,  in  order  to  minimize  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs  to
determine fair value. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are  not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing  in those  securities. The  amount of  judgment involved  in estimating  the fair  value of  a financial  instrument depends

60

upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market  parameters. In addition, it may be affected by other factors such
as the type of instrument,  the liquidity of  the market for  the instrument, transparency  around the inputs  to the valuation,  as well as
the  contractual  characteristics of  the  instrument. Broker  quotes  used  for  fair  value  measurements  inherently  reflect  any  lack  of
liquidity in the market since they represent an exit price from the perspective of the market participants.

Trading Debt Securities and Debt Securities Available-for-Sale

The  majority  of  the  values  for  trading  debt  securities  and  debt securities  available-for-sale are  obtained from  third-party  pricing
services and  are validated  with alternate  pricing sources  when available.  Securities not  priced by  a secondary  pricing source  are
documented  and  validated  internally  according  to  their  significance  to  the  Corporation’s  financial  statements.  Management  has
established materiality thresholds according to the investment class to monitor and investigate material deviations in prices obtained
from the primary pricing service provider and the secondary pricing source used as support for the valuation results. 

Inputs are evaluated to  ascertain that they consider current  market conditions, including the relative liquidity of the market. When a
market quote  for a  specific security  is not  available, the  pricing service  provider generally  uses observable  data to  derive an  exit
price  for  the  instrument, such  as  benchmark yield  curves  and  trade  data  for  similar  products. To  the  extent  trading  data  is  not
available, the pricing service provider  relies on specific  information including dialogue  with brokers, buy side clients,  credit ratings,
spreads to  established benchmarks and  transactions on similar  securities, to draw correlations based  on the characteristics of the
evaluated instrument. If  for any  reason the pricing  service provider cannot  observe data required  to feed its model, it discontinues
pricing the instrument.

Furthermore, management assesses the fair value of its portfolio of investment securities at least on a quarterly basis. Securities are
classified  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy  according  to  product  type,  characteristics  and  market  liquidity.  At  the  end  of  each  period,
management assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. The fair value measurement analysis performed
by  the  Corporation  includes  validation  procedures  and  review  of  market  changes,  pricing  methodology,  assumption  and  level
hierarchy changes, and evaluation of distressed transactions. 

Refer to Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for  a description of  the Corporation’s valuation methodologies used  for
the assets and liabilities measured at fair value.

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses 

Interest on loans is accrued and recorded as interest income based upon the principal amount outstanding.

Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all
previously accrued and unpaid interest  is charged against  interest income and the loan is  accounted for  either on  a cash-basis
method or  on the  cost-recovery method.  Loans designated  as non-accruing  are returned  to accrual  status when  the Corporation
expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. The determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan’s
balance may involve management’s judgment in the evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects for repayment.

Refer to  the MD&A  section titled  Credit Risk,  particularly the  Non-performing assets  sub-section, for  a detailed  description of  the
Corporation’s non-accruing and charge-off policies by major loan categories. 

One of  the most  critical and  complex accounting  estimates is  associated with the determination  of the  allowance for  credit losses
(“ACL”).  The  Corporation  establishes  an  ACL  for  its  loan  portfolio  based  on  its  estimate  of  credit  losses  over  the  remaining
contractual term  of the  loans, adjusted  for expected  prepayments, in  accordance with  Accounting Standards  Codification (“ASC”)
Topic  326.  An  ACL  is  recognized  for  all  loans  including  originated  and  purchased loans,  since  inception,  with  a  corresponding
charge  to  the  provision  for  credit  losses,  except  for  purchased  credit  deteriorated  (“PCD”)  loans  as  explained  below.  The
Corporation follows a methodology to establish the ACL which includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period for estimating
credit  losses,  considering  quantitative  and  qualitative  factors  as  well  as  the  economic  outlook.  As  part  of  this  methodology,
management evaluates various macroeconomic scenarios provided  by third  parties. At  December 31,  2023, management  applied
probability weights to the outcome of the selected scenarios.

The  Corporation  has  designated  as  collateral  dependent  loans  secured  by  collateral  when  foreclosure  is  probable  or  when
foreclosure is not probable but  the practical expedient  is used. The practical expedient  is used when repayment is  expected to be
provided substantially by the sale or  operation of the collateral and the  borrower is  experiencing financial  difficulty.  The  ACL of
collateral dependent loans is measured based  on the fair value of the  collateral less costs to sell. The  fair value of  the collateral is

61

 
based on appraisals, which may be adjusted due to their age, and the type, location, and condition of the property or area or general
market conditions to reflect the expected change in value between the effective date of the appraisal and the measurement date.  In
addition, refer  to the  Credit Risk  section of  this MD&A  for detailed  information on  the Corporation’s  collateral value  estimation for
other real estate.

Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality 

PCD loans are defined as those with evidence of a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. PCD loans
are initially recorded  at its purchase  price plus an  estimated ACL. Upon the acquisition of  a PCD loan,  the Corporation recognizes
the  estimate  of  the  expected  credit  losses  over  the  remaining  contractual  term  of  each  individual  loan  as  an  ACL  with  a
corresponding addition to the loan purchase price. The amount of the purchased premium or discount which is not related to  credit
risk  is  amortized  over  the  life  of  the  loan  through  net  interest  income  using  the  effective  interest  method  or  a  method  that
approximates the effective interest method. Changes in expected credit losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the ACL
with a corresponding charge  (reverse) to the provision for credit losses in  the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These loans
follow the same nonaccrual policies as non-PCD loans.

Income Taxes

Income  taxes  are  accounted for using  the  asset  and  liability method.  Under  this  method,  deferred tax  assets  and  liabilities  are
recognized based  on the  future tax  consequences attributable  to temporary  differences between the  financial statement  carrying
amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  respective  tax  basis,  and  attributable  to  operating  loss  and  tax  credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  using enacted tax rates  expected to apply in  the years in which the
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. 

The  calculation  of  periodic  income  taxes  is  complex  and  requires  the  use  of  estimates  and  judgments.  The  Corporation  has
recorded  two  accruals  for  income  taxes:  (i)  the  net  estimated  amount  currently  due  or  to  be  received  from  taxing  jurisdictions,
including  any  reserve  for  potential  examination  issues,  and  (ii)  a  deferred  income  tax  that  represents  the  estimated  impact  of
temporary  differences  between  how  the  Corporation  recognizes  assets  and  liabilities  under  GAAP,  and  how  such  assets  and
liabilities are recognized under the  tax code. Differences  in the actual outcome of  these future tax  consequences could impact  the
Corporation’s financial position or its results  of operations. In estimating taxes, management assesses the  relative merits and  risks
of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance. 

A deferred  tax asset should be  reduced by a valuation allowance if based  on the  weight of all available evidence,  it is  more likely
than  not  (a  likelihood  of  more  than  50%)  that  some  portion  or  the  entire  deferred  tax  asset  will  not  be  realized.  The  valuation
allowance  should  be  sufficient  to  reduce  the  deferred  tax  asset  to  the  amount  that  is  more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized.  The
determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is  based on weighting all available evidence, including both positive and
negative evidence.  The realization  of deferred  tax assets,  including carryforwards  and deductible  temporary differences,  depends
upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The realization of
deferred tax assets requires the consideration of all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including
the  future  reversal  of  existing  temporary  differences,  future  taxable  income  exclusive  of  reversing  temporary  differences  and
carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies.

Management evaluates the  realization of the  deferred tax asset  by taxing jurisdiction.  The U.S. mainland operations are evaluated
as  a whole  since a  consolidated income  tax return  is filed;  on the  other hand, the  deferred tax  asset related  to the  Puerto Rico
operations is evaluated  on an  entity by  entity basis,  since no consolidation  is allowed in  the income  tax filing.  Accordingly,  this
evaluation  is  composed  of  three  major  components:  U.S.  mainland  operations,  Puerto  Rico  banking  operations  and  Holding
Company.

For the  evaluation of the realization  of the  deferred tax  asset by  taxing jurisdiction,  refer to  Note 35  to the  Consolidated Financial
Statements.

62

Under the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are
not entitled to file  consolidated tax returns. The Code  provides a dividends-received deduction of 100%  on dividends received from
“controlled” subsidiaries subject to taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations. 

Changes in the Corporation’s estimates can occur  due to changes  in tax  rates, new business  strategies, newly enacted guidance,
and resolution  of issues  with taxing  authorities regarding  previously taken tax  positions. Such changes could  affect the  amount of
accrued taxes. The Corporation has made  tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules. Any remaining payment
will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources.

The valuation  of deferred  tax assets  requires judgment  in assessing  the likely  future tax  consequences of  events that  have been
recognized  in  the  financial  statements  or  tax  returns  and  future  profitability.  The  accounting  for  deferred  tax  consequences
represents management’s best estimate of those future events. Changes in management’s current estimates, due to unanticipated
events, could have a material impact on the Corporation’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite its assessment that the tax
return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, the Corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax
benefit of certain  positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position,  the Corporation determines  whether it is  more likely than  not
that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical  merits  of  the  position.  The  Corporation’s  estimate  of  the  ultimate  tax  liability  contains  assumptions  based  on  past
experiences, and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions  as well as  judgments about the likely outcome of issues
that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax  position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  The Corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each  quarter and adjusts
the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the  progress of a tax audit or the expiration
of a  statute of  limitations. The Corporation  believes the  estimates and assumptions  used to support its  evaluation of uncertain tax
positions are reasonable.

The amount of  unrecognized tax benefits may increase or  decrease in the  future for various  reasons including adding amounts  for
current  tax  year  positions,  expiration  of  open  income  tax  returns  due  to  the  statutes  of  limitation,  changes  in  management’s
judgment about  the level  of uncertainty,  status of  examinations, litigation  and legislative  activity and  the addition  or elimination  of
uncertain tax  positions. Although  the outcome of  tax audits  is uncertain,  the Corporation  believes that  adequate amounts  of tax,
interest and penalties  have been provided for any adjustments  that are expected to result from  open years. From time to time,  the
Corporation is audited by various federal, state  and local authorities regarding  income tax matters. Although  management believes
its  approach in  determining the  appropriate tax  treatment is  supportable and  in  accordance with the  accounting standards,  it  is
possible that the final tax authority will take a tax position that  is different than the tax position reflected in the Corporation’s income
tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any,  are appropriately recorded in the consolidated
financial  statement  in  the  period  determined.  Such  differences  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  Corporation’s  income  tax
provision or  benefit, or  other tax  reserves, in  the reporting  period in  which such  determination is made and,  consequently,  on the
Corporation’s results of operations, financial position and / or cash flows for such period.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The  Corporation’s  goodwill  and  other  identifiable  intangible  assets  having  an  indefinite  useful  life  are  tested  for  impairment.
Intangibles  with  indefinite  lives  are  evaluated  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  and  on  a  more  frequent  basis,  if  events  or
circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place. Such events could include, among others, a  significant adverse change
in the business climate, an adverse action by a regulator,  an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to
change  the  operations  or  dispose  of  a  reporting  unit.  Other  identifiable  intangible  assets  with  a  finite  useful  life  are  evaluated
periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

Goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up to the amount of
the  goodwill.  The  Corporation estimates  the  fair  value  of  each  reporting unit,  consistent  with  the  requirements of the  fair  value
measurements  accounting standard,  generally  using  a  combination  of  methods,  including  market  price  multiples  of  comparable
companies and  transactions, as well as  discounted cash flow analyses.  Subsequent reversal  of goodwill  impairment losses is not
permitted under applicable accounting standards. For a detailed description of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed
by the Corporation during the third quarter of 2023, refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

The Corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans for certain employees of various subsidiaries. The Corporation also
provides certain health care benefits for  retired employees of  BPPR. The non-contributory defined pension  and benefit  restoration
plans (“the Pension Plans”) are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals. 

The estimated benefit costs and obligations of the Pension Plans and  Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan  (“OPEB Plan”) are
impacted by  the use  of subjective  assumptions, which can  materially affect  recorded amounts, including  expected returns on  plan
assets,  discount  rates,  termination  rates,  retirement  rates  and  health  care  trend  rates.  Management  applies  judgment  in  the
determination of these factors, which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the actual experience of the
Corporation.  The  Corporation uses  an  independent  actuarial  firm  for  assistance  in  the  determination of  the  Pension  Plans  and
OPEB Plan costs and obligations. Detailed information  on the Plans  and related valuation  assumptions are included  in Note 30 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the long-term expected return on Pension Plans  assets. The Pension Plans’
assets  fair  value  at  December 31,  2023  was  $652.4  million.  The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  is  determined  by  considering
various factors, including a total fund return estimate based on a weighted-average of estimated returns for each asset class in each
plan.  Asset  class  returns  are  estimated using  current  and  projected  economic  and  market  factors  such  as  real  rates  of  return,
inflation, credit spreads, equity risk premiums and excess return expectations. 

As part of the review,  the Corporation’s independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each
plan’s expected asset  allocation for the year  2024 using the  Willis Towers  Watson US Expected  Return Estimator. This analysis is
reviewed by the Corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return, together with other data. This forecast reflects
the actuarial firm’s view of expected long-term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator as of January 1,
2024; for example, 8.5%  for large cap stocks, 8.8% for  small cap  stocks, 9.0% for  international stocks,  6.0% for  long corporate
bonds  and  5.0%  for  long  Treasury  bonds.  A  range  of  expected investment returns  is  developed, and  this  range  relies  both  on
forecasts and on broad-market historical benchmarks for expected returns, correlations, and volatilities for each asset class. 

As a consequence of recent reviews, the Corporation updated its expected return on plan assets for year 2024 to 5.6% and 6.6% for
the Pension Plans. Expected rates of return of 5.9% and 6.5% had been used for 2023 and 4.3% and 5.4% had been used for 2022
for the Pension  Plans. Since  the expected  return assumption  is on a  long-term basis,  it is  not materially  impacted by  the yearly
fluctuations (either positive or negative) in the actual return on assets. The expected return can be materially  impacted by a change
in the plan’s asset allocation.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost (“pension expense”) for the Pension Plans amounted to $18.6 million in  2023. The total pension expense
included a benefit of $34.4 million for the expected return on assets. 

Pension expense is sensitive to changes in the  expected return on assets. For example, decreasing the expected  rate of return for
2024 from  5.6% to  5.35% would  increase the  projected 2024  pension expense  for the  Banco Popular  de Puerto  Rico Retirement
Plan, the Corporation’s largest plan, by approximately $1.5 million. 

If  the  projected  benefit  obligation  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  plan  assets,  the  Corporation shall  recognize  a  liability  equal  to  the
unfunded projected  benefit obligation  and vice  versa, if  the fair  value of  plan assets  exceeds the  projected benefit  obligation, the
Corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation. This asset or liability may result in a taxable or
deductible temporary difference and its  tax effect shall be  recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall  be allocated
to various components of the financial statements, including other comprehensive income (loss).  The determination of the fair value
of pension plan  obligations involves  judgment, and  any changes  in those  estimates could  impact the  Corporation’s Consolidated
Statements of Financial  Condition. Management believes that  the fair value  estimates of the  Pension Plans assets  are reasonable
given  the  valuation  methodologies  used  to  measure  the  investments  at  fair  value  as  described in  Note  28  to  the  Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  Also,  the  compositions  of  the  plan  assets  are  primarily  in  equity  and  debt  securities,  which  have  readily
determinable quoted market prices. The Corporation had recorded a pension asset of $16.6 million at December 31, 2023.

The Corporation uses  the spot rate  yield curve from  the Willis Towers  Watson RATE:  Link (10/90) Model to discount the  expected
projected  cash  flows  of  the  plans.  The  equivalent  single  weighted  average  discount  rate  ranged  from  5.02%  to  5.05%  for  the
Pension Plans and 5.10% for the OPEB Plan to determine the benefit obligations at December 31, 2023.

64

A 50  basis point  decrease to each of  the rates  in the  December 31,  2023 Willis Towers  Watson RATE:  Link (10/90) Model would
increase the  projected 2024  expense for  the Banco  Popular de  Puerto Rico  Retirement Plan  by approximately  $2.2 million. The
change would not affect the minimum required contribution to the Pension Plans. 

The OPEB Plan was unfunded (no assets were held by the plan) at December 31, 2023. The Corporation had recorded a liability for
the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of $117.0 million at December 31, 2023.

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned from loans, debt securities and money market investments, including loan fees, minus the
interest cost of deposits and borrowed money.  Various risk factors affect net interest income including the economic environment in
which we operate, market related events, the mix and size of the earning assets and related funding, changes in volumes, repricing
characteristics, loan fees  collected, delay charges and interest collected on  nonaccrual loans, as  well as strategic decisions made
by the Corporation’s management.

Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.1 billion or $35.8 million lower than in 2022. Net interest income,
on a taxable equivalent basis, for the year ended December 31,  2023 was $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in 2022, a decrease
of $154.4 million.

The average key index rates for the years 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

Average  outstanding securities  balances are  based upon  amortized cost  excluding any  unrealized gains  or losses  on securities.
Non-accrual  loans  have  been  included  in  the  respective  average  loans  and  leases  categories.  Loan  fees  collected,  and  costs
incurred  in  the  origination  of  loans  are  deferred  and  amortized  over  the  term  of  the  loan  as  an  adjustment  to  interest  yield.
Prepayment penalties, late fees  collected and the amortization of premiums /  discounts on purchased loans, including the discount
accretion on purchased credit  deteriorated loans (“PCD”), are also included as part of the  loan yield. Interest income  for the period
ended December  31, 2023,  included $21.0  million related  to those  items, compared  to $44.6  million for  the same  period in  2022.
The year over year decrease is related to lower amortized fees resulting from the forgiveness of PPP loans by $16.6 million, lower
discount amortization on commercial  loans by $5.4 million mainly driven by  lower interest from cancellation  of PCD loans and $3.7
million lower amortization of the fair value discount of the auto portfolios acquired in previous years. 

Table  3 presents the  different  components of  the  Corporation’s  net  interest  income,  on  a  taxable equivalent  basis,  for  the  year
ended December 31,  2023, as compared  with the same  period in 2022,  segregated by major  categories of interest  earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin was 3.13% in 2023 or 2 basis points higher than the 3.11 % reported in 2022. The
higher net interest margin for  the year is driven by  a full year impact, on deposit costs, of the  increase, in 2022, of 425  basis points
in  the  Federal  Funds  Rate  and  an  additional  100  basis  points  in  2023.  On  a  taxable  equivalent  basis,  net  interest  margin
was 3.31% in 2023, compared to  3.46% in  2022, a  decrease of  15 basis  points. The  main drivers  for the  decrease in  net interest
income on a taxable equivalent basis were:

Negative variances:

● Lower interest income from investment securities by  $48.5 million due to  lower volume by $1.8 billion and lower yield by

three basis points;

● Higher interest  expense on  deposits by  $797.2 million  due to  an increase  in interest  cost by 170  basis points resulting

mainly from  the higher  cost of  the Puerto  Rico government  deposits and  the increase  in cost  of Popular  U.S. deposits.
Under the  terms of  BPPR’s deposit  pricing agreement  with the  Puerto Rico  public sector,  public funds  rates are  market
linked with a lag minus a specified spread. This source of funding still results in an attractive spread under market rates.

Partially offset by:

66

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
● Higher interest income from money market investments by $248.5 million due to  higher interest rates by 396 basis points,

driven by the higher interest  rate environment, as explained above, partially offset by lower volume by  $2.5 billion, due to
lower volume of deposits and loan growth funding;

● Higher interest income from loans by $462.5 million due to:

● Increase in commercial loan Interest income by $284.1 million, or 109 basis points as the origination of loans

occurs  in  a  higher  interest  rate  scenario  and  the  positive  impact  on  the  repricing  of  adjustable-rate  loans,
partially offset by  lower amortized fees resulting from the forgiveness  of PPP loans by $16.6 million and lower
discount amortization on commercial loans by $5.4 million mainly from cancellation of PCD loans,

● Higher interest  income from  construction loans  by $23.4  million, mainly  at Popular  Bank, driven  by  higher

yield by 257 basis points and a higher average volume of loans by $38 million,

● Higher interest income  from auto and  lease financing portfolios  by $40.2 million  driven by higher volume by

$175 million in the leasing portfolio and higher yields by 37 basis points in auto loans, the later increase in yield
was negatively impacted by lower amortization of the fair value discount of the auto loan portfolios  acquired in
previous years, 
●  Higher interest income from mortgage loans by $23.9 million driven by higher yield by 21 basis points and a
higher average volume by $160 million, 
●  Higher interest income from consumer  loans by $91.0 million resulting from a higher volume  by $372 million
and higher  yield by  153 basis  points, driven  by the  increase, mainly in P.R.  in personal  loans year  over year
and an increase in credit cards volume.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio and Unfunded Commitments

For the  year ended December 31, 2023,  the Corporation recorded an expense  of $209.7 million  for its  allowance for credit  losses
(“ACL”) related to loans held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments, compared with an expense of $84.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. The provision expense related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the year  2023 was $201.5 million, compared to
an expense  of $83.3 million for  the year  2022. The  increase in provision expense was  driven by  higher reserves in our  consumer
and commercial portfolios mostly due to changes in credit quality and higher loan volumes. The provision for unfunded commitments
for the year 2023 reflected an expense of $8.2 million, compared to an expense of $0.9 million for the same period of 2022. 

The provision expense related to loans held-in-portfolio for the BPPR segment was $194.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2023, compared to  an expense of $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an unfavorable variance of $125.3 million.
The provision expense related to loans held-in-portfolio for the Popular U.S. segment was $6.7 million for the year 2023, a favorable
variance of $7.1 million, compared to an expense of $13.8 million for the year 2022. As part of the Corporation’s model  governance
procedures, a new model was implemented for the U.S commercial real estate segment. The new model enhances techniques used
to  capture  default  activity  within  the  Corporation’s  geographical  footprint.  As  part  of  the  implementation  analysis,  management
evaluated the credit  metrics of the portfolio such  as  risk ratings, delinquency levels,  and low  exposure to  the commercial office
sector. Qualitative reserves continue  to be  maintained to address risks within the  U. S. commercial real estate  segment. The new
model, including qualitative reserve, resulted in a $7.3 million reduction of PB’s ACL.

At  December 31, 2023, the total allowance for credit  losses for loans held-in-portfolio amounted  to $729.3 million, compared to
$720.3  million  as  of  December  31,  2022.  The  ratio  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  to  loans  held-in-portfolio  was  2.08%  at
December 31, 2023, compared  to 2.25% at December 31,  2022. Refer  to Note 9 to the  Consolidated Financial  Statements, for
additional information on the Corporation’s methodology to estimate its ACL. As discussed therein, within the process to estimate its
ACL, the Corporation applies probability weights to the outcomes of simulations using Moody’s Analytics’ Baseline, S3 (pessimistic)
and S1 (optimistic) scenarios.  The baseline  scenario is  assigned the  highest probability,  followed by the  pessimistic scenario.  In
addition,  refer  to  the  Credit  Risk  section  of  this  MD&A  for  a  detailed  analysis  of  net  charge-offs,  non-performing  assets,  the
allowance for credit losses and selected loan losses statistics.

Provision for Credit Losses – Investment Securities

The  Corporation’s  provision  for  credit  losses  related  to  its  investment  securities  held-to-maturity  is  related  to  the  portfolio  of
obligations from  the  Government of Puerto  Rico,  states  and  political subdivisions. For  the year  ended December 31,  2023, the
Corporation recorded a reserve release of $1.1 million, compared to a reserve release of $1.2 million for the  year ended December
31, 2022. At  December 31, 2023, the total allowance for credit losses  for this portfolio  amounted to $5.8 million, compared to  $6.9
million as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the ACL for
this portfolio.

Non-Interest Income

For the year  ended December 31, 2023,  non-interest income decreased by $246.3 million, when compared with the previous year.
Factors that contributed to the variance in non-interest income were:

● 

● 

● 

lower other operating income by $270.3 million mainly due to  a $257.7 million gain  recognized during the year  2022 due
to the Evertec Transactions and related accounting adjustments;

lower income from mortgage banking activities by $21.0 million due to the unfavorable variances of $11.8 million and $3.5
million in the  fair value  adjustments for  mortgage servicing  rights and  mortgage servicing fees,  respectively,  driven by
serviced  loan  portfolio  runoff  due  to  the  Corporation's  determination  in  the  third  quarter  of  2022  to  retain  certain
guaranteed loans as held for investment, and lower gains from closed derivative positions by $6.0 million; and

lower  service  charges  on  deposit  accounts  by  $9.7  million  due  to  lower  overdraft  related  charges,  in  part  due  to  the
Corporation’s determination to eliminate insufficient funds fees and modifying overdraft fees effective in the third quarter of
2022;

69

partially offset by: 

● 

higher  other  service  fees  by  $40.4  million,  principally  at  the  BPPR  segment,  due  to  higher  credit  card  fees  by  $16.0
million, mainly due to higher customer purchase activity, higher other fees by $11.1 million, mainly due to higher fees from
the merchant network business by  $8.3 million due to the revenue sharing agreement entered into in connection with the
Evertec  Transactions,  higher debit card fees  by  $4.1 million, mainly  due  to  higher volume  of transactions, and  higher
insurance fees by $3.8 million; and

● 

favorable  variance  of  $10.8  million  on  the  fair  value  adjustments to  the  portfolio  of  equity securities mainly  related  to
deferred benefit plans, which have an offsetting effect recorded as higher personnel costs.

Operating Expenses

As discussed  in the  significant events  section of  this MD&A,  to facilitate  the transparency  of the  progress with  the transformation
initiative and  to better  portray the  level of  technology related  expenses categorized  by the  nature of  the expense,  effective in  the
fourth  quarter  of  2022,  the  Corporation  has  separated  technology,  professional  fees  and  transactional  activities  as  standalone
expense categories  in the  accompanying Consolidated  Statements of  Operations. There  were no  changes to  the total  operating
expenses presented.  Prior periods amount in the financial statements and related disclosures have been reclassified to conform  to
the current presentation.

Operating expenses  for the  year ended  December 31,  2023 totaled  $1.9 billion,  which included  $71.4 million  related to  the FDIC
Special Assessment, an increase of $151.7 million when compared with the previous year. Excluding the effect of the FDIC Special
Assessment, total expenses for 2023 were $1.8  billion, an increase of $80.2 million, when compared with the previous year.  During
the  year  2023,  the  Corporation  incurred  approximately  $21.5  million  in  transformation  related  costs,  compared  to  $24.6  million
incurred during the second half of the year 2022. The other variances in operating expenses for the year were driven primarily by:

● 

higher  personnel costs  by  $58.3 million  mainly  due  to  higher salaries  expense by  $73.0  million  as  a  result  of  market
adjustments,  annual  salary  revisions  and  an  increase  in  headcount,  an  increase  in  health  insurance  costs  by  $11.7
million, higher payroll taxes and other compensation expenses by $17.1 million; partially offset by a decrease in incentive
compensation and profit-sharing accrual by $45.3 million;

● 

● 

● 

● 

● 

a higher goodwill impairment expense by $14.0 million, related to  our U.S. based leasing subsidiary for which a charge of
$23 million was  recorded in 2023,  due to lower  forecasted cash flows  and an increase  in the rate  used to discount  cash
flows, compared to an impairment of $9 million recorded in 2022 as a result of a decrease in the projected earnings.

higher other processing and transactional services expenses by $11.8 million mainly due to broad based retail customers'
debit card replacement costs incurred during the second quarter of 2023, the impact of $3.5 million of incentives received
during  July  2022  related  to  the  ATH  Network  Participation  Agreement  entered  into  in  connection  with  the  Evertec
Business Acquisition and an increase by $2.6 million in service charges related to point of sale debit card transactions;

higher customer reward program expense  in our credit card business by $7.3 million, reflecting an increase in customer
purchase activity;

higher net occupancy expense by $5.4 million mainly due to an increase in buildings’ insurance premiums and higher rent
expense related to the space occupied by Popular Bank; and

lower  other  real  estate  owned  (OREO)  income  by  $6.8  million  mainly  due  to  lower  gain  on  sale  of  mortgage  and
commercial properties; 

These variances were partially offset by:

● 

● 

● 

lower other  operating expenses  by  $12.2 million  mainly  due to  the effect  of prior year  expense related  to the Evertec
Transactions of  $17.3 million,  lower sundry  losses by  $8.5 million,  mainly related  to mortgage  claim reserves,  and $2.2
million of  impairment of  long-lived assets  recognized during  2022; partially  offset by  higher pension  plan cost  by $19.2
million due to changes in actuarial assumption.

lower professional  fees by  $10.9 million  mainly due  to lower  legal fees  by $2.7  million and  lower advisory  expenses by
$6.8 million from various Corporate projects, including the Corporation’s transformation initiative, for which certain projects
are being managed with internal personnel; and

lower  other  taxes  expense  by  $7.7  million  mainly  due  to  the  reversal  during  2023  of  an  accrual  related  to  regulatory
examination fees in BPPR.

Income Taxes

For the  year ended  December 31,  2023, the  Corporation recorded an  income tax  expense of  $134.2 million, compared to  $132.3
million for the  same period of  2022.  The net increase  of $1.9 million  in income tax  expense reflects the impact  of the composition
and source  of taxable  income between  both years.  For the  year 2023,  the income  before tax  was lower  than year  2022, which
would have resulted in a lower income tax expense; however, the income tax expense of year 2022 benefited from the reversal of a
portion of the deferred tax  assets valuation  allowance of  the U. S. operations, which resulted  in an income  tax  benefit of  $68.2
million, the sale of Evertec shares, taxable at a preferential rate, and a higher tax exempt income net of disallowance.

At December 31, 2023, the Corporation had a  net deferred tax asset  amounting to $1 billion, net of a valuation  allowance of $0.5
billion.  The net deferred tax asset related to the U. S. operations was $0.3 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion.

Refer to  Note 35  to the  Consolidated Financial Statements for  a reconciliation of the  statutory income  tax rate  to the  effective tax
rate and additional information on the income tax expense and deferred tax asset balances.

Fourth Quarter Results

The Corporation recognized net  income of $94.6 million  for the quarter  ended December 31, 2023,  compared with a net income of
$257.1 million for the same quarter of 2022.

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 amounted to $534.1 million, compared with $559.6 million for the fourth quarter of
2022, a decrease of $25.4 million. The  decrease in net interest income was mainly due to higher cost on deposits partially offset by
an increase  in interest  income from  loans, mainly  due to  growth at  both BPPR  and PB  and higher  rates, and  higher income  from

72

money market investments due to higher average balances and higher rates. The net interest margin decreased by 20  basis points
to 3.08% mainly due to an increase in deposit costs, particularly on Puerto Rico public funds and time deposits at PB. On a taxable
equivalent basis, the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 3.26%, compared to 3.64% for the fourth quarter of 2022.

The provision for credit losses was $78.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a provision expense of $49.5 million for
the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in provision expense reflects portfolio growth and changes in credit quality. 

Non-interest income  amounted to  $168.7 million  for the  quarter ended  December 31,  2023, compared  with $158.5  million for  the
same quarter in 2022. The increase of $10.3 million was mainly due to higher other  service fees by $7.7  million and higher service
charges on deposit accounts by $3.0 million mainly due to higher non-balance compensation.

Operating expenses  totaled $531.1  million for  the quarter  ended December  31, 2023,  compared with  $461.7 million  for the  same
quarter  in  the  previous  year.  The  increase  of  $69.4  million  is  mainly  related  to  the  $71.4  million  FDIC  Special  Assessment
recognized during  the fourth  quarter of  2023; partially  offset by  lower professional  fees by  $10.1 million  mainly related  to various
corporate projects, including the transformation initiative, for which certain areas are currently being managed by internal personnel.

For  the  quarter  ended  December  31,  2023,  the  Corporation  recorded  an  income  tax  benefit  of  $1.5  million,  compared  with  an
income tax  benefit of  $50.3 million for the  same quarter  of 2022.  The unfavorable variance of  $48.9 million in  income tax  benefit,
when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022,  was mostly attributed to the reversal of a  portion of the deferred tax  assets valuation
allowance during the fourth  quarter of 2022, for  which we reported an  income tax benefit of $68.2 million. During  the fourth quarter
of 2023, we reported a lower income before tax,  mainly due to the FDIC  Special Assessment, which resulted in a lower income tax
expense by approximately $42.6 million.  We also  recorded lower exempt  income and other  lower tax benefits,  both increasing the
income tax expense by $15.5 million and 7.2 million, respectively.

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS

The Corporation’s  reportable segments  for managerial  reporting purposes  consist of  Banco Popular  de Puerto  Rico and  Popular
U.S. A Corporate group has been defined to support the reportable segments. 

For  a  description  of  the  Corporation’s  reportable  segments,  including  additional  financial  information  and  the  underlying
management accounting process, refer to Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Corporate group reported a net income of $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with a net income of
$150.1  million  for  the  previous year.  The  decrease  in  net  income  was  mainly  attributed to  the  $128.8 million  in  after-tax  gains
recognized by the Corporation as a result of the Evertec Stock Sale, as defined in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
and related accounting adjustments during the year ended September 30,2022.

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable segments are discussed below:

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 

The Banco Popular  de Puerto Rico reportable  segment’s net income  amounted to $472.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2023, compared with $782.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in
the financial results included the following: 

● 

Lower net  interest income  by $11.9  million due  to higher  interest expense  on deposits  by $616.0  million mainly  due to
higher costs on the market-indexed Puerto Rico government deposits, and  the higher interest rate environment’s  impact
on the cost  of NOW accounts,  time deposits and  savings deposits; partially  offset by higher interest income  from money
market  and  investment securities  by  $287.5 million mainly  due to higher yields  driven by  the increase in  rates by  the
Federal  Reserve  and  higher  average  balances  of  U.S.  Treasury  securities;  and  higher  interest  income from  loans  by
$317.4 million, mainly due to higher average balances mainly in commercial and consumer loans and higher yields across

A  provision  for  loan  losses  of  $194.3  million  in  2023,  compared  to  $70.3  million  for  the  year  ended  2022,  or  an
unfavorable variance of $124.0 million, due in part to loan growth; 

● 

Lower non-interest income by $93.6 million mainly due to:

● 

● 

Lower  other  operating  income  by  $109.3  million  mostly  due  to  the  gain  recorded  as  result  of  the  Evertec
Transactions and related accounting adjustments on 2022, 

Lower mortgage banking activities by $20.4 million, unfavorable variances in the fair value  adjustments for mortgage
serving  rights  and  mortgage  servicing  fees,  driven  by  serviced  loan  portfolio  runoff  due  to  Corporation’s
determination in the third  quarter of 2022 to  retain certain guaranteed loans as held for investment, and lower gains
from closed derivative positions;

● 

Lower  service  charges  on  deposit accounts  by  $8.8  million  principally due  to  the  change  in  policy of  eliminating
insufficient fund fees and modifying overdraft fees implemented in the third quarter of 2022. 

● 

Higher operating expenses by $111.5 million, mainly due to: 

● 

● 

● 

● 

● 

Higher  personnel  costs  by  $37.0  million  due  to  a  higher  headcount  and  salaries  adjustments,  including  merit
increases, market  and minimum salary adjustments  and higher  pension and  health insurance costs; partially  offset
by a decrease in profit sharing in incentive compensation; 

Higher  business  promotions  by  $6.1  million  mainly  due  to  higher  customer  rewards  expense  related  to  higher
transactional volumes;

Higher FDIC deposit insurance expense by $68.8 million due to the FDIC Special Assessment recorded in 2023;

Higher processing and transactional services by $10.8 million mainly due to higher credit and debit card processing
expense as a result of higher transactional volumes,

recorded in 2022  and lower charges  allocated from the  Corporate segment group by $9.1 million  mainly from lower
personnel costs; partially offset by higher pension plan cost by $19.2 million due to charges in actuarial assumptions;

Lower technology and software expenses by $4.5 million  mainly due in part  to savings associated with the  acquired
services from Evertec during 2022; 

Lower net  recoveries from OREO by  $7.4 million mainly  due to  lower gain  on  sale  of mortgage and commercial
properties.

For the  year ended  December 31, 2023,  the reportable  segment of  Popular U.S.  reported net  income of  $56.3 million,  compared
with a net  income of $170.3 million for  the year ended December  31, 2022. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in
the financial results included the following: 

● 

● 

● 

Lower net interest income by $22.3 million mainly due to higher interest expense on deposits by $207.3 million mainly due
to higher  rates and  higher average balance of  time deposit  primarily gathered through  its direct  online channel,  partially
offset by  higher interest  income from  loans by  $138.1 million,  mainly from  growth in  the commercial portfolio as  well as
higher yields due to increases in rates, and higher income from money market and investment securities by $47.4 million
due to higher  yields and higher  average balance. The  Popular U.S. reportable segment’s  net interest margin  was 2.98%
for 2023 compared with 3.68% for the same period in 2022; 

An  unfavorable variance  of  $2.1 million  on  the  provision for  loan  losses and  unfunded commitments, reflective of  the
updated macroeconomics  scenarios offset  by the  implementation of  the new  model for  the U.S.  commercial real  estate
loans, which resulted in a reserve release of $14.6 million; 

Lower non-interest  income by $7.1 million mainly  due to  the reversal on  2022 of $9.2 million  of the contingent  liability
related to the acquisition of the commercial lease business at Popular Equipment Finance;

● 

Higher operating expenses by $39.0 million mainly due to: 

● 

● 

● 

● 

● 

Higher personnel costs by $5.9 million due to salary market and annual adjustments;

Higher occupancy expense by  $4.1 million due to  higher rental building and an increase in amortization mainly
due to early termination of contracts;

Higher  FDIC  deposit  insurance  expense  by  $10.0  million  due  to  the  FDIC  Special  Assessment  recorded  in
2023;

Higher other  expenses by $2.9 million  due to  higher charges  allocated from  the Corporate segment  by $1.6
million, mainly professional fees; and

The goodwill impairment charge related  to our U.S. based leasing subsidiary of $23.0 million  recorded in 2023,
due to lower forecast cash flows  and increase in the rate to  discount cash flows, compared to an impairment of
$9.0 million recorded in 2022, an unfavorable variance of $14.0 million. 

● 

Higher income  tax  expense by  $43.4 million  due mainly due to  the partial  reversal of  the deferred tax  asset valuation
allowance recorded during the fourth quarter of 2022 of $68.2 million. 

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 
Assets
The Corporation’s total assets were $70.8 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $67.6 billion  at December 31, 2022. Refer to
the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in this Form 10-K. Also,
refer to the Statistical Summary 2023-2022 in this MD&A for Condensed Statements of Financial Condition. 

Money market investments and debt securities

Money  market  investments  increased by  $1.4  billion  at  December 31,  2023,  when compared  to  December 31,  2022.  This  was
impacted by the increase in  deposits of $2.4 billion,  mainly due to higher Puerto  Rico public sector  deposits  at BPPR and  time
deposit  at  PB.  Debt  securities  available-for-sale  decreased  by  $1.1  billion,  mainly  due  repayments  and  maturities,  while  debt
securities  held-to-maturity  decreased  by  $329.9  million.  Refer  to  Notes  6  and  7  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for
additional information with respect to the Corporation’s debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.

Loans

75

Refer to Table  6 for a breakdown of  the Corporation’s loan portfolio. Also,  refer to Note 8  to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for detailed information about the Corporation’s loan portfolio composition and loan purchases and sales.

Loans  held-in-portfolio increased  by  $3.0 billion to  $35.1 billion at December 31, 2023, mainly due to  growth in  the commercial
portfolio of  $2.0 billion,  reflected at  both BPPR  and PB  by approximately  $1.1 billion  and $0.9  billion, respectively,  and consumer
loans at  BPPR. Consumer loans  at BPPR increased by $445.0 million in  the aggregate including  credit cards, personal loans and
auto loans. The increase in BPPR’s consumer portfolio is aligned with the increase in  retail sales and consumer spending in Puerto
Rico  during  2023.  The  auto  loans  portfolio  at  BPPR  benefited  from  the  sustained  level  of  auto  sales  activity  on  the  island.  In
addition, mortgage  loans increased  by $281.5 million  from the  previous year,  as the  Corporation continued  to retain, in  portfolio,
FHA-guaranteed mortgage loans originations. 

A portion of the Corporation’s $3.0 billion year over year loan growth in 2023 was driven by its non-owner occupied commercial real
estate  and  commercial  multi-family  portfolios,  as  detailed  in  Table  6.  Due  to  market  pressures  from  shifts  to  hybrid  work
environments since  the pandemic,  particularly in  the New  York  Metro area  where the  Corporation operates,  and the  effect of  the
current higher interest rate environment, there has been increased focus about the risks of these categories of loans. 

The Corporation’s  $5.1 billion non-owner occupied commercial  real estate  portfolio is comprised  of $3.0 billion in Puerto Rico  and
$2.1 billion in the U.S. and is well diversified across a number of tenants in different industries and segments with exposure to retail
(35%  of  non-owner occupied  CRE),  hotels  (20%)  and  office  space  (12%)  accounting for  two  thirds  of  the  total  exposure.  The
approximate $639 million office space  exposure represents only 1.8% of the  total loan portfolio and is  comprised mainly of mid-rise
properties with diversified tenants with average loan size of $2 million across both the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

Popular’s $2.4 billion commercial multi-family  portfolio represents approximately 7% of  total loans and is  concentrated in New York
Metro ($1.4 billion), South Florida ($768 million) and Puerto Rico  ($185 million). In the New York Metro  region, the Corporation has
no  exposure  to  rent  controlled  buildings.  The  majority  of  our  multi-family  loans,  in  that  region,  are  collateralized  by  underlying
buildings that count on a mix  of units subject to rent stabilized (subject to annual capped rent increases) and market-rate units. The
rent stabilized units represent less than 40% of the total units in the loan portfolio with the majority originated after 2019. The mix of
units within  a building  is common  across the  New York  Metro region  due to  tax incentives  awarded to  developers based  on rent
stabilized units. In 2024, there  are approximately $237 million in multi-family  loans in our  New York  Metro  portfolio expected  to
reprice.

Refer to  Note 9  to the  Consolidated Financial  Statements for  additional information  on delinquency,  asset quality  and origination
vintage information of these loan segments.

The allowance for credit losses for the  loan portfolio increased by $9.0 million, net of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on
January 1,  2023 (Troubled  Debt Restructuring  by Creditors),  mainly due  to changes  in credit  quality metrics  and portfolio  growth.
Refer to the Credit Quality section of the MD&A for additional information on the Allowance for credit losses for the loan portfolio.

Deposits
The  Corporation’s  deposits  totaled  $63.6  billion  at  December  31,  2023,  compared  to  $61.2  billion  at  December  31,  2022.The
deposits increase of $2.4 billion was mainly  in Puerto Rico public sector deposits at BPPR and time deposits  at PB. Public sector
deposit balances amounted to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $15.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The receipt by
the Puerto Rico  Government of additional  federal assistance, and seasonal tax collections,  could increase public  deposit balances
at BPPR in  the near term.  However, the rate at which  public deposit balances may  decline is uncertain and  difficult to predict.  The
amount  and  timing  of  any  such  reduction  is  likely  to  be  impacted  by,  for  example,  the  speed  at  which  federal  assistance  is
distributed, the financial condition, liquidity and cash management practices of the Puerto Rico Government and its instrumentalities
and the implementation of  fiscal and  debt adjustment plans approved  pursuant to  PROMESA or  other actions  mandated by the
Fiscal Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the “Oversight Board”).

Approximately 28% of the  Corporation’s deposits are public  fund deposits from the  Government of Puerto Rico,  municipalities and
government instrumentalities and corporations (“public funds’’).  These public funds deposits are  indexed to short-term market rates
and fluctuate  in cost  with changes  in those  rates with  a one-quarter  lag, in  accordance with  contractual terms.  As a  result, these
deposits’ costs  have generally  lagged variable  asset repricing.  Generally,  these deposits  require that  the bank  pledge high  credit
quality securities  as collateral;  therefore, liquidity  risks arising  from public  sector deposit  outflows are  lower.  Refer to  the Liquidity
section in this MD&A for additional information on the Corporation’s funding sources.

Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ equity totaled  $5.1 billion at  December 31, 2023,  an increase of  $1.1 billion when  compared to December  31, 2022.
The increase was principally due to lower accumulated unrealized gain/losses on debt securities available-for-sale by $472.5 million
and net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $541.3 million, partially offset by declared dividends of $163.7 million and
$1.4  million  on  common  stock  and  preferred  stock,  respectively.  Refer  to  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Financial  Condition,
Comprehensive Income  and of  Changes in  Stockholders’ Equity  for information  on the  composition of  stockholders’ equity.  Also,

REGULATORY CAPITAL

The Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board. The
risk-based capital standards  applicable to Popular,  Inc. and the  Banks, BPPR and PB, are  based on the  final capital framework  of
Basel III. The  capital rules of Basel III include  a “Common Equity Tier  1” (“CET1”) capital measure and specifies that Tier 1 capital
consist of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1  Capital” instruments meeting specified requirements. Note  21 to the  Consolidated Financial
Statements presents further information on the  Corporation’s regulatory capital requirements,  including the regulatory capital  ratios
of its depository institutions, BPPR and PB.

An institution is considered “well-capitalized”  if it  maintains a total  capital ratio of 10%, a Tier  1 capital ratio  of 8%, a CET1 capital
ratio  of  6.5%  and  a  leverage  ratio  of  5%.  The  Corporation’s  ratios  presented  in  Table 9  show  that  the  Corporation  was  “well
capitalized” for  regulatory purposes,  the highest  classification, under  Basel III  for years  2023 and  2022. BPPR  and PB  were also
well-capitalized for all years presented.

The Basel III Capital Rules also require an additional 2.5% “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these
minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, which excludes the leverage ratio. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses
during periods of  economic stress. Banking institutions with a  ratio of CET1  to risk-weighted assets  above the minimum  but below
the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the
shortfall. Popular,  BPPR and  PB are  required to  maintain this  additional capital  conservation buffer  of 2.5%  of CET1,  resulting in
minimum ratios  of (i) CET1  to risk-weighted  assets of  at least  7%, (ii) Tier  1 capital  to risk-weighted  assets of  at least  8.5%, and
(iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.

On April 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the final rule issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies pursuant to the Economic
Growth and  Regulatory Paperwork  Reduction Act  of 1996  that simplified  several requirements  in the  agencies’ regulatory  capital
rules. These  rules simplified  the regulatory  capital requirement  for mortgage  servicing assets  (MSAs), deferred  tax assets  arising
from temporary differences  and investments in  the capital  of unconsolidated financial  institutions by raising the CET1 deduction
threshold  from  10%  to  25%.  The  15%  CET1  deduction  threshold  which  applies  to  the  aggregate  amount  of  such  items  was
eliminated. The  rule also  requires, among  other changes,  increasing from  100% to  250% the  risk weight  to MSAs  and temporary

difference deferred  tax asset  not deducted  from capital.  For investments  in the  capital of  unconsolidated financial  institutions, the
risk weight would be based on the exposure category of the investment. 

The decrease in the CET1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio and, total capital ratio as of December 31, 2023, compared to December
31,  2022, was  mostly  due  to  an  increase  in  risk  weighted  assets  driven  by  the  growth  in  the  commercial  and  consumer  loan
portfolios, partially offset by the annual earnings. The increase in the leverage capital ratio was mainly due to the increase in  capital
driven by the annual earnings, partially offset by a slight increase in average total assets.

Pursuant  to  the  adoption of  CECL  on  January  1,  2020,  the  Corporation elected  to  use  the  five-year  transition  period  option  as
provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective March 31,2020. The five-year transition period provision delays for two
years the  estimated impact  of CECL on  regulatory capital,  followed by  a three-year  transition period  to phase out  the aggregate
amount of the capital benefits  provided during the  initial two-year delay.  As of December 31, 2023,  the Corporation had  phased-in
50% of the cumulative CECL deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remaining two years. In the first quarter of
2024, the Corporation will phase in a cumulative 75% of the deferral.

On  August  26,  2020,  federal  banking  regulators issued  a  final  rule  to  modify  the  Basel  III  regulatory capital  rules  applicable  to
banking organizations to allow  those organizations participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) established under the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief  and Economic Security  Act (the “CARES Act”) to  neutralize the regulatory  capital effects of participating in
the  program.  Specifically,  the  agencies  have  clarified  that  banking  organizations,  including  the  Corporation  and  its  Bank
subsidiaries, are permitted to  assign a zero percent risk weight to  PPP loans for  purposes of determining risk-weighted assets and
risk-based capital  ratios. Additionally,  in  order to  facilitate  use of the Paycheck Protection  Program Liquidity  Facility  (the “PPPL
Facility”), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation’s Bank subsidiaries to
fund PPP loans, the  agencies further clarified that, for purposes of determining  leverage ratios, a banking  organization is permitted
to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a PPPL Facility. As of December 31, 2023,
the Corporation has $9 million in PPP loans and no loans were pledged as collateral for PPPL Facilities.

Non-GAAP financial measures

The tangible  common equity  ratio and  tangible book  value per  common share,  which are  presented in  the table  that follows,  are
non-GAAP measures.  Management and  many stock  analysts use  the tangible  common equity  ratio and  tangible book  value per
common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with
significant amounts  of goodwill  or other  intangible assets,  typically stemming  from the  use of  the purchase  accounting method  of
accounting  for  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Neither  tangible  common  equity  nor  tangible  assets  or  related  measures  should  be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders’  equity, total assets or any other measure calculated  in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation
calculates its tangible common equity,  tangible assets and  any other related  measures may  differ  from that  of other companies
reporting measures with similar names. 

The decrease  in the  Tangible  common equity to  tangible assets  ratio during  2022 was  mainly related  to the  decrease in  the fair
value of  the Corporation’s fixed rate available for sale  debt securities portfolio and its impact on the unrealized loss component  of

81

 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  (‘’AOCI’’).  Given  its  ability  due  to  the  Corporation’s  liquidity  position  and  its
intention to reduce the impact on AOCI and tangible capital of further increases in interest rates, management changed its intent  to
hold certain securities to maturity.  Therefore, in October 2022, the Corporation transferred U.S. Treasury securities with a fair value
of $6.5 billion (par value of $7.4 billion) from its available-for-sale portfolio to its held-to-maturity portfolio. 

The securities were reclassified  at fair value  at the  time of the transfer.  At the date of  the transfer,  these securities had pre-tax
unrealized  losses  of  $873.0  million  recorded  in  AOCI.  This  fair  value  discount  is  being  accreted  to  interest  income  and  the
unrealized loss remaining in AOCI is being amortized,  offsetting each other through  the remaining life of  the securities. There were
no realized gains or losses recorded as a result of this transfer. 

While changes  in the  amount of  unrealized gains  and losses  in AOCI  have an  impact on  the Corporation’s  and its  wholly-owned
banking  subsidiaries’  tangible  capital  ratios,  they  do  not  impact  regulatory  capital  ratios,  in  accordance  with  the  regulatory
framework.  Refer  to  Note  7  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements  which  presents  information about  the  Corporation’s  Debt
Securities Held-to-Maturity for additional details.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Market / Interest Rate Risk

The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks.

Market risk refers to the  risk of a  reduction in the  Corporation’s capital due  to changes in  the market valuation  of its assets  and/or
liabilities. 

Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk  are debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 to the
Consolidated Financial  Statements for  further information  on the  debt securities available-for-sale  and held-to-maturity portfolios.
Debt securities classified  as available-for-sale amounted to $16.7 billion  as of December  31, 2023. Other  assets subject to  market
risk include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $4 million, mortgage servicing  rights (“MSRs”) which amounted to $118  million,
and securities classified as “trading”, which amounted to $32 million, as of December 31, 2023. 

Interest Rate Risk (“IRR”)

The Corporation’s net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and
option risks.  In managing  interest rate  risk, management may  alter the  mix of  floating and  fixed rate  assets and  liabilities, change
pricing  schedules,  adjust  maturities  through  sales  and  purchases  of  investment  securities,  and  enter  into  derivative  contracts,
among other alternatives. 

Interest  rate  risk  management  is  an  active  process  that  encompasses  monitoring  loan  and  deposit  flows  complemented  by
investment and funding activities. Effective management of  interest rate risk begins  with understanding the dynamic  characteristics
of assets and  liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position  given line of business forecasts, management objectives,
market expectations and policy constraints.

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest Income (“NII”) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and
Economic Value  of Equity  (“EVE”). The  three methodologies  complement each  other and  are used  jointly in  the evaluation  of the
Corporation’s IRR. NII  simulation modeling is prepared for a  five-year period, which  in conjunction with the EVE analysis,  provides
management a better view of long-term IRR.

Net interest income simulation analysis  performed by legal  entity and on  a consolidated basis  is a tool used by the Corporation in
estimating the  potential change  in net  interest income  resulting from  hypothetical changes  in interest  rates. Sensitivity  analysis is
calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs. 

Management assesses  interest rate  risk by  comparing various  NII simulations  under different  interest rate  scenarios that  differ in
direction of interest  rate changes, the  degree of change and the projected shape of the  yield curve. For example, the types of rate
scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates,  implied forwards, and parallel and non-parallel rate shocks. Management
also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures. 

The asset  and liability  management group  performs validation  procedures on  various assumptions  used as  part of  the simulation
analyses as well as validations  of results on a monthly basis. In addition, the  model and processes used to assess IRR are subject
to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the Model Governance and Validation policy.

The Corporation processes NII simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed  to rise and decline by
the same magnitude  (parallel shifts). The rate scenarios considered in  these market risk simulations include instantaneous parallel
changes of -100, -200, +100, and +200 basis points  during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses are based on
many assumptions,  including that  the balance  sheet remains  flat, the  relative levels  of market  interest rates  across all  yield curve
points  and  indexes,  interest  rate  spreads,  loan  prepayments  and  deposit  elasticity.  Thus,  they  should  not  be  relied  upon  as
indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in
interest rates. Additionally, the Corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis
related to  using different  rate indexes  for the  repricing of  assets and  liabilities, as  well as  the effect  of pricing  lags which  may be
contractual or due to  historical differences  in the  timing of management responses  to changes in  the rate  environment. By  their
nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from  what may actually occur in the future. The
following table  presents the  results of  the simulations  at December  31, 2023  and December  31, 2022,  assuming a  static balance
sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

The  results  of  the  NII  simulations  at  December  31,  2022  in  the  table  above  have  been  adjusted  from  those  reported  in  the
Corporation’s 2022 Form 10-K to reflect the effect of changes in certain modeling assumptions in down rate scenario simulations for
certain variable rate loans. Specifically, the yield on certain variable rate loans that did not have contractual periodic floors, were not
repricing according to the terms of those variable rate loans in the down rate simulations.

Although the adjustment referred to in the preceding paragraph results in the magnitude of the Corporation’s sensitivity to decreases
in interest rates becoming lower, as of December 31, 2022, the adjusted NII simulations continued to show that the Corporation had
a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the rapid increase in short-term interest rates throughout 2022.

As of December  31, 2023, NII simulations show the Corporation has a neutral to slightly asset sensitive position as compared to a
slightly  liability  sensitive  position as  of  December  31,  2022.  The  primary  reasons  for  the  variation  in  sensitivity  are  changes  in
balance sheet composition driven by an increase in overnight Fed Funds, short-term U.S Treasury Bills (“T- Bills”) and loan portfolio
on the asset side  partially offset by higher Puerto Rico public sector deposits which are indexed to  market rates and an increase in
time deposits. These  results suggest that changes in the  Corporation’s net interest  income sensitivity are driven  by changes in  the
composition of the investment portfolio as the  term bond portfolio continues  to run off  and get reinvested in short-term investments
such as  T-Bills, combined  with the increase of  approximately $3.0 billion  in loans held in  portfolio. Additionally,  variation in liability
cost, primarily  driven by  Puerto Rico  public sector  deposits that  represented $18.1  billion or  28% of  deposits as  of December  31,
2023,  as  well as  an  increase of approximately $1.7 billion in time  deposits,  also impact the sensitivity  profile. 
In declining rate
scenarios net interest income would slightly increase as the decline in the cost of these deposit generates a greater benefit than the
changes in  assets yields.  In rising  rate scenarios,  Popular’s net  interest income  is also  impacted by  its large  proportion of  Puerto
Rico public sector deposit, however the repricing of assets as they either reset or mature lead to an increase in net interest income.

The Corporation’s  loan and  investment portfolios  are subject  to prepayment risk,  which results  from the  ability of  a third-party  to
repay debt  obligations prior to maturity.  Prepayment risk also could  have a  significant impact on the  duration of  mortgage-backed
securities  and  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  since  prepayments  could  shorten  (or  lower  prepayments  could  extend)  the
weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading 

The Corporation  engages in  trading activities in the  ordinary course of business  at its  subsidiaries, BPPR  and Popular Securities.
Popular Securities’ trading activities consist primarily of market-making activities to meet expected customers’ needs related to  its
retail brokerage business, and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and government sponsored securities with the objective of
realizing gains from expected short-term price  movements. BPPR’s trading activities consist  primarily of  holding U.S. Government
sponsored mortgage-backed securities  classified as  “trading” and  hedging the  related market  risk with  “TBA” (to-be-announced)
market  transactions.  The  objective  is  to  derive  spread  income  from  the  portfolio  and  not  to  benefit  from  short-term  market
movements. In  addition, BPPR  uses forward  contracts or  TBAs to  hedge its  securitization pipeline.  Risks related  to variations  in
interest rates and market volatility  are hedged with TBAs that have characteristics similar to  that of the forecasted security  and its
conversion timeline.

At December 31, 2023, the Corporation held trading securities with a fair value of $32 million, representing approximately 0.05%  of
the Corporation’s total assets, compared with $28 million and 0.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2022. As shown in Table 15, the
trading  portfolio  consists  principally  of  mortgage-backed  securities  and  U.S.  Treasuries,  which  at  December  31,  2023  were
investment grade securities.

The Corporation’s trading activities are  limited by internal policies. For each  of the two subsidiaries, the market risk assumed under
trading  activities  is  measured  by  the  5-day  net  value-at-risk  (“VAR”),  with  a  confidence  level  of  99%.  The  VAR  measures  the
maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. 

The Corporation’s  trading portfolio  had a  5-day VAR  of approximately $0.3 million  for the  last week  in December  31, 2023.  There
are numerous  assumptions and  estimates associated  with VAR  modeling, and  actual results  could differ  from these  assumptions
and estimates. Backtesting is performed  to compare actual results against  maximum estimated losses,  in order to evaluate model
and assumptions accuracy. 

In the opinion of management, the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk
for the Corporation.

Derivatives

Derivatives may  be used by  the Corporation  as  part of its overall interest  rate risk  management strategy  to minimize significant
unexpected  fluctuations  in  earnings  and  cash  flows  that  are  caused  by  interest  rate  volatility.  Derivative  instruments  that  the
Corporation may use  include, among others,  interest rate caps,  indexed options, and  forward contracts. The  Corporation does not
use highly leveraged derivative instruments in its interest rate risk management strategy. Credit risk embedded in these transactions
is  reduced  by  requiring  appropriate  collateral  from  counterparties  and  entering  into  netting  agreements  whenever  possible.  All
outstanding derivatives are  recognized in the  Corporation’s Consolidated Statements  of Condition at  their fair value. Refer to  Note

26 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements for further  information on the  Corporation’s involvement in  derivative instruments and
hedging activities. 

Foreign Exchange

The Corporation holds  an interest in  BHD León in the Dominican Republic, which  is an investment  accounted for under  the equity
method. The Corporation’s carrying value  of the  equity interest in  BHD León approximated $ 225.9 million at  December 31, 2023. 
This business is conducted in  the country’s foreign currency.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment, from operations
for which the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar,  is reported in accumulated  other comprehensive income (loss) in the
consolidated  statements  of  condition,  except  for  highly-inflationary  environments  in  which  the  effects  would  be  included  in  the
consolidated statements  of operations. At  December 31,  2023, the  Corporation had  approximately $  65 million in  an unfavorable
foreign currency translation  adjustment as part  of accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss), compared with an  unfavorable
adjustment of $ 57 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 67 million at December 31, 2021.

The objective  of effective  liquidity management  is to  ensure that  the Corporation  has sufficient  liquidity to  meet all  of its  financial
obligations, finance  expected future  growth, fund planned capital  distributions and  maintain a  reasonable safety  margin for  cash
needs under both normal  and stressed market  conditions. The Board  of Directors  is responsible for establishing the  Corporation’s
tolerance for liquidity risk, including approving relevant risk limits and  policies. The Board of Directors has delegated the monitoring
of these risks  to the Board’s  Risk Management  Committee and  the Asset/Liability  Management Committee.  The management  of
liquidity  risk,  on  a  long-term  and  day-to-day  basis,  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Corporate  Treasury  Division.  The  Corporation’s
Corporate  Treasurer  is  responsible  for  implementing  the  policies  and  procedures  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  for
monitoring the  Corporation’s liquidity position on an  ongoing basis. Also, the  Corporate Treasury  Division coordinates  corporate
wide  liquidity  management  strategies  and  activities  with  the  reportable  segments,  oversees  policy  breaches  and  manages  the
escalation process.  The Financial and  Operational Risk  Management Division  is responsible for  the independent  monitoring and
reporting of adherence with established policies.

An institution’s liquidity  may be  pressured if,  for example,  it experiences  a sudden  and unexpected  substantial cash  outflow due
deposit outflows, whether due  to a loss  of confidence  by depositors, or  other reasons, including  exogenous events  such  as the
COVID-19 pandemic,  a downgrading  of its  credit rating,  or some  other event  that causes  counterparties to  avoid exposure  to the
institution. Factors  that the  Corporation does  not control,  such as the  economic outlook,  adverse ratings  of its  principal markets,
perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. 

The Corporation  has adopted policies and  limits to monitor the  Corporation’s liquidity  position and that of  its banking  subsidiaries.
Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to  model various stress events of different magnitudes and  affecting different time
horizons that assist  management in evaluating  the size of  the liquidity buffers  needed if those  stress events occur. However,  such
models  may  not  predict  accurately  how  the  market  and  customers  might  react  to  every  event,  and  are  dependent  on  many
assumptions.

Deposits, including  customer deposits,  brokered deposits  and public  funds deposits,  continue to  be the  most significant  source of
funds for  the Corporation,  funding  90% of  the Corporation’s  total assets  at December  31, 2023  and 91%  at December  31, 2022. 
The  ratio  of  total  ending  loans  to  deposits  was  55%  at  December 31,  2023  and  52%  at  December  31,  2022. 
In  addition  to
traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding
balances at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $1.4 billion). A detailed description of the Corporation’s borrowings, including
their terms,  is included  in Note  17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also,  the Consolidated Statements  of Cash Flows in
the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the Corporation’s cash inflows and outflows. 

The  following  sections  provide  further  information  on  the  Corporation’s  major  funding  activities  and  needs,  as  well  as  the  risks
involved in these activities.

Bank borrowing capacity

Primary sources of  funding for the  Corporation’s banking subsidiaries  (BPPR and  PB or,  collectively,  “the banking  subsidiaries”)
include  retail,  commercial  and  public  sector  deposits,  brokered  deposits,  unpledged  investment  securities,  mortgage  loan
securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the
discount window  of the  Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  (the “FRB”) and has  a considerable  amount of collateral pledged that
can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 

During the  fourth quarter  of 2023  the Corporation  had no  material incremental  use of  its available  liquidity sources.  At December
31,2023,  the  Corporation’s  available  liquidity  increased  to  $19.5  billion  from  $17.0  billion  on  December  31,  2022.  The  liquidity
sources of the Corporation at December 31,2023 are presented in Table 16:

Refer  to  Note  17  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information  of  the  Corporation’s  borrowing  facilities
available through its banking subsidiaries. 

The principal  uses of  funds for  the banking  subsidiaries include  loan originations,  investment portfolio  purchases, loan  purchases
and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational
expenses. Also, the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral  posting requirements for certain  activities mainly
in  connection  with  contractual  commitments,  recourse  provisions,  servicing  advances,  derivatives  and  credit  card  licensing
agreements. 

The banking  subsidiaries maintain  sufficient funding  capacity to  address large  increases in  funding requirements  such as  deposit
outflows.  The  Corporation has  established liquidity  guidelines that  require  the  banking subsidiaries to  have  sufficient  liquidity  to
cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

The Corporation’s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various
factors, including pricing, service, convenience  and financial stability as reflected by operating results and  financial condition, credit
ratings (by  nationally recognized credit  rating agencies), customer  confidence, and importantly, FDIC deposit insurance coverage.
Deposits at all of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are federally insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate
the potential effect of the aforementioned risks.

Deposits are  a key  source of  funding. Refer to Table  8 for  a breakdown of deposits  by major types. Core  deposits are  generated
from a large base of consumer,  corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include certificate of  deposit under $250,000,
all  interest-bearing  transactional  deposit  accounts,  non-interest  bearing  deposits,  and  savings  deposits.  Core  deposits  exclude
brokered deposits and certificates of  deposit over $250,000. Core deposits, excluding P.R.  public funds that are fully collateralized,
have  historically provided the Corporation with  a sizable source of relatively stable  and  low-cost funds.  P.R.  public funds,  while
linked to  market interest  rates, provide a stable  source of  funding with  an attractive  earnings spread. Core deposits  totaled $59.0
billion, or  93% of  total deposits,  at December 31,  2023, compared  with $57.6  billion, or  94% of  total deposits,  at December  31,
2022. Core deposits financed 88% of the Corporation’s earning assets at December 31, 2023, compared with 90% at December 31,
2022. 

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposit with denominations of $250,000 and over at December 31, 2023 is presented in
the table that follows:

The Corporation had  $1.7 billion in  brokered deposits at  December 31, 2023,  which financed approximately  2% of its  total assets
(December 31, 2022 -  $1.1 billion and 2%,  respectively). In the event that  any of the Corporation’s  banking subsidiaries’ regulatory
capital ratios fall  below those  required by  a well-capitalized  institution or  are subject  to capital  restrictions by  the regulators,  that
banking subsidiary faces  the risk of  not being able  to raise or  maintain brokered deposits  and faces limitations  on the rate  paid on
deposits, which  may hinder  the Corporation’s  ability to  effectively compete  in its  retail markets  and could  affect its  deposit raising
efforts. 

Deposits from the  public sector represent  an important source  of funds for  the Corporation. As  of December 31,  2023, total public
sector deposits were $18.1 billion, compared to $15.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Generally,  these deposits require that the bank
pledge high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector  deposit outflows are lower given
that the bank  receives its collateral in return. This,  now unpledged, collateral can either be  financed via repurchase  agreements or
sold for cash. However, there are some  timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the  bank receives
its  collateral.  Additionally,  the  Corporation  mainly  utilizes  fixed-rate  U.S.  Treasury  debt  securities  as  collateral.  While  these
securities have limited credit risk,  they are subject to market value risk based on  changes in the interest rate  environment.  When
interest  rates  increase,  the  value  of  this  collateral  decreases  and  could  result  in  the  Corporation  having  to  provide  additional
collateral  to  cover  the  same  amount  of  deposit liabilities.  This  additional  collateral  could  reduce  unpledged securities  otherwise
available as liquidity sources to the Corporation. 

At December 31, 2023, management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current  and projected liquidity sources to
meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the  ordinary course of
business and have sufficient  liquidity resources to address a  stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been
able to replace  maturing deposits and advances,  no assurance can be given that  they would be  able to replace  those funds in the
future if the  Corporation’s financial condition or general market conditions were to  deteriorate. The Corporation’s  financial flexibility
will  be severely constrained  if  the banking subsidiaries  are  unable to  maintain access  to funding or  if  adequate financing  is  not
available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit
cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities. To
the extent that the value of securities  previously pledged as collateral declines because of market  changes, the Corporation will  be

90

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
required to deposit additional cash  or securities to  meet its margin requirements, thereby  adversely affecting its  liquidity. Finally, if
management  is  required  to  rely  more  heavily  on  more  expensive  funding  sources  to  meet  its  future growth,  revenues  may  not
increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected.

The Corporation  monitors uninsured  deposits under  applicable FDIC  regulations.  Additionally,  the Corporation  monitors accounts
with balances over $250,000. While the Corporation has a  diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, corporate and government
clients,  as well as  wholesale funding  sources such  as  brokered deposits,  it considers balance in excess of $250,000 to  have a
higher  potential  liquidity  risk.  Table  19  reflects  the  aggregate  balance  in  deposit  accounts  in  excess  of  $250,000,  including
collateralized public funds and deposits outside of the U.S. and its territories.  Collateralized public funds, as presented in Table  19,
represent public  deposit balances  from governmental  entities in  the U.S.  and its  territories, including  Puerto Rico  and the  United
States Virgin Islands, that  are collateralized based on such  jurisdictions’ applicable collateral requirements. On December 31,2023,
deposits with balances in excess of $250,000, excluding foreign deposits (mainly deposits in the British Virgin Islands) intercompany
deposits and collateralized public funds, were $ 10.6 billion or  20% at BPPR and $ 2.6 billion or  23% at Popular U.S., compared to
available liquidity sources of $ 14.5 billion at BPPR and $ 5.0 billion at Popular U.S.

Bank Holding Companies

The principal  sources of  funding for  the BHCs,  which are  Popular,  Inc. (holding company  only) and  PNA, include  cash on  hand,
investment securities, dividends received from  banking and  non-banking subsidiaries,  asset sales,  credit  facilities available from
affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings.  Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries

are subject to various regulatory limits  and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the  ability
of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the BHCs.

The  principal  use  of  these  funds  includes  the  repayment  of  debt,  and  interest  payments  to  holders  of  senior  debt  and  junior
subordinated  deferrable  interest  (related  to  trust  preferred  securities),  the  payment  of  dividends  to  common  stockholders,
repurchases of the Corporation’s securities and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries. 

The  outstanding  balance  of  notes  payable  at  the  BHCs  amounted  to  $592  million  at  December  31,  2023  and  $497  million  at
December 31, 2022.

The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable at December 31, 2023 are presented in Table 20.

As of December  31, 2023,  the BHCs  had cash  and money  markets investments  totaling $388  million and  borrowing potential  of
$222 million from its secured facility with BPPR.  The BHCs’ liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash  on hand,
investments and other sources  of liquidity which are  expected to be enough  to meet all  interest payments and dividend obligations
during the foreseeable future. On March 13,  2023, the Corporation issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior
Notes due  2028 (the  “Notes”) in  an underwritten  public offering.  The Corporation  used a  portion of  the net  proceeds of  the 2028
Notes to  redeem, on August  14, 2023,  the outstanding  $300 million  aggregate principal  amount of  its outstanding  6.125% Senior
Notes  which  were  due  on  September  2023.  Additionally,  the  Corporation’s  latest  quarterly  dividend  was  $0.62  per  share  or
approximately $45 million per quarter.

The BHCs have in the past borrowed in the  corporate debt market primarily to finance their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance
debt obligations. These  sources of funding  are more costly  due to the  fact that two  out of the  three principal credit  rating agencies
rate the Corporation below “investment grade”, which  affects the Corporation’s cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets.
Factors that the Corporation does not control, such  as the economic outlook, interest rate volatility,  inflation, disruptions in the  debt
market, among others,  could also affect  its ability to  obtain funding. The  Corporation has an  automatic shelf registration statement
filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of
debt or equity securities.

Non-Banking Subsidiaries

The  principal  sources  of  funding  for  the  non-banking  subsidiaries include  internally  generated  cash  flows  from  operations,  loan
sales, repurchase agreements, capital injections and borrowed funds  from their direct parent companies or the  holding companies.
The principal uses of funds for the non-banking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, operational expenses and payment
of dividends to the  BHCs. The liquidity needs  of the non-banking subsidiaries  are minimal since most of them are funded internally
from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies. 

Dividends

During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  the  Corporation  declared cash  dividends  of  $2.27  per  common  share  outstanding
($163.7 million in the aggregate). The dividends for the Corporation’s Series A preferred stock amounted to $1.4 million. During the
year ended  December 31,  2023, the  BHCs received  dividends amounting  to $200  million from  BPPR, $50  million from  PNA, $14
million from PIBI  and $8 million from its  non-banking subsidiaries. In  addition, during the  year ended December  31, 2023, Popular
International Bank Inc., wholly owned subsidiary of  Popular, Inc.,  received $14.1 million in  cash dividends and $2.1 million in stock
dividends from its investment in BHD. Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc.’s primary source of liquidity. 

Other Funding Sources and Capital

In addition to cash  reserves held at the FRB that totaled $7.0 billion  at December 31,2023, the debt securities portfolio provides  an
additional  source  of  liquidity,  which  may  be  realized  through  either  securities  sales,  collateralized  borrowings  or  repurchase
agreements.  The  Corporation’s  debt  securities  portfolio  consists  primarily  of  liquid  U.S.  government  debt  securities,  U.S.

92

 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
government  sponsored  agency  debt  securities,  U.S.  government  sponsored  agency  mortgage-backed  securities,  and  U.S.
government  sponsored  agency  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  that  can  be  used  to  raise  funds  in  the  repo  markets.  The
availability  of  the  repurchase  agreement  would  be  subject  to  having  sufficient  unpledged  collateral  available  at  the  time  the
transactions are to be  consummated, in addition to  overall liquidity and  risk appetite of the  various counterparties. In  2023, BPPR
became  an  approved  counterparty  in  the  Federal  Reserve’s  Standing  Repo  Facility.  This  allows  approved  counterparties  to
participate in  daily auctions with  the Standing  Repo Facility  for up  to $500 billion in  aggregate of  overnight financing  using U.S.
Treasuries and Agency MBS as  collateral. The Corporation’s  unpledged debt securities amounted to $  4.6 billion at  December 31,
2023 and $ 7.8 billion at December  31, 2022. A  substantial portion of  these debt securities  could be used  to raise financing in the
U.S. money markets  or from  secured lending  sources, subject to changes in their fair market  value and  customary  adjustments
(haircuts). 

Additional liquidity may  be provided through loan maturities, prepayments  and sales. The  loan portfolio can  also be used  to obtain
funding in the capital markets. In particular,  mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have secondary markets which the
Corporation could use.

Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments

In the ordinary course  of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that  are not recorded on the balance sheet or
may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a
provider of  financial services,  the Corporation  routinely enters  into commitments  with off-balance  sheet risk  to meet  the financial
needs of its customers. These commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of  credit. These commitments are
subject  to  the  same  credit  policies  and  approval process  used for  on-balance sheet  instruments. These  instruments involve, to
varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement  of financial position.
Refer to  Note 24  to the  Consolidated Financial Statements for  information on  the Corporation’s  commitments to  extent credit  and
other non-credit commitments. 

Other types  of off-balance  sheet arrangements that the  Corporation enters in the  ordinary course  of business  include derivatives,
operating  leases  and  provision  of  guarantees,  indemnifications,  and  representation  and  warranties.  Refer  to  Note  33  to  the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information on operating leases and  to Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
a  detailed  discussion  related  to  the  Corporation’s  obligations  under  credit  recourse  and  representation  and  warranties
arrangements. 

The Corporation monitors its cash requirements, including its contractual obligations and debt commitments. 

FDIC Special Assessments 

On  November  16,  2023,  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (“FDIC”)  approved  a  final  rule  that  imposes  a  special
assessment (the “FDIC  Special Assessment”) to recover the losses to the deposit  insurance fund (“DIF”) resulting from the  FDIC’s
use,  in  March  2023,  of  the  systemic  risk  exception to  the  least-cost resolution  test  under  the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act  in
connection with the receiverships of several failed banks.

Under the final rule, the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institution’s  (“IDI”) estimated
uninsured deposits,  as reported  in the  IDI’s December 31,  2022 Call  Report, excluding  the first  $5 billion  in estimated  uninsured
deposits. For a holding company that has more than one IDI subsidiary, such as Popular, the $5 billion exclusion is allocated among
the company’s IDI subsidiaries in proportion to  each IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments will be collected
at an annual rate of approximately 13.4  basis points per year  (3.35 basis points per  quarter) over eight quarters  in 2024 and 2025,
with  the  first  assessment period beginning  January  1,  2024. In  their  December  31,  2022  Call  Reports, BPPR  and  PB  reported
estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $28.1 billion, including $16.2 billion in fully collateralized public sector deposits, and
$3.5 billion,  respectively.  The Corporation  recorded an  expense of  $71.4 million,  $45.3 million  net of  tax, in the  fourth quarter  of
2023, representing the full amount of the assessment.

By statute, the FDIC is required to recover the loss arising from the use of a systemic risk determination through one or more special
assessments. As of  December 31, 2023,  the FDIC’s  loss estimate described  in the final rule had increased by  approximately $4.1
billion to $20.4 billion, or approximately 25%.  The exact amount of losses will be determined when the FDIC terminates the related
receiverships considered  in the  final rule.  Accordingly,  the special  assessment amount  and collection  period may  change as  the
estimated loss is  periodically adjusted  or if the  total amount collected  varies. If  the most  recent increase  in the  FDIC’s estimate

93

 
 
remains unchanged  and is  assessed in  the same  manner,  the Corporation estimates  that the  incremental expense  for the  FDIC
Special Assessment could be approximately $18 million.

Financial information of guarantor and issuers of registered guaranteed securities

The Corporation (not  including any of  its subsidiaries, “PIHC”) is the parent  holding company of Popular North America  “PNA” and
has other subsidiaries through which it conducts its financial services operations. PNA is an operating, 100% subsidiary of Popular,
Inc. Holding Company  (“PIHC”) and  is the  holding company  of its  wholly-owned subsidiaries:  Equity One,  Inc. and PB,  including
PB’s wholly-owned subsidiaries Popular Equipment Finance, LLC, Popular Insurance Agency, U.S.A., and E-LOAN, Inc.

PNA  has  issued  junior  subordinated  debentures  guaranteed  by  PIHC  (together  with  PNA,  the  “obligor  group”)  purchased  by
statutory trusts  established by  the Corporation.  These debentures  were purchased  by the  statutory trust  using the  proceeds from
trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as “capital securities”), together with the proceeds of the related issuances
of common securities of the trusts.

PIHC  fully  and  unconditionally  guarantees  the  junior  subordinated  debentures  issued  by  PNA.  PIHC’s  obligation  to  make  a
guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct  payment of the required amounts to the holders of the applicable capital securities or
by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions
by  the  applicable  trust  except  to  the  extent  such  trust  has  funds  available  for  such  payments. If  PIHC  does  not  make  interest
payments on the  debentures held by such  trust, such trust will not pay  distributions on the applicable  capital securities and will not
have  funds  available  for  such  payments.  PIHC’s  guarantee  of  PNA’s  junior  subordinated  debentures  is  unsecured  and  ranks
subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the PIHC’s other liabilities in the same manner as the applicable debentures as  set
forth in the applicable indentures; and equally with all other guarantees that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee
of  payment and not of collection, which means  that  the guaranteed party  may sue the guarantor to  enforce its  rights  under the
respective guarantee without suing any other person or entity.

The  principal  sources  of  funding  for  PIHC  and  PNA  have  included  dividends  received  from  their  banking  and  non-banking
subsidiaries, asset  sales and  proceeds from  the issuance  of debt  and equity.  As further  described below,  in the  Risk to  Liquidity
section, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository  institution may pay to its holding  company
without regulatory approval. 

The  following  summarized  financial  information  presents  the  financial  position  of  the  obligor  group,  on  a  combined  basis  at
December  31,  2023  and  December 31,  2022,  and  the  results  of their  operations for  the  years  ended December  31,  2023  and
December 31, 2022. Investments in and equity in the earnings from the other subsidiaries and affiliates that  are not members of the
obligor group have been excluded.

The  summarized  financial  information  of  the  obligor  group  is  presented  on  a  combined  basis  with  intercompany  balances  and
transactions  between  entities  in  the  obligor  group  eliminated.  The  obligor  group's  amounts  due  from,  amounts  due  to  and
transactions with  subsidiaries and  affiliates have been  presented in  separate line  items, if  they are  material.  In addition, related
parties transactions are presented separately.

Risks to Liquidity

Total lines of credit outstanding, or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily a measure of the total credit
available  on  a  continuing  basis.  Some  of  these  lines  could  be  subject  to  collateral  requirements,  changes  to  the  value  of  the
collateral, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements, among other factors.  Derivatives, such
as  those  embedded  in  long-term  repurchase  transactions  or  interest  rate  swaps,  and  off-balance  sheet  exposures,  such  as
recourse, performance bonds  or credit card  arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements.  As their fair  value increases, the
collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities.

The importance of  the Puerto Rico  market for the  Corporation is an additional risk factor  that could affect  its financing activities.  In
the case of a deterioration in economic  and fiscal conditions  in Puerto Rico,  the credit quality  of the Corporation could be  affected
and result  in higher  credit costs.  Refer to  the Geographic  and Government  Risk section  of this  MD&A for  some highlights  on the
current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis.

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory
changes, could also  affect  its ability to  obtain funding.  In order to  prepare for  the possibility of  such scenario,  management has
adopted  contingency  plans  for  raising  financing  under  stress  scenarios  when  important  sources  of  funds  that  are  usually  fully
available  are  temporarily unavailable. These  plans call  for  using alternate  funding mechanisms, such  as  the  pledging of certain
asset classes  and accessing  secured credit  lines and  loan facilities  put in  place with  the FHLB  and the  FRB. The  Corporation is
subject to  positive tangible  capital requirements to  utilize secured  loan facilities  with the  FHLB that  could result in  a limitation  of
borrowing amounts or maturity terms, even if the Corporation exceeds well-capitalized regulatory capital levels. 

The credit  ratings of  Popular’s debt  obligations are  a relevant  factor for  liquidity because  they impact  the Corporation’s  ability to
borrow in  the  capital  markets, its cost  and  access to  funding  sources. Credit  ratings are  based  on the  financial  strength, credit
quality and  concentrations in  the loan  portfolio, the  level and  volatility of  earnings, capital  adequacy,  the quality  of management,
geographic concentration  in Puerto  Rico, the  liquidity of  the balance  sheet, the  availability of  a significant  base of  core retail  and
commercial deposits, and the Corporation’s ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources, among other factors. 

Furthermore,  various  statutory  provisions  limit  the  amount  of  dividends  an  insured  depository  institution  may  pay  to  its  holding
company without  regulatory approval. A  member bank must  obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any  dividend, if
the total  of all  dividends declared  by the  member bank  during the  calendar year  would exceed  the total  of its  net income  for that
year, combined with  its retained  net income  for the  preceding two years, after  considering those years’ dividend  activity,  less any
required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. During the year ended December 31, 2023, BPPR
declared cash dividends of $200 million. At December 31, 2023, BPPR can declare a dividend of approximately $387 million without
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board due to its retained income, declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves
over  the  measurement  period.  In  addition,  a  member  bank  may  not  declare  or  pay  a  dividend  in  an  amount  greater  than  its
undivided  profits  as  reported in  its  Report of  Condition and Income, unless  the member  bank  has received  the  approval of the
Federal  Reserve  Board.  A  member  bank  also  may  not  permit  any  portion  of  its  permanent  capital  to  be  withdrawn  unless  the
withdrawal  has  been  approved  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Board.  Pursuant  to  these  requirements,  PB  may  not  declare  or  pay  a
dividend without  the prior  approval of  the Federal  Reserve Board and the  NYSDFS. The ability of  a bank  subsidiary to  up-stream
dividends to its BHC could  thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital, including  tangible and regulatory capital, thus
potentially limiting  the amount  of cash  moving up  to the  BHCs from  the banking  subsidiaries. This  could, in  turn, affect  the BHCs
ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock, repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations, for
example. 

The Corporation’s banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, and
therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the Corporation’s overall credit ratings.

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements

The  Corporation’s banking subsidiaries  currently do  not  issue  unsecured senior  debt, as  these  banking subsidiaries  are funded
primarily with  deposits and secured borrowings. The banking  subsidiaries had  $7.8 million in deposits  at December  31, 2023  that
are subject to rating triggers. 

In addition, certain mortgage servicing  and custodial agreements  that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants.  In the
event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for
escrow  deposits  and/or  increase  collateral  levels  securing  the  recourse  obligations.  Also,  as  discussed  in  Note  23  to  the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the  Corporation  services  residential  mortgage  loans  subject  to  credit  recourse  provisions.

96

 
 
Certain  contractual  agreements  require the  Corporation to  post  collateral  to  secure  such  recourse obligations  if  the  institution’s
required  credit  ratings  are  not  maintained.  Collateral  pledged  by  the  Corporation  to  secure  recourse  obligations  amounted  to
approximately  $27.1  million  at  December  31,  2023.  The  Corporation  could  be  required  to  post  additional  collateral  under  the
agreements.  Management  expects  that  it  would  be  able  to  meet  additional  collateral  requirements  if  and  when  needed.  The
requirements to post collateral under  certain agreements or  the loss of escrow deposits  could reduce the  Corporation’s liquidity
resources and impact its operating results.

Credit Risk

Geographic and Government Risk 

The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. The Corporation’s assets and revenue composition by geographical
area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 37 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico

A significant portion  of our financial  activities and  credit exposure is  concentrated in  the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico  (“Puerto
Rico”), which has faced severe economic and fiscal challenges in the past and may face additional challenges in the future. 

Economic Performance. 

Puerto Rico’s economy suffered  a severe and  prolonged recession  from 2007 to 2017, with real  gross national  product (“GNP”)
contracting approximately 15%  during this period. In 2017,  Hurricane María caused  significant damage and  destruction across the
island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico’s  economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in part aided by
the large amount  of federal disaster relief and recovery  assistance funds injected  into the Puerto  Rico economy in  connection with
Hurricane María and other recent natural disasters. This growth was interrupted by the economic shock caused  by the  COVID-19
pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part aided by additional federal assistance from pandemic-related stimulus measures.

The  latest Puerto  Rico Economic Activity  Index,  published by the Economic Development Bank  for Puerto  Rico (the “Economic
Activity  Index”),  reflected  a  5.9%  year-over-year  increase  and  a  0.2%  month-over-month  decrease  in  November  2023.  The
Economic Activity Index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real GNP. The Puerto
Rico Planning Board estimates that Puerto Rico’s real GNP grew 0.8%  during fiscal year 2023  (July 2022-June 2023) and projects
1.8% real GNP growth for fiscal year 2024 (July 2023-June-2024).

While the  Puerto Rico  economy has  not directly  tracked the  United States  economy in  recent years,  many of  the external  factors
that impact  the Puerto Rico economy are affected  by the  policies and performance  of the  United States economy. These external
factors include the level of interest rates and the rate  of inflation. Inflation in the United States, as measured by the  United States
Consumer  Price  Index  (published  by  the  U.S.  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics),  increased  3.4%  during  the  12-month  period  ended
December 2023.  Inflation in Puerto Rico,  as measured by the  Puerto Rico Consumer Price Index (published by the  Department of
Labor  and  Human  Resources of Puerto  Rico), increased  2.0%  during the  12-month  period  ended December  2023.  The  rate  of
inflation  gradually  decreased  from  a  mid-2022  peak,  as  the  Federal  Reserve  implemented  a  series  of  benchmark  interest  rate
increases. 

Fiscal Challenges. 

As the  Puerto Rico economy contracted, the  government’s public debt rose rapidly, in part from borrowing to  cover deficits to pay
debt service,  pension benefits and  other government expenditures.  By 2016, the Puerto Rico government had  over $120 billion in
combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had lost access to the capital markets, and was in the midst of a fiscal crisis.

Puerto Rico’s  escalating fiscal  and economic  challenges and imminent  widespread defaults  in its public debt  prompted the  U.S.
Congress to  enact the  Puerto Rico  Oversight, Management,  and Economic  Stability Act  (“PROMESA”) in  June 2016.  PROMESA
created the “Oversight Board” with ample powers over Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations,
instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively,  “PR Government Entities”). Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will be  in

97

 
 
 
 
place  until  market  access  is  restored  and  balanced  budgets  are  produced  for  at  least  four  consecutive  years.  PROMESA  also
established two  mechanisms for  the restructuring  of the  obligations of  PR Government  Entities: (a)  Title III,  which provides  an in-
court process that incorporates many of the  powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and permits adjustment of a broad
range of obligations, and  (b) Title VI,  which provides for a  largely out-of-court process through which  modifications to financial debt
can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors and bind holdouts.

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several of its instrumentalities have availed themselves of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles
III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities,
including  Government  Development  Bank  for  Puerto  Rico,  the  Puerto  Rico  Sales  Tax  Financing  Corporation,  the  Puerto  Rico
Highways  and  Transportation  Authority,  and  the  Puerto  Rico  Industrial  Development  Company,  have  also  completed  debt
restructurings  under  Titles  III  or  VI  of  PROMESA.  While  the  majority  of  the  debt  has  already  been  restructured,  some  PR
Government  Entities  still  face  significant  fiscal  challenges.  For  example,  the  Puerto  Rico  Electric  Power  Authority  is  still  in  the
process of restructuring its debts under Title III of PROMESA.

Municipalities. 

Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic challenges have also adversely impacted its municipalities. Budgetary subsidies to municipalities
have gradually declined  in recent  years and were scheduled  to be ultimately  eliminated by  fiscal year  2025 as part of the  fiscal
measures required  by the Oversight  Board. However,  over the  past years, the  Oversight Board  has authorized and  funded new
appropriations  and  investments  to  offset  the  decline  in  intergovernmental  transfers  to  municipalities.  Beyond  those  sources  of
alternate funding, municipalities have also received significant federal disaster and COVID-relief funding in  recent years. According
to the  latest Puerto  Rico fiscal  plan certified  by the  Oversight Board,  taken together,  the funding  available to  municipalities in  the
near-term is substantial. The fiscal plan notes, however, that the desired progress to achieve fiscal discipline and implement critical
reforms has not been achieved,  and that municipalities must work with  the Executive branch to analyze the financial needs of each
individual municipality and focus on the necessary enhancements in municipal shared services and other municipal and government
initiatives. Pursuant to the fiscal plan, once the transformational measures  and milestones related to  these initiatives are achieved,
additional funding from the central government may be made available to municipalities to improve fiscal sustainability.

Municipalities  are  subject  to  PROMESA  and,  at  the  Oversight  Board’s  request,  are  required  to  submit  fiscal  plans  and  annual
budgets to  the Oversight Board for its  review and  approval. They are  also  required to  seek  Oversight Board  approval to issue,
guarantee or  modify  their  debts and  to  enter  into contracts  with an  aggregate value  of  $10 million or  more.  With the  Oversight
Board’s approval, municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. To
date, however, no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring process.

Exposure of the Corporation 

The credit quality of BPPR’s  loan portfolio reflects, among other  things, the general economic conditions  in Puerto Rico and  other
adverse conditions affecting Puerto  Rico consumers and businesses. Deterioration in the Puerto  Rico economy has resulted in the
past, and could result in the future,  in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses,  which could materially affect
our financial condition and results of operations. 

At December 31,  2023, the  Corporation’s direct  exposure to  PR Government  Entities totaled  $362 million, of  which $333  million
were  outstanding, compared  to  $374  million  at  December  31,  2022,  of  which  $327  million  were  outstanding. A  deterioration in
Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic situation could adversely  affect the value of  our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in
losses to us. Of the amount outstanding, $314 million consists of loans and $19 million are securities ($302 million and $25 million,
respectively,  at December  31, 2022).  All of  the Corporation’s  direct exposure outstanding at  December 31,  2023 were  obligations
from various  Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases,  these were  “general obligations” of a  municipality, to which  the applicable
municipality has pledged its  good faith, credit  and unlimited  taxing power,  or “special obligations”  of a municipality,  to which the
applicable municipality has pledged basic  property tax  or sales  tax  revenues. At  December 31,  2023, 76%  of the Corporation’s
exposure to  municipal loans  and securities  was concentrated in the  municipalities of  San Juan,  Guaynabo, Carolina and Caguas.
For  additional  discussion  of  the  Corporation’s  direct  exposure  to  the  Puerto  Rico  government  and  its  instrumentalities  and
municipalities, refer to Note 24 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In  addition,  at  December  31,  2023,  the  Corporation  had  $238  million  in  loans  insured  or  securities  issued  by  Puerto  Rico
governmental entities,  but for  which the  principal source  of repayment  is non-governmental  ($251 million at  December 31, 2022).
These included $191 million in residential mortgage  loans insured by  the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority  (“HFA”),  a PR

98

 
 
 
Government  Entity  (December  31,  2022  -  $209 million).  These  mortgage  loans  are  secured  by  first  mortgages  on  Puerto  Rico
residential properties and the  HFA insurance  covers losses  in the event of  a borrower default and  upon the  satisfaction of certain
other conditions. The Corporation also had at December 31, 2023, $40 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second
mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for  which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses  in the event  of a
borrower default,  and  upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions  (December 31, 2022  -  $42 million).  In the  event that  the
mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the
collateral is  insufficient to  satisfy the  outstanding balance  of these  loans, HFA’s  ability to  honor its  insurance will  depend, among
other factors,  on the  financial condition  of HFA  at the  time such  obligations become  due and  payable. The  Corporation does  not
consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio. 

BPPR’s commercial loan  portfolio also  includes loans  to private borrowers  who are service  providers, lessors,  suppliers or  have
other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and  economic
situation  of  PR  Government  Entities.  Similarly,  BPPR’s  mortgage  and  consumer  loan  portfolios  include  loans  to  government
employees  and  retirees,  which  could  also  be  negatively  affected  by  fiscal  measures,  such  as  employee layoffs  or  furloughs  or
reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic situation deteriorates.

As  of  December  31,  2023,  BPPR  had  $18.1  billion  in  deposits  from  the  Puerto  Rico  government,  its  instrumentalities,  and
municipalities. The rate at  which public deposit balances may  decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The  amount and timing of
any such  reduction is  likely to  be impacted  by,  for example,  the speed  at which  federal assistance  is distributed  and the  financial
condition, liquidity  and cash management practices of  such entities, as well  as on the ability  of BPPR to maintain  these customer
relationships.

The Corporation may  also have  direct exposure with  regards to  avoidance and  other causes  of action initiated  by the  Oversight
Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 24
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

United States Virgin Islands

The  Corporation  has  operations  in  the  United  States  Virgin  Islands  (the  “USVI”)  and  has  credit  exposure  to  USVI  government
entities.

The USVI has  been experiencing a number of fiscal  and economic challenges, which could adversely affect the ability of its  public
corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such,
there  is  currently  no  federal  legislation  permitting  the  restructuring  of  the  debts  of  the  USVI  and  its  public  corporations  and
instrumentalities.

To  the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the  U.S. Congress or the  Government of the USVI may
enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor
remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI.

At December  31, 2023, the Corporation  had approximately $28  million in  direct exposure to  USVI government entities (December
31, 2022 - $28 million). 

British Virgin Islands

The  Corporation has  operations in the  British Virgin  Islands (“BVI”), which  was negatively affected by  the COVID-19 pandemic,
particularly as  a reduction  in the  tourism activity which accounts for a  significant portion of its  economy. Although the  Corporation
has  no  significant  exposure  to  a  single  borrower  in  the  BVI,  at  December  31,  2023,  it  has  a  loan  portfolio  amounting  to
approximately  $205  million  comprised  of  various  retail  and  commercial  clients,  compared  to  a  loan  portfolio  of  $214  million  at
December 31, 2022.

U.S. Government

As further detailed in Notes 6 and 7 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the Corporation’s investment
securities represented exposure  to the U.S. Government in  the form of U.S. Government  sponsored entities,  as well as agency
mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.9 billion of residential mortgages, $9.2 million of SBA loans under the
Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and $80 million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by  the U.S. Government or its
agencies at December 31, 2023 (compared to $1.6 billion, $38 million and $72 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022).

99

 
 
 
Non-Performing Assets

Non-performing assets (“NPAs”)  include primarily past-due  loans that are no longer accruing interest,  renegotiated loans, and  real
estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented in Table 23.

During 2023,  the Corporation  continued to  reflect credit  quality normalization.  Non-performing loans  (“NPLs”) and  net charge  offs
(“NCOs”)  continued  below  historical  pre-pandemic  averages.  Consumer  portfolios,  however,  reflected  certain  credit  quality
deterioration,  particularly  the  personal  loans  and  credit  cards  portfolios,  with  delinquencies  and  NCOs  near  or  exceeding  pre-
pandemic levels. The auto loans portfolio also showed credit normalization, however,  metrics remained below pre-pandemic levels.
The commercial and mortgage portfolios continue  to operate with historically low levels of NCOs and NPLs.  We continue to closely
monitor  changes  in  the  macroeconomic  environment  and  on  borrower  performance  given  higher  interest  rates  and  inflationary
pressures.  However,  management believes  that  the improvements over  recent years  in  risk management  practices and  the risk
profile of the Corporation’s loan portfolios position Popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment.

Total  NPAs  decreased  by  $91  million  when  compared  with  December  31,  2022.  Total  non-performing  loans  held-in-portfolio
(“NPLs”)  decreased  by  $82  million  from  December  31,  2022.  BPPR’s  NPLs  decreased  by  $73  million,  mainly  driven  by  lower
mortgage  NPLs  by  $67  million.  Popular  U.S.  NPLs  decreased  by  $9  million  from  December  31,  2022,  mainly  driven  by  lower
mortgage NPLs. At December 31, 2023, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 1.0% compared to 1.4%, at December
31, 2022. Other  real estate owned loans (“OREOs”) decreased by  $9 million. At  December 31, 2023, NPLs secured by real estate
amounted to  $231 million  in the Puerto Rico  operations and $24 million  in Popular  U.S. These figures were  $303 million  and $33
million, respectively, at December 31, 2022.

The Corporation’s commercial  loan portfolio  secured by  real estate  (“CRE”) amounted  to $10.6 billion  at December 31,  2023, of
which  $3.1  billion  was  secured  with  owner  occupied  properties,  compared  with  $9.9  billion  and  $3.1  billion,  respectively,  at
December 31, 2022. CRE NPLs amounted to  $48 million at December 31, 2023, compared with $54 million at December 31,  2022.
The  CRE  NPL  ratios  for  the  BPPR  and  Popular  U.S.  segments  were  0.86%  and  0.13%,  respectively,  at  December  31,  2023,
compared with 1.04% and 0.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2022.

In addition to the NPLs included in Table 23, at December 31, 2023, there were $510 million of performing loans, mostly commercial
loans, which in management’s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2022
- $374 million).

For the  year ended  December 31,  2023, total  inflows of  NPLs held-in-portfolio,  excluding consumer  loans, remained  flat at  $213
million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2022. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment increased
by $22  million compared to the  same period  in 2022,  driven by  higher commercial and construction inflows by  $25 million  and $9
million,  respectively,  in part offset  by lower mortgage inflows by $12 million. Commercial increase  incudes an $18 million inflow
during the fourth quarter of  2023. Inflows of  NPLs held-in-portfolio at  the Popular U.S.  segment decreased by  $21 million from  the
same period in 2022, mainly driven by lower commercial inflows.

[2] It is the Corporation’s policy to report delinquent  residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed  by the VA as accruing  loans past due 90
days or  more as  opposed to  non-performing since  the principal  repayment is  insured.  These balances  include $106  million of  residential mortgage
loans insured  by FHA  or guaranteed  by the  VA  that are  no longer  accruing interest  as of  December 31,  2023 (December  31, 2022  - $190  million).
Furthermore,  at  December  31,2023  the  Corporation  had  approximately  $38  million  in  reverse  mortgage  loans  which  are  guaranteed  by  FHA,  but
which are currently  not accruing interest. Due  to the guaranteed nature  of the loans, it is  the Corporation’s policy to  exclude these balances from  non-
performing assets (December 31, 2022 - $42 million).

Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)

The  allowance  for  credit  losses  (“ACL”),  represents  management’s  estimate  of  expected  credit  losses  through  the  remaining
contractual life  of the  different loan  segments, impacted  by expected  prepayments. The  ACL is  maintained at  a sufficient  level to
provide for  estimated credit  losses on  collateral dependent  loans as  well as  loans modified  for borrowers  with financial  difficulties
separately  from  the  remainder  of  the  loan  portfolio.  The  Corporation’s  management  evaluates  the  adequacy  of  the  ACL  on  a
quarterly  basis.  In  this  evaluation, management considers  current  conditions,  macroeconomic economic  expectations through  a
reasonable and supportable period,  historical loss experience, portfolio composition  by loan type and risk characteristics, results  of
periodic credit reviews of individual loans, and regulatory requirements, amongst other factors.

The Corporation must rely on  estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such  as
economic developments affecting specific  customers, industries, or markets.  Other factors that can  affect management’s estimates
are  recalibration  of  statistical  models  used  to  calculate  lifetime  expected  losses,  changes  in  underwriting  standards,  financial
accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers,
in economic  conditions, and  in the  condition of  the various  markets in  which collateral  may be  sold, may  also affect  the required
level of  the allowance  for credit  losses. Consequently,  the business  financial condition,  liquidity,  capital, and  results of  operations
could also be affected.

At December  31, 2023,  the allowance  for credit  losses amounted  to $729  million, an  increase of  $9 million,  when compared  with
December 31,  2022. The  ACL for  BPPR increased  by $24  million to  $640 million,  when compared to December  31, 2022,  mostly
driven  by  changes  in  the  economic  scenario,  higher  loan  volumes  and  changes  in  credit  quality.  The  ACL  for  Popular  U.S.
decreased by $15 million to $89 million, when compared to  December 31, 2022, due  to the implementation of  a new model for the
U.S. commercial real estate portfolio. The new model  is based on more granular regional information for the  Corporation’s portfolio
and accounted for $15 million of PB’s reduction in ACL.

Given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the  Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its ACL. The
baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario. The Corporation evaluates,
at  least  on  an  annual  basis,  the  assumptions  tied  to  the  CECL  accounting  framework.  These  include  the  reasonable  and
supportable period as well as the reversion window. 

GDP growth is expected to slow during 2024 for both regions, when compared to 2023, as a result of the Fed’s monetary policy. The
2024 GDP growth is expected to  be 1.2% for Puerto Rico and 1.7% for the United States. The average 2024 unemployment rate is
expected to increase to 6.79% in Puerto Rico and 3.95% in the United States.

The provision  for credit  losses for  the year  ended December  31, 2023,  amounted to  $201.5 million,  compared to  an expense  of
$83.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, mostly related to higher NCOs. Refer to Note 9 – Allowance for credit losses –
loans held-in-portfolio  to the  Consolidated Financial  Statements, and  to the Provision  for Credit  Losses section  of this  MD&A for
additional information. 

The following  table presents  net charge-offs  to average  loans held-in-portfolio (“HIP”) ratios  by loan  category for  the years  ended

NCOs for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to  $146.4 million, increasing by $87.1 million when compared to the same
period in 2022. The  BPPR segment increased by $78.6 million mainly driven by higher consumer NCOs by $68.3 million, reflective
of certain credit  quality deterioration, particularly the personal loans  and credit cards  portfolios, with delinquencies  and NCOs near
or exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The auto loans portfolio also showed credit normalization, however, metrics remained below pre-
pandemic levels. The PB segment NCOs increased by $8.5 million, mainly driven by higher consumer NCOs by $13.5 million.

Enterprise Risk Management

The Corporation’s  Board of  Directors has  established a  Risk Management  Committee (“RMC”)  to, among  other things,  assist the
Board in its (i) oversight of the Corporation’s overall risk framework and (ii) to monitor, review, and approve policies to measure, limit
and manage the Corporation’s risks. 

The  Corporation has  established a  three  lines  of  defense framework:  (a)  business  line management constitutes  the  first  line  of
defense by identifying  and managing the  risks associated with  business activities, (b) components  of the Risk  Management Group
and  the  Corporate  Security  Group,  among  others,  act  as  the  second  line  of  defense  by,  among  other  things,  measuring  and
reporting on the Corporation’s risk activities, and (c) the Corporate Auditing Division, as the third line of defense, reporting directly to
the Audit Committee of the Board, by independently providing assurance regarding the effectiveness of the risk framework.

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the “ERM Committee”) is a management committee whose purpose is to oversee and
monitor Market, Interest, Liquidity, Regulatory and Financial Compliance, BSA/AML & Sanctions, Regulatory,  Strategic, Operational
(including  Fraud  and  Third  Party  Risk,  among  others),  Information  Technology  and  Cyber  Security,  Legal,  Credit,  Climate  and
Reputational risks, as defined in the Risk Appetite Statement of the Risk Management Policy and within the Corporation’s Enterprise
Risk Management (“ERM”) framework. The ERM Committee and the Enterprise Risk Management Department in the Financial and
Operational Risk Management  Division (the “FORM Division”), in  coordination with the  Chief Risk Officer, create  the framework to
identify and manage multiple and cross-enterprise risks, and to articulate the RAS and supporting metrics.

The  Enterprise  Risk  Management  Department  has  established  a  process  to  ensure  that  an  appropriate  standard  readiness
assessment is performed before we launch a new product or service. Similar procedures are followed with the Treasury  Division for
transactions involving the purchase and sale of assets, and by the Mergers and Acquisitions Division for acquisition transactions.

The Asset/Liability  Committee (“ALCO”),  composed of  senior management  representatives from  the business  lines and  corporate
functions, and the Corporate Finance Group, are responsible for planning and executing the Corporation’s market, interest rate risk,
funding  activities  and  strategy,  as  well  as  for  implementing  approved  policies  and  procedures.  The  ALCO  also  reviews  the
Corporation’s  capital  policy  and  the  attainment  of the  capital  management  objectives. In  addition, the  Financial  Risk, Corporate
Insurance & Advisory Department independently measures, monitors and reports compliance with  liquidity and market risk policies,
and oversees controls surrounding interest risk measurements.

The Corporate Compliance  Committee, comprised of senior management team  members and representatives from the Regulatory
and Financial  Compliance Division  and the  Financial Crimes  Compliance Division,  among others,  are responsible  for overseeing
and  assessing  the  adequacy  of  the  risk  management  processes  that  underlie  Popular’s  compliance  program  for  identifying,
assessing,  measuring,  monitoring,  testing,  mitigating,  and  reporting  compliance  risks.  They  also  supervise  Popular’s  reporting
obligations  under  the  compliance  program  to  ensure  the  adequacy,  consistency  and  timeliness  of  the  reporting  of  compliance-
related risks across the Corporation. 

The Regulatory Affairs team is responsible for maintaining an open dialog with the banking regulatory agencies to ensure regulatory
risks are properly identified, measured,  monitored, as well  as communicated to  the appropriate regulatory  agency as necessary  to
keep them apprised of material matters within the purview of these agencies.

The  Credit  Strategy  Committee,  composed  of  senior  level  management  representatives  from  the  business  lines  and  corporate
functions, and the Corporate Credit Risk Management Division, are responsible for monitoring credit risk management activities both
at  the  corporate  level  and  across  all  Popular  subsidiaries  to  ensure  the  development  and  consistent  application  of  credit  risk
policies, processes  and procedures  that measure,  limit and  manage credit  risks, while  seeking to  maintain the  effectiveness and
efficiency of the operating and businesses processes. 

The Corporation’s Operational Risk Committee (“ORCO”) composed of senior level management representatives from the business
lines  and  corporate  functions,  provide  executive  oversight  of  the  operational  risk  management  activities  of  Popular  and  its
subsidiaries  to  ensure  the  development  and  consistent  application  of  operational  risk  policies,  processes,  and  procedures  that
measure,  limit,  and  manage  operational  risks  while  maintaining  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  operating  and  business
processes.  The  FORM  Division,  within  the  Risk  Management  Group,  serves  as  ORCO’s  operating  arm  and  is  responsible  for
establishing baseline processes to measure, monitor, limit and manage operational risk.

The Corporate Security Group (“CSG”), under the direction of the Chief Security Officer, leads all efforts pertaining to cybersecurity,
enterprise fraud and data privacy, including developing strategies and oversight processes with  policies and programs that mitigate
compliance, operational,  strategic, financial  and reputational  risks associated  with the  Corporation’s and  our customers’  data and
assets. 

The Information Technology  and Cyber Risk Committee, composed of senior management representatives from the business lines
and  corporate functions, the  Information Technology  Division and  the  CSG,  are  responsible for  the  oversight  and  monitoring of
information  technology  and  cybersecurity  risks,  mitigation  strategies,  actions  and  controls,  key  risk  metrics,  and  information
technology and cyber incidents that may result in operational, compliance and reputational risks. The Chief Security Officer also co-
chairs the Information Technology & Cyber Security Risk Committee along with the Chief Information & Digital Strategy Officer.

The Corporate Legal Division, in this context, has the responsibility of assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting with respect to
legal risks, including those related to litigation, investigations and other material legal matters. 

The Corporation  has also  established an  ESG Committee  whose purpose  and responsibility  is to  oversee the  Corporation’s ESG
strategies and  support the  development and  consistent application  of policies,  processes and  procedures that  measure, limit  and

109

manage ESG matters and risks. The ESG  Committee also assesses  ESG-related considerations in  the credit  approval process of
commercial credit applications.

The processes  of strategic  risk planning  and the  evaluation of  reputational risk  are on-going  processes through  which continuous
data gathering  and analysis  are performed. In order  to ensure  strategic risks  are properly  identified and monitored, the  Corporate
Strategy and Transformation Division,  which reports to  the Corporation’s  Chief Operations Officer,  performs periodic assessments
regarding corporate strategic priority  initiatives, such as  the Corporation’s  transformation initiative and other emerging issues.  The
Acquisitions  and  Corporate  Investments  Division  continuously  assesses  potential  strategic  transactions.  The  Corporate
Communications  Division  is  responsible  for  the  monitoring,  management  and  implementation  of  action  plans  with  respect  to
reputational risk issues.

Popular’s capital planning process integrates the Corporation’s risk profile as well as its strategic focus, operating environment, and
other factors  that could  materially affect  capital adequacy  in hypothetical  highly-stressed business scenarios. Capital  ratio targets
and triggers take into consideration the different risks evaluated under Popular’s risk management framework.

In addition to  establishing a  formal process  to manage  risk, our  corporate culture  is also  critical to  an effective  risk management
function.  Through our Code  of Ethics, the Corporation provides a framework  for all our  employees to conduct themselves with the
highest integrity.

*  Shows  the  effect  of  the  tax  exempt  status  of  some  loans  and  investments  on  their  yield,  using  the  applicable  statutory  income  tax  rates.  The
computation considers  the interest  expense disallowance  required by  the Puerto  Rico Internal  Revenue Code.  This adjustment  is shown  in order  to
compare the yields of the tax exempt and taxable assets  on a taxable basis. 

Note: Average loan  balances include the  average balance of  non-accruing loans. No  interest income is  recognized for these  loans in accordance  with
the Corporation’s  policy.  Average  balances  exclude  unrealized  gains  or  losses  on  debt  securities  available-for-sale  and  unrealized  losses  on  debt
securities transfer to held-to-maturities.
