SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 

FDIC Special Assessment Increase in Estimate 

On &#160;

November 16, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Deposit &#160;

Insurance &#160;

Corporation &#160;

(&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) &#160;

approved &#160;

a &#160;

final &#160;

rule &#160;

that &#160;

imposes &#160;

a &#160;

special 

assessment (the &#8220;FDIC &#160;

Special Assessment&#8221;) to recover &#160;

the losses to &#160;

the deposit insurance &#160;

fund resulting from &#160;

the FDIC&#8217;s use, &#160;

in 

March 2023, &#160;

of the systemic &#160;

risk exception to &#160;

the least-cost resolution &#160;

test under the &#160;

Federal Deposit Insurance &#160;

Act in &#160;

connection 

with &#160;

the &#160;

receiverships &#160;

of &#160;

several &#160;

failed &#160;

banks. &#160;

In &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

this &#160;

assessment, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

recorded &#160;

an &#160;

expense &#160;

of 

$71.4 million, $45.3 million net of tax, in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing the full amount of the estimated assessment at that 

time. 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Corporation &#160;

recorded an additional expense of $14.3 million, $9.1 &#160;

million net of tax, to 

reflect the &#160;

FDIC's higher loss &#160;

estimate which increased &#160;

from $16.3 billion, &#160;

when approved, to &#160;

$20.4 billion during &#160;

the quarter. &#160;

The 

special assessment &#160;

amount and &#160;

collection period &#160;

may change &#160;

as the &#160;

estimated loss &#160;

is periodically &#160;

adjusted or &#160;

if the &#160;

total amount 

collected varies. &#160;

Tax impact on Intercompany Distributions 

The &#160;

net &#160;

income &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended March 31, &#160;

2024, &#160;

included &#160;

$22.9 million of &#160;

expenses, &#160;

of &#160;

which &#160;

$16.5 million &#160;

is &#160;

reflected &#160;

in 

income tax &#160;

expense &#160;

and $6.4 &#160;

million is &#160;

reflected in &#160;

other operating &#160;

expenses, &#160;

related to &#160;

an out-of-period &#160;

adjustment associated 

with the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s U.S. subsidiary&#8217;s &#160;

non-payment of taxes &#160;

on certain intercompany &#160;

distributions to the &#160;

Bank Holding Company 

(BHC) in &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

a foreign &#160;

corporation for &#160;

U.S. tax &#160;

purposes. The &#160;

adjustment corrected &#160;

errors for &#160;

income tax &#160;

expense that 

should have &#160;

been recognized &#160;

of $5.5 &#160;

million and &#160;

$5.4 million &#160;

in the &#160;

years 2023 &#160;

and 2022, &#160;

respectively, &#160;

and an &#160;

aggregate of &#160;

$5.6 

million, in the years prior to 2022. The $6.4 million recognized as other operating expense corresponded to interest due up to March 

31, 2024 on &#160;

the related late &#160;

payment of the &#160;

withholding tax, of which &#160;

approximately $3.0 million correspond &#160;

to years prior &#160;

to 2022. 

As a result of this adjustment, the deferred &#160;

tax asset related to NOL of the BHC &#160;

and its related valuation allowance was reduced by 

$53.7 &#160;

million. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

evaluated &#160;

the &#160;

impact &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

out-of-period &#160;

adjustment &#160;

and &#160;

concluded &#160;

it &#160;

was &#160;

not &#160;

material &#160;

to &#160;

any 

previously issued interim or &#160;

annual consolidated financial statements and &#160;

the adjustment is &#160;

not expected to be &#160;

material to the year 

ending December 31, 2024. 

The Corporation &#160;

also recognized &#160;

$6.5 million &#160;

in income &#160;

tax expense &#160;

during the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024 to &#160;

reflect the &#160;

U.S. 

federal &#160;

tax withholding &#160;

liability and &#160;

estimated related &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

income tax &#160;

arising from &#160;

a $50 &#160;

million dividend &#160;

paid during &#160;

the 

quarter. 

Dividends from &#160;

the U.S. &#160;

subsidiaries to &#160;

the BHC &#160;

are subject &#160;

to a &#160;

Federal 10% &#160;

withholding tax &#160;

and ordinary &#160;

income tax &#160;

in Puerto 

Rico, subject &#160;

to &#160;

foreign tax &#160;

credits, &#160;

use of &#160;

available net &#160;

operating losses &#160;

and certain &#160;

other limitations. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not 

anticipate the tax treatment of U.S. sourced dividends &#160;

to the BHC to impact BHC liquidity or future &#160;

capital actions.

prepared under accounting &#160;

principles generally accepted in &#160;

the United 

States (&#8220;U.S. &#160;

GAAP&#8221;) and &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measures. Management &#160;

uses non-GAAP &#160;

financial measures &#160;

when it 

has &#160;

determined &#160;

that &#160;

these &#160;

measures &#160;

provide &#160;

meaningful &#160;

information &#160;

&#160;

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#160;

&#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

is a &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measure. Management &#160;

believes that &#160;

this presentation 

provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison &#160;

of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest earning &#160;

assets include &#160;

investment securities &#160;

and loans &#160;

that are &#160;

exempt from &#160;

income tax, &#160;

principally in 

Puerto &#160;

Rico. The &#160;

main sources &#160;

of tax-exempt &#160;

interest income &#160;

are certain &#160;

investments in &#160;

obligations of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. Government, &#160;

its 

agencies and &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

certain obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

and/or its &#160;

agencies and &#160;

municipalities, 

and assets &#160;

held by the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s international banking &#160;

entities. To &#160;

facilitate the comparison &#160;

of interest related &#160;

to these &#160;

assets, 

the &#160;

interest &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

converted &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis, &#160;

using &#160;

the &#160;

applicable &#160;

statutory &#160;

income &#160;

tax &#160;

rates &#160;

for &#160;

each &#160;

period. &#160;

According to the &#160;

Puerto Rico tax &#160;

law, a &#160;

portion of interest &#160;

cost, based on &#160;

an equal proportion &#160;

of tax-exempt assets to &#160;

total assets, 

and an &#160;

allocation of &#160;

Financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 

&#9679;

&#160;

For the &#160;

quarter ended March &#160;

31, 2024, the &#160;

Corporation recorded net &#160;

income of $ &#160;

103.3 million, compared &#160;

to net &#160;

income of $ 

159.0 million for the same quarter of the &#160;

previous year. Net interest margin for the first &#160;

quarter of 2024 was 3.16%, a decrease 

of 6 basis &#160;

points when compared to &#160;

3.22% for the same &#160;

quarter of the previous &#160;

year. The &#160;

decrease was mainly due &#160;

to higher 

deposit costs, principally from &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

public sector and from &#160;

online deposits in the &#160;

U.S., which was partially &#160;

offset by 

higher yield &#160;

from money &#160;

market investments &#160;

and &#160;

loans. On &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, &#160;

the net &#160;

interest margin &#160;

was 3.38%, 

compared to 3.46% for the same quarter of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

Corporation recorded &#160;

a provision &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses of &#160;

$72.6 million, &#160;

compared to 

$47.6 million for the same &#160;

quarter of the previous year. &#160;

The higher provision for credit losses &#160;

was driven by higher reserves in 

our commercial &#160;

and consumer &#160;

portfolios mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher loan &#160;

volumes and &#160;

changes in &#160;

the credit &#160;

ratings and &#160;

the credit 

quality of the US commercial portfolio and the &#160;

BPPR consumer portfolio. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was $163.8 million for the quarter, &#160;

an increase of $1.9 million when compared to the quarter ended March 

31, 2023, &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

service charges &#160;

on deposit &#160;

accounts and &#160;

other service &#160;

fees, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by lower &#160;

income 

from mortgage banking activities resulting from the fair &#160;

value adjustments of mortgage servicing rights. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Operating expenses for the quarter were higher by &#160;

$42.4 million when compared to the quarter ended &#160;

March 31, 2023. Higher 

operating expenses were driven mainly &#160;

by the effect &#160;

of the increase in &#160;

loss estimate related to &#160;

the FDIC Special Assessment, 

higher personnel costs and higher technology and &#160;

software expenses. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Income tax &#160;

during the &#160;

quarter was &#160;

higher by &#160;

$9.3 million &#160;

due to &#160;

the impact &#160;

of the &#160;

tax expense &#160;

recognized on &#160;

intercompany 

distributions from previous &#160;

periods. Compared to &#160;

the same quarter &#160;

in the &#160;

previous year, &#160;

income tax expense &#160;

was also higher 

as the results of &#160;

the first quarter of 2023 included &#160;

the effect of the &#160;

reversal of a valuation allowance of &#160;

a tax credit expected to 

be realized on the U. S. Operations. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Total &#160;

assets at March 31, 2024 amounted to $70.9 billion, compared to &#160;

$70.8 billion, at December 31, 2023. The increase was 

driven by an &#160;

increase in available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) investment securities, &#160;

mainly due to purchases &#160;

of U.S. Treasury Securities, 

and &#160;

loan &#160;

growth, &#160;

mainly &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

mortgage &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

in &#160;

auto &#160;

loans, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

net &#160;

decrease &#160;

in cash &#160;

and &#160;

money 

market investments due to the investments in the &#160;

debt securities portfolio and loan originations. 

&#9679;

Total deposits at March 31, 2024 increased by $190.5 million when compared to deposits at December 31, 2023, mainly due &#160;

to 

higher retail &#160;

deposits, time deposits &#160;

and deposits in &#160;

trust in &#160;

BPPR, partially offset &#160;

by a &#160;

decrease in Puerto &#160;

Rico public &#160;

sector 

deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

Stockholders&#8217; equity as &#160;

of March 31, &#160;

2024 increased by $30.4 &#160;

million from the &#160;

December 31, 2023, mainly &#160;

due to net &#160;

income 

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter of &#160;

$103.3 million &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

amortization of &#160;

unrealized losses &#160;

from &#160;

securities &#160;

previously reclassified &#160;

to &#160;

held-to-

maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) of $35.2 million, net of &#160;

taxes, partially offset by the after-tax &#160;

impact of the increase in net &#160;

unrealized losses in 

the portfolio of &#160;

AFS securities of &#160;

$71.1 million and &#160;

common and preferred &#160;

dividends declared during &#160;

the quarter. &#160;

As of March 

31, 2024, the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book value per common share was $60.06, an increase of $0.32 from December 31, 2023 

due mainly to the increase in stockholders&#8217; equity &#160;

during the period. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Regulatory &#160;

capital &#160;

ratios &#160;

remained strong. &#160;

As &#160;

of &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

common &#160;

equity &#160;

tier &#160;

1 &#160;

capital &#160;

ratio &#160;

was 

16.36%, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.45%, and &#160;

the total capital ratio was 18.19%. Refer to &#160;

within this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

additional discussion &#160;

of significant 

quarterly variances and items impacting the financial performance &#160;

of the Corporation. 

As a financial services company, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected &#160;

by general business and economic conditions 

in the &#160;

markets which &#160;

we serve. &#160;

Lending and &#160;

deposit activities &#160;

and fee &#160;

income generation &#160;

are influenced &#160;

by the &#160;

level of &#160;

business 

spending and &#160;

investment, consumer &#160;

income, spending &#160;

and savings, &#160;

capital market &#160;

activities, competition, &#160;

customer preferences, 

interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates &#160;

on competing products. 

The Corporation &#160;

operates in &#160;

a highly &#160;

regulated environment &#160;

and may &#160;

be adversely &#160;

affected by &#160;

changes in &#160;

federal and &#160;

local laws 

and &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Also, &#160;

competition &#160;

with &#160;

other &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

with &#160;

non-traditional financial &#160;

service &#160;

providers &#160;

and 

technology &#160;

companies &#160;

that &#160;

provide &#160;

electronic &#160;

and &#160;

internet-based &#160;

financial &#160;

solutions &#160;

and &#160;

services, &#160;

could &#160;

adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

its 

profitability. 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

continuously &#160;

monitors &#160;

general &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

industry-related &#160;

indicators &#160;

and &#160;

trends, 

competition, interest rate volatility, credit &#160;

quality indicators, loan and deposit demand, operational and systems efficiencies, &#160;

revenue 

enhancements and changes in the regulation of financial &#160;

services companies. &#160;

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest &#160;

income for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2024 &#160;

was $550.7 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to $531.7 &#160;

million in &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of 

2023, an increase of $19.1 million. Net &#160;

interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for &#160;

the first quarter of 2024 was &#160;

$589.6 million 

compared to $570.4 million in the first quarter of &#160;

2023, an increase of $19.2 million. &#160;

Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.16% compared to 3.22% in the first quarter of 2023 or a decrease of six basis points. On a 

taxable equivalent basis, &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

for the &#160;

first quarter &#160;

of 2024 was &#160;

3.38%, compared to &#160;

3.46% for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter the 

prior year. The main variances in net interest income on a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis were: &#160;

&#9679;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

money market, &#160;

investments, and &#160;

trading securities &#160;

by $55.0 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

driven by &#160;

higher 

average yield by 60 basis points. The increase in &#160;

yield was driven by a higher interest rate environment and reinvestment 

of investment maturities in higher yielding U.S. Treasury bills; 

&#9679;

higher interest income &#160;

from loans &#160;

by $100.2 million &#160;

resulting from an &#160;

increase in &#160;

average loans by &#160;

$3.0 billion &#160;

reflecting 

loan &#160;

increases &#160;

in &#160;

both &#160;

PB &#160;

and &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

across &#160;

most &#160;

portfolios &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

yield &#160;

on &#160;

loans &#160;

by &#160;

51 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

when 

compared to the same quarter of 2023 due to origination of loans in a higher &#160;

interest rate environment and the repricing of 

adjustable-rate loans. The portfolio with the highest variances included commercial loans with an increase of $54.0 million 

in interest &#160;

income, or &#160;

52 basis &#160;

points, consumer &#160;

loans with &#160;

an increase &#160;

of &#160;

$15.8 million &#160;

or 105 &#160;

basis points, &#160;

and auto 

loans which increased $10.6 million or 63 basis &#160;

points. 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

higher interest expense on deposits by $136.3 million driven by higher &#160;

cost of deposits by 99 basis points driven by higher 

average volume &#160;

and higher &#160;

cost of &#160;

market linked &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public deposits &#160;

by $2.7 &#160;

billion and &#160;

higher volume &#160;

of U.S. &#160;

online 

deposits. 

Net interest income for the BPPR segment amounted to $472.8 &#160;

million for the first quarter of 2024, compared &#160;

to $449.8 million in the 

first quarter &#160;

of 2023. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin increased &#160;

to 3.33% &#160;

compared to &#160;

3.24% in &#160;

the first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023. The &#160;

increase in &#160;

net 

interest income of $23.0 million &#160;

was driven by higher yield &#160;

and volume on earning &#160;

assets partially offset by &#160;

the increase in the &#160;

cost 

of deposits, mainly from the P.R. public sector. &#160;

The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 83 basis points to 2.44% from 1.61% 

in the same quarter of 2023. Total &#160;

deposit costs for the quarter increased by 63 basis points, from &#160;

1.18% in the first quarter of 2023 

to 1.81%. 

Net interest income for PB was $84.9 million &#160;

for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared &#160;

to $90.1 million during the first 

quarter of 2023, a decrease of $5.2 million. &#160;

Net interest margin decreased 75 basis &#160;

points to 2.59% when compared to 3.34% 

&#160;

during the first quarter of 2023. The decrease &#160;

in net interest margin was mostly driven &#160;

by a higher cost of deposits in all categories, 

partially offset by the increase in loan volume and the repricing &#160;

of adjustable-rate loans driven by the changes &#160;

in interest rates. The 

cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.86% compared &#160;

to 2.47% in the first quarter of 2023, or an &#160;

increase of 139 basis points, while 

total deposit cost was 3.40% compared to 2.01% &#160;

in the first quarter of 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio &#160;

and Unfunded Commitments 

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

Corporation recorded &#160;

a provision &#160;

expense of &#160;

$72.1 million &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses related &#160;

to 

loans held-in-portfolio and &#160;

unfunded commitments. The provision &#160;

for credit loss &#160;

related to the &#160;

loans-held-in-portfolio for the &#160;

quarter 

ended March 31, &#160;

2024 was $72.4 &#160;

million, compared to a &#160;

provision expense of $47.1 &#160;

million for the &#160;

quarter ended March 31, &#160;

2023. 

The increase &#160;

in provision &#160;

expense was &#160;

driven by &#160;

the commercial &#160;

and consumer &#160;

portfolio, mainly &#160;

personal loans &#160;

and credit &#160;

cards. 

Higher &#160;

loan &#160;

volumes &#160;

and &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

credit &#160;

quality &#160;

in &#160;

these &#160;

portfolios &#160;

contributed &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

higher &#160;

provision &#160;

expense. &#160;

The &#160;

reserve 

release related &#160;

to unfunded &#160;

commitments for &#160;

the first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024 was &#160;

$0.2 million, &#160;

compared to &#160;

a provision &#160;

expense of &#160;

$0.6 

million for the same period of 2023. &#160;

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation recorded $61.0 million in &#160;

provision expense for loans-held-in-portfolio in the 

BPPR segment, compared to a provision expense of $45.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Popular U.S. segment 

recorded &#160;

a &#160;

provision expense &#160;

of &#160;

$11.4 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, &#160;

2024, compared &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

provision expense &#160;

of &#160;

$1.9 

million for the same quarter in 2023. 

At March 31, &#160;

2024, the total &#160;

allowance for credit &#160;

losses for loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio amounted to &#160;

$739.5 million, compared &#160;

to $729.3 

million as of December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses &#160;

to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.11% at March 31, 2024, 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

2.08% &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

As &#160;

in &#160;

Note &#160;

8 &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Consolidated &#160;

Financial Statements, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation 

applies probability weightings to the outcomes of simulations using Moody&#8217;s Analytics&#8217; Baseline, S3 (pessimistic) and S1 (optimistic) 

scenarios to &#160;

estimate the &#160;

ACL. The &#160;

baseline scenario &#160;

is assigned &#160;

the highest &#160;

probability, &#160;

followed by &#160;

the pessimistic &#160;

scenario to 

account for &#160;

uncertainties in &#160;

the macro-economic &#160;

outlook and &#160;

any downside &#160;

risk. The &#160;

weight assigned &#160;

to the &#160;

pessimistic scenario 

decreased this quarter in &#160;

response to the positive &#160;

momentum in the economy &#160;

as expectations for the &#160;

Federal Reserve achieving a 

soft &#160;

landing &#160;

have &#160;

improved. &#160;

Provision for Credit Losses &#8211; Investment Securities 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

provision &#160;

for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

investment &#160;

securities &#160;

held-to-maturity &#160;

is &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

of 

obligations from the &#160;

Government of Puerto &#160;

Rico, states and &#160;

political subdivisions. At March &#160;

31, 2024, the &#160;

total allowance for &#160;

credit 

losses &#160;

for &#160;

this &#160;

portfolio &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$5.7 &#160;

million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$5.8 &#160;

million &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

Refer &#160;

Note &#160;

to 

Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information on the ACL for this portfolio. 

During the quarter &#160;

ended March 31. &#160;

2024, the Corporation &#160;

recognized a provision &#160;

of $0.5 million &#160;

related to a &#160;

single security within 

the &#8220;Other&#8221; portfolio in its &#160;

debt securities available-for-sale, that after evaluation was determined to &#160;

be impaired and as a &#160;

result was 

fully reserved. Refer to Note 5 to Consolidated &#160;

Financial Statements for additional information on &#160;

the ACL for this portfolio. 

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

was &#160;

$163.8 million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2024, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$1.9 &#160;

million &#160;

when compared &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

same 

quarter of the previous year. The increase in non-interest income was primarily &#160;

driven by: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

service fees &#160;

by &#160;

$4.2 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher credit &#160;

card &#160;

fees, mainly &#160;

from commercial &#160;

clients, &#160;

higher 

debit &#160;

card &#160;

fees &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

higher interchange &#160;

transactional volumes, &#160;

and &#160;

higher investment &#160;

management and &#160;

trust 

fees; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher service charges on deposit accounts by $2.8 &#160;

million mainly due to higher non balance compensation, &#160;

mainly from 

commercial accounts; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income from mortgage banking activities by $3.0 million mainly due to an unfavorable variance of $2.1 &#160;

million in the 

fair value adjustment of mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) &#160;

and lower mortgage servicing fees. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024 &#160;

increased by &#160;

$42.4 million &#160;

when compared &#160;

with the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter of 

2023. Excluding &#160;

the $6.4 &#160;

million of &#160;

interest accrued &#160;

related to &#160;

prior period &#160;

taxes and &#160;

the $14.3 &#160;

million impact &#160;

of the &#160;

FDIC Special 

Assessment total expenses for the &#160;

first quarter of 2024 &#160;

were $462.4 million, compared to &#160;

$440.7 million in the first &#160;

quarter of 2023. 

The other factors that contributed to the variance in operating &#160;

expenses were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel cost &#160;

by $16.6 million &#160;

mainly due to &#160;

higher salaries expense &#160;

by $4.0 million &#160;

as a result &#160;

of annual salary 

revisions &#160;

that &#160;

occur &#160;

after the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

headcount throughout &#160;

2023, &#160;

an &#160;

increase in &#160;

health &#160;

insurance 

costs &#160;

by &#160;

$2.0 &#160;

million, &#160;

higher &#160;

annual &#160;

incentive &#160;

awards &#160;

of &#160;

performance &#160;

and &#160;

restricted &#160;

shares &#160;

related &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$3.4 

million, higher commissions and incentive compensation by $3.8 million, and higher payroll taxes and other compensation 

expenses by $3.2 million; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses by &#160;

$10.9 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

software amortization &#160;

expense by &#160;

$3.3 

million, an increase of $3.5 million from &#160;

network management services, and higher IT professional and consulting fees by 

$3.1 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher business &#160;

promotion expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$2.1 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher customer &#160;

rewards programs &#160;

expense in &#160;

our 

credit card business; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher net occupancy &#160;

expenses by $2.0 &#160;

million mainly due &#160;

to higher cleaning &#160;

costs and higher &#160;

amortization of buildings&#8217; 

insurance premiums; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other real estate owned (OREO) benefit by &#160;

$3.6 million mainly due to higher gain on &#160;

sale of mortgage properties; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional fees by $4.5 million mainly due &#160;

to lower advisory expenses related to corporate &#160;

initiatives; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower operational losses by $3.2 million mainly related &#160;

to legal settlements reserves; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other &#160;

taxes expense &#160;

by $1.9 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

lower accruals &#160;

in the &#160;

first quarter &#160;

of 2024 &#160;

related to &#160;

regulatory 

examination expenses.

Income Taxes 

For the quarter &#160;

ended March 31, &#160;

2024, the Corporation &#160;

recorded an income &#160;

tax expense of &#160;

$55.6 million with &#160;

an effective tax &#160;

rate 

(ETR) of 35%, &#160;

compared to $46.3 million with an ETR of 23% for the same period of 2023. &#160;

As discussed in Note 30, the income tax 

expense for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2024 &#160;

includes $23.0 &#160;

million related &#160;

to withholding &#160;

tax liabilities &#160;

for certain &#160;

intercompany 

distributions, &#160;

out &#160;

of &#160;

which $16.5 &#160;

million &#160;

was &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

distributions &#160;

between years &#160;

2014-2023 &#160;

and &#160;

$6.5 &#160;

million &#160;

was &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

a 

distribution completed during &#160;

the quarter ended &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024. This variance &#160;

was partially offset &#160;

due to lower &#160;

pre-tax income for 

the quarter ended March &#160;

31, 2024. &#160;

Also, for the &#160;

quarter ended March 31, &#160;

2023, the Corporation reported a &#160;

reversal of a &#160;

valuation 

allowance on a tax credit expected to be realized in the U. S. operations. Based on the Adjusted Net Income, as defined in the Non-

GAAP Financial Measures section of this &#160;

MD&#38;A, the ETR for the &#160;

quarter ended March 31, 2024, &#160;

would have been 24.7%. Refer to 

the Significant Events section in this MD&#38;A for more &#160;

details on Significant Events and Non-GAAP &#160;

Financial Measures. 

At &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, the &#160;

Corporation had &#160;

a net &#160;

deferred tax &#160;

asset amounting &#160;

to &#160;

$1.0 billion, &#160;

net of &#160;

a valuation &#160;

allowance of &#160;

$0.5 

billion. The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. &#160;

operations was $0.3 billion, net of a valuation &#160;

allowance of $0.4 billion.

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable segments &#160;

for managerial &#160;

reporting purposes &#160;

consist of &#160;

Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

Popular 

U.S. A Corporate group &#160;

has also been defined to support the reportable &#160;

segments. &#160;

&#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable &#160;

segments, &#160;

including &#160;

additional &#160;

financial &#160;

information &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

underlying 

management accounting process, refer to Note 32 &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

The Corporate group reported a net loss of $25.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared with a net income of &#160;

$1.3 

million for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The negative &#160;

variance was &#160;

mainly attributed &#160;

to the &#160;

$22.9 million &#160;

adjustment to 

recognize the &#160;

tax impact &#160;

associated with &#160;

prior period &#160;

intercompany distributions &#160;

and the &#160;

additional $6.5 &#160;

million recognized &#160;

for the 

tax impact related to intercompany distributions paid &#160;

during the first quarter of 2024. &#160;

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable &#160;

segments are discussed below: 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico &#160;

The Banco &#160;

Popular de &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

reportable segment&#8217;s &#160;

net income &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$121.3 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, 

2024, compared &#160;

with net &#160;

income of &#160;

$132.9 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The factors &#160;

that contributed &#160;

to the 

variance in the financial results included the following: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $23.0 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment &#160;

securities by $38.7 million due to higher yields driven 

by &#160;

the &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

average &#160;

balances &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury 

securities. 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by $71.2 million mainly &#160;

due to higher average balances from commercial and 

consumer loans, mainly from auto and consumer loans, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on deposits &#160;

by $86.8 million &#160;

mainly due to &#160;

higher costs on &#160;

the market-indexed Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, and &#160;

the &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact on &#160;

the cost &#160;

of &#160;

NOW accounts, 

time deposits, and savings deposits. 

The net &#160;

interest margin &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March &#160;

31, 2024 &#160;

was 3.33% &#160;

compared to &#160;

3.28% for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter in &#160;

the 

previous year. &#160;

The increase in &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

is driven by &#160;

the earnings assets &#160;

mix and the &#160;

higher yields from &#160;

investment 

securities and loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans, due to the increase in rates; partially offset by &#160;

higher cost of 

deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

A provision &#160;

for loan &#160;

losses expense of &#160;

$60.7 million, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision expense of &#160;

$45.7 million in &#160;

quarter ended 

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

or &#160;

an &#160;

unfavorable variance &#160;

of &#160;

$15.0 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

credit &#160;

quality &#160;

mostly &#160;

due &#160;

to 

consumer portfolios and higher volumes; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was lower by $1.8 million mainly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower &#160;

other &#160;

operating &#160;

income &#160;

by &#160;

$3.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mostly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

an &#160;

insurance policy &#160;

reimbursement gain &#160;

of &#160;

$7.0 

million recorded during the quarter ended March &#160;

31,2023; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income &#160;

from mortgage &#160;

banking activities &#160;

by $3.1 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

an unfavorable &#160;

variance of &#160;

$2.1 

million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service &#160;

rights. &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher service charges on deposit accounts by $2.9 &#160;

million mainly due to higher ACH fees. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher &#160;

other &#160;

service fees &#160;

by &#160;

$2.6 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher credit &#160;

card &#160;

fees &#160;

of &#160;

$1.1 million &#160;

as a &#160;

result &#160;

of 

higher interchange transactional volumes and an increase &#160;

of $1.1 million on trust fees; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $31.4 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher deposit insurance expense by $12.1 &#160;

million mostly due to the FDIC &#160;

Special Assessment recorded in the 

first quarter of 2024; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $11.4 million driven by higher compensations and incentives, annual salary revisions, 

and increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

software &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$7.6 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

network &#160;

management &#160;

fees, 

amortization of software costs and higher IT consulting &#160;

fees. 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

business &#160;

promotions &#160;

by &#160;

$2.2 &#160;

million &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

customer &#160;

rewards &#160;

expense &#160;

from &#160;

our &#160;

credit &#160;

cards 

portfolio related to higher transactional volumes; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher net recoveries from OREO by $3.7 million &#160;

mainly due to higher gain on sale of mortgage &#160;

properties; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other operating taxes by $2.1 &#160;

million mainly due to regulatory examination fees; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income tax expense by $13.6 million is mainly &#160;

due to a lower income before tax. &#160;

Popular U.S. 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported a net income of $7.0 million, compared with 

a net income &#160;

of $25.0 million for &#160;

the same quarter of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

The factors that contributed &#160;

to the variance &#160;

in the financial 

results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower &#160;

net interest income by $5.2 million due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$51.3 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

higher average 

balance of time deposits gathered through online &#160;

channels, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$26.4 million, &#160;

mainly from &#160;

growth in &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio as &#160;

well as 

higher yields due to increase in rates; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment securities by $18.1 &#160;

million due to higher volume and 

yields due to the increase in market rates. 

The net interest &#160;

margin for the &#160;

quarter ended March 31, &#160;

2024 was 2.59% compared &#160;

to 3.34% for &#160;

the same quarter in &#160;

the previous 

year driven by the higher cost of deposits. 

&#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

An &#160;

unfavorable &#160;

variance &#160;

of &#160;

$9.4 &#160;

million &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

provision &#160;

for &#160;

loan &#160;

losses &#160;

and &#160;

unfunded &#160;

commitments &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to 

changes in internal credit risk ratings in the commercial &#160;

loan portfolio; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $4.6 million mostly &#160;

due to: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher deposit insurance expense by $2.8 million &#160;

mostly due to FDIC Special Assessment adjustment; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating expense &#160;

by &#160;

$1.6 million &#160;

due to &#160;

higher charges &#160;

allocated from &#160;

the &#160;

Corporate segment 

group by $1.8 million mainly from higher personnel &#160;

costs. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS &#160;

Assets 

The Corporation&#8217;s total &#160;

assets were $70.9 billion &#160;

at March 31, &#160;

2024, compared to $70.8 &#160;

billion at December 31, &#160;

2023. Refer to the 

Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition included &#160;

in this report for additional information. &#160;

Money market investments and debt securities available-for-sale 

Money market investments decreased by $1.1 billion as &#160;

of March 31, 2024, when compared to &#160;

December 31, 2023, as these funds 

were used in &#160;

part for the &#160;

purchase of debt securities &#160;

and loan originations. &#160;

Debt securities available-for-sale increased &#160;

$1.3 billion, 

mainly due &#160;

to purchases &#160;

of U.S. &#160;

Treasury Securities, &#160;

while debt &#160;

securities held-to-maturity &#160;

decreased by &#160;

$111.1 &#160;

million driven &#160;

by 

maturities of &#160;

U.S. Treasury &#160;

securities, partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

the amortization &#160;

of $44.0 &#160;

million of &#160;

the discount &#160;

related to &#160;

U.S. Treasury 

securities previously reclassified from the &#160;

AFS to HTM. Refer &#160;

to Note 5 and &#160;

to Note 6 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements for 

additional information with respect to the Corporation&#8217;s debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity.

&#160;

Loans 

Refer to Table &#160;

5 for a &#160;

breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio. Also, refer &#160;

to Note 7 in &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements 

for detailed information about the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio &#160;

composition and loan purchases and sales. &#160;

Loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

increased by &#160;

$53.8 million &#160;

to $35.1 &#160;

billion as &#160;

of March &#160;

31, 2024, &#160;

compared to &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

as of 

December 31, 2023. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, &#160;

the BPPR portfolio increased by $123.8 million, driven by &#160;

the growth 

in &#160;

the mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

auto loans &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and the &#160;

PB &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

decreased by &#160;

$70.1 million, &#160;

due in &#160;

part by &#160;

commercial loans 

payoffs, offset by growth in the construction loans portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

$5.1 billion &#160;

non-owner occupied commercial &#160;

real estate &#160;

portfolio is comprised &#160;

of $3.0 &#160;

billion in &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

and 

$2.1 billion in the U.S. and is &#160;

well diversified across a number of tenants in different industries &#160;

and segments with exposure to retail 

(35% &#160;

of &#160;

non-owner &#160;

occupied &#160;

CRE), &#160;

hotels &#160;

(19%) &#160;

and &#160;

office &#160;

space &#160;

(12%) &#160;

accounting &#160;

for &#160;

two &#160;

thirds &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

total &#160;

exposure. &#160;

The 

approximate $633 million office space &#160;

exposure represents only 1.8% of &#160;

the total loan portfolio &#160;

and is comprised mainly of &#160;

mid-rise 

properties with diversified tenants with average loan &#160;

size of $2 million across both the U.S. and &#160;

Puerto Rico. 

Popular&#8217;s $2.4 billion commercial multi-family &#160;

portfolio represents approximately 7% of &#160;

total loans and is &#160;

concentrated in New York 

Metro ($1.4 billion), South Florida &#160;

($734 million) and Puerto Rico &#160;

($197 million). In the New &#160;

York Metro &#160;

region, the Corporation has 

no &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

rent &#160;

controlled &#160;

buildings. &#160;

The &#160;

majority &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

multi-family &#160;

loans &#160;

in &#160;

that &#160;

region &#160;

are &#160;

collateralized &#160;

by &#160;

underlying 

buildings that count on a mix &#160;

of units subject to rent stabilized (subject &#160;

to annual capped rent increases) and market-rate &#160;

units. The 

rent stabilized units represent less than 40% of the &#160;

total units in the loan portfolio with the &#160;

majority originated after 2019. The mix of 

units within &#160;

a building &#160;

is common &#160;

across the &#160;

New York &#160;

Metro region &#160;

2024, an increase of &#160;

$148.4 million, when compared to &#160;

Total Deposits 

The Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $63.8 billion as of &#160;

March 31, 2024, compared to $63.6 billion as &#160;

of December 31, 2023. The 

increase in the retail demand deposits, time deposits &#160;

and deposits in trust in BPPR, offset in part by &#160;

the decrease in P.R. public 

sector accounts were the main drivers of the $190.5 &#160;

million increase during the period. &#160;

P.R. &#160;

Public Sector Deposits 

As of March &#160;

31, 2024, the Puerto &#160;

Rico public sector &#160;

deposits amounted to $18.0 &#160;

billion, compared to $18.1 &#160;

billion as of &#160;

December 

31, 2023. 

Approximately 28% &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s deposits &#160;

as of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024 are &#160;

public fund &#160;

deposits from &#160;

the Government &#160;

of Puerto 

Rico, municipalities &#160;

and government instrumentalities &#160;

and corporations. P.R &#160;

public sector deposit &#160;

costs are &#160;

indexed to changes &#160;

in 

short-term market &#160;

rates with &#160;

a one-quarter &#160;

lag, in &#160;

accordance with &#160;

contractual terms. &#160;

As a &#160;

result, these &#160;

costs may &#160;

lag in &#160;

variable 

asset &#160;

repricing. &#160;

These &#160;

deposits &#160;

require &#160;

pledge &#160;

high &#160;

collateral; &#160;

therefore, &#160;

liquidity &#160;

risks 

arising from &#160;

public sector &#160;

deposit outflows &#160;

are lower. &#160;

this MD&#38;A &#160;

for additional &#160;

information on &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s funding sources. Fluctuations of public sector deposit balances are uncertain and difficult to predict. Factors that &#160;

could 

impact public &#160;

sector deposit &#160;

balances at &#160;

any given &#160;

period, include, &#160;

but are &#160;

not limited &#160;

to the &#160;

such &#160;

as

of &#160;

reductions &#160;

in &#160;

such &#160;

as, &#160;

the &#160;

speed &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

federal

distributed, the &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity and &#160;

As &#160;

the

be recognized over the &#160;

remainder of 

the three-year transition period. 

The increase in the common equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio, and total capital ratio as of March &#160;

31, 2024 as compared to 

December 31, 2023 was &#160;

mainly due to the &#160;

three months period earnings. The &#160;

decrease in leverage capital ratio &#160;

was mainly due to 

higher average &#160;

assets which are &#160;

impacted by zero-risk &#160;

weighted assets that &#160;

do not &#160;

have a significant &#160;

impact on &#160;

the risk-weighted 

assets, partially offset by the period earnings.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the &#160;

Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest &#160;

rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk &#160;

refers to the &#160;

risk of a &#160;

reduction in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital due &#160;

to changes in &#160;

the market valuation &#160;

of its assets &#160;

and/or 

liabilities. &#160;

Most of the assets &#160;

subject to market valuation risk &#160;

are debt securities classified as &#160;

available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 &#160;

and 6 to the 

Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements for &#160;

further information &#160;

on the &#160;

debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale &#160;

and &#160;

held-to-maturity portfolios. 

Debt securities classified &#160;

as available-for-sale amounted to &#160;

$18.0 billion as &#160;

of March 31, &#160;

2024. Other assets &#160;

subject to market &#160;

risk 

include loans held-for-sale, which amounted &#160;

to $5 million, mortgage &#160;

servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which &#160;

amounted to $115 &#160;

million, and 

securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted to $27 &#160;

million, as of March 31, 2024. &#160;

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject &#160;

to various categories of interest rate risk, &#160;

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 

option risks. &#160;

In managing &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk, management may &#160;

alter the &#160;

mix of &#160;

floating and &#160;

fixed rate &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, change 

pricing &#160;

schedules, &#160;

adjust &#160;

maturities &#160;

through &#160;

sales &#160;

and &#160;

purchases &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

and &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

derivative &#160;

contracts, 

among other alternatives. &#160;

Interest &#160;

rate &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

an &#160;

active &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

encompasses &#160;

monitoring &#160;

loan &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

flows &#160;

complemented &#160;

by 

investment and funding &#160;

activities. Effective management of &#160;

interest rate risk begins &#160;

with understanding the dynamic &#160;

characteristics 

of assets and &#160;

liabilities and determining the &#160;

appropriate rate risk position &#160;

given line of &#160;

business forecasts, management objectives, 

market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest &#160;

Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 

Economic Value &#160;

of Equity &#160;

(&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The &#160;

three methodologies &#160;

complement each &#160;

other and &#160;

are used &#160;

jointly in &#160;

the evaluation &#160;

of the 

Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII &#160;

simulation modeling is &#160;

prepared for a &#160;

five-year period, which &#160;

in conjunction with &#160;

the EVE analysis, &#160;

provides 

management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest &#160;

income simulation analysis &#160;

performed by legal &#160;

entity and on &#160;

a consolidated basis &#160;

is a &#160;

tool used &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation in 

estimating the &#160;

potential change &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

resulting from &#160;

hypothetical changes &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates. Sensitivity &#160;

analysis is 

calculated using a simulation model which incorporates &#160;

actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity &#160;

and interest yields or costs. &#160;

Management assesses &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk by &#160;

comparing various &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

under different &#160;

interest rate &#160;

scenarios that &#160;

differ in 

direction of interest &#160;

rate changes, the &#160;

degree of change &#160;

and the projected &#160;

shape of the &#160;

yield curve. For &#160;

example, the types &#160;

of rate 

scenarios processed during the &#160;

quarter include flat &#160;

rates, implied forwards, and &#160;

parallel and non-parallel rate &#160;

shocks. Management 

also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis &#160;

and prepayment risk exposures. &#160;

The asset &#160;

and liability &#160;

management group &#160;

performs validation &#160;

procedures on &#160;

various assumptions &#160;

used as &#160;

part of &#160;

the simulation 

analyses as well as validations &#160;

of results on a &#160;

monthly basis. In addition, the &#160;

model and processes used to &#160;

assess IRR are subject 

to independent validations according to the guidelines &#160;

established in the Model Governance and &#160;

Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII &#160;

simulations under interest rate &#160;

scenarios in which the &#160;

yield curve is assumed &#160;

to rise and &#160;

decline by 

the same magnitude &#160;

(parallel shifts). The &#160;

rate scenarios considered in &#160;

these market risk &#160;

simulations include instantaneous parallel 

changes of -100, -200, &#160;

+100, and +200 basis points &#160;

during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses &#160;

are based on 

many assumptions, &#160;

including that &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet remains &#160;

flat, the &#160;

relative levels &#160;

of market &#160;

interest rates &#160;

across all &#160;

yield curve 

points &#160;

and &#160;

indexes, &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

spreads, &#160;

loan &#160;

prepayments &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

elasticity. &#160;

Thus, &#160;

they &#160;

should &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

relied &#160;

upon &#160;

as 

indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not &#160;

contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in 

interest rates. Additionally, the Corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis 

related to &#160;

using different &#160;

rate indexes &#160;

for the &#160;

repricing of &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the effect &#160;

of pricing &#160;

lags which &#160;

may be 

contractual &#160;

or &#160;

due to &#160;

historical differences &#160;

in the &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

management responses &#160;

to &#160;

changes in &#160;

the rate &#160;

environment. By &#160;

their 

nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from &#160;

what may actually occur in the future. The 

following table presents the &#160;

results of the simulations &#160;

at March 31, 2024 &#160;

and December 31, 2023, &#160;

As of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, NII &#160;

simulations show &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

maintains a &#160;

neutral to &#160;

slightly asset &#160;

sensitive position that &#160;

marginally 

increased as compared to &#160;

the results as &#160;

of December 31, &#160;

2023. The primary &#160;

reasons for the &#160;

variation in sensitivity &#160;

are changes in 

balance sheet composition driven by an increase in short-term &#160;

U.S Treasury Bills (&#8220;T- &#160;

Bills&#8221;) partly offset by a reduction in &#160;

overnight 

Fed Funds and U.S &#160;

Treasury Notes (&#8220;T- &#160;

Notes&#8221;) on the asset side, combined &#160;

with a decrease in Puerto &#160;

Rico public sector deposits 

which &#160;

are &#160;

indexed &#160;

to &#160;

market &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

slightly &#160;

higher &#160;

non-interest &#160;

bearing &#160;

deposits. &#160;

These &#160;

results suggest &#160;

that &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s net &#160;

interest income sensitivity &#160;

are driven by &#160;

changes in the &#160;

composition of the &#160;

investment portfolio as &#160;

the term &#160;

bond 

portfolio &#160;

continues &#160;

to &#160;

run &#160;

off &#160;

and &#160;

get &#160;

reinvested, &#160;

together &#160;

with &#160;

excess &#160;

reserves, &#160;

in &#160;

short-term &#160;

investments &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

T-Bills. 

Additionally, variations in liability cost, primarily driven by Puerto Rico public sector deposits that represented $18.0 billion or 28% of 

deposits as of March 31, &#160;

2024, as well as changes &#160;

in the composition and mix &#160;

of deposits, also impact the sensitivity &#160;

profile. In the 

more extreme declining rate scenarios &#160;

net interest income would be &#160;

affected as the repricing &#160;

of short-term assets and variable rate 

loans slightly exceeds &#160;

the benefit in &#160;

cost reduction of &#160;

these deposits. In &#160;

rising rate scenarios, Popular&#8217;s &#160;

net interest income &#160;

is also 

impacted by its large proportion &#160;

of Puerto Rico public sector &#160;

deposit, however the repricing of assets &#160;

as they either reset &#160;

or mature 

lead to an increase in net interest income. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan and &#160;

investment portfolios &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

prepayment risk, &#160;

which results &#160;

from the &#160;

ability of &#160;

a third-party &#160;

to 

repay debt &#160;

obligations prior &#160;

to maturity. &#160;

Prepayment risk &#160;

also could &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on the &#160;

duration of &#160;

mortgage-backed 

securities &#160;

and &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

since &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

shorten &#160;

(or &#160;

lower &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

extend) &#160;

weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

engages in &#160;

trading activities &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

at its &#160;

subsidiaries, BPPR &#160;

and Popular &#160;

Securities. 

Popular Securities&#8217; &#160;

trading activities &#160;

consist primarily &#160;

of market-making &#160;

activities to &#160;

meet expected &#160;

customers&#8217; needs &#160;

related to &#160;

its 

retail brokerage business, &#160;

and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and &#160;

government sponsored securities with the objective of 

realizing gains &#160;

from expected &#160;

short-term price &#160;

movements. BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

trading activities consist &#160;

primarily of &#160;

holding U.S. &#160;

Government 

sponsored &#160;

mortgage-backed securities &#160;

classified &#160;

as &#160;

is &#160;

to &#160;

derive &#160;

spread &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

to &#160;

benefit &#160;

from &#160;

movements. In &#160;

addition, BPPR &#160;

uses forward &#160;

contracts or &#160;

TBAs to &#160;

hedge its &#160;

securitization pipeline. &#160;

Risks related &#160;

to variations &#160;

in 

interest rates &#160;

and market volatility &#160;

are hedged &#160;

with TBAs &#160;

that have &#160;

characteristics similar to &#160;

that of &#160;

the forecasted security &#160;

and its 

conversion timeline. 

At March 31, &#160;

2024, the Corporation held trading &#160;

securities with a fair &#160;

value of $27 &#160;

million, representing approximately 0.04% of &#160;

the

$0.4 million &#160;

for the &#160;

last week &#160;

in March &#160;

2024. VAR &#160;

models 

include &#160;

assumptions and &#160;

estimates thus &#160;

actual &#160;

results could &#160;

differ &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

outputs from &#160;

these &#160;

models &#160;

and &#160;

assumptions. Back-

testing is performed on model &#160;

results to compare actual results &#160;

against maximum estimated losses, in order &#160;

to evaluate model and 

assumptions accuracy. &#160;

In the opinion of management, the size and composition &#160;

of the trading portfolio does not represent &#160;

a significant source of market risk 

for the Corporation. 

Liquidity &#160;

The objective &#160;

of effective &#160;

liquidity management &#160;

is to &#160;

ensure that &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has sufficient &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

meet all &#160;

of its &#160;

financial 

obligations, finance &#160;

expected future &#160;

growth, &#160;

fund &#160;

planned capital &#160;

distributions and &#160;

maintain a &#160;

reasonable safety &#160;

margin for &#160;

cash 

needs under &#160;

both normal &#160;

and stressed market &#160;

conditions. The Board &#160;

of Directors &#160;

is responsible &#160;

for establishing the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tolerance for liquidity risk, &#160;

including approving relevant risk limits and &#160;

policies. The Board of &#160;

Directors has delegated the monitoring 

of &#160;

these risks &#160;

to &#160;

the Board&#8217;s &#160;

Risk Management &#160;

Committee and &#160;

the Asset/Liability &#160;

Management Committee. &#160;

The management &#160;

of 

liquidity &#160;

risk, &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

long-term &#160;

and &#160;

day-to-day &#160;

basis, &#160;

is &#160;

the &#160;

responsibility &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporate &#160;

Treasury &#160;

Division. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

Corporate &#160;

Treasurer &#160;

is &#160;

responsible &#160;

for &#160;

implementing &#160;

the &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

procedures &#160;

approved &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Board &#160;

of &#160;

Directors &#160;

and &#160;

for 

monitoring &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

liquidity &#160;

position &#160;

on &#160;

an &#160;

ongoing &#160;

basis. &#160;

Also, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporate &#160;

Treasury &#160;

Division coordinates &#160;

corporate 

wide &#160;

liquidity &#160;

management &#160;

strategies &#160;

and &#160;

activities &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

reportable &#160;

segments, &#160;

oversees &#160;

policy &#160;

breaches &#160;

and &#160;

manages &#160;

the 

escalation process. &#160;

The &#160;

Financial and &#160;

Operational Risk &#160;

Management Division &#160;

is &#160;

responsible for &#160;

the independent &#160;

monitoring and 

reporting of adherence with established policies. 

An &#160;

institution&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

may be &#160;

pressured if, &#160;

for example, &#160;

it experiences &#160;

a sudden &#160;

and unexpected &#160;

substantial cash &#160;

outflow due 

deposit &#160;

outflows, &#160;

whether due &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

loss &#160;

of confidence &#160;

by &#160;

depositors, or &#160;

other &#160;

reasons, including &#160;

exogenous events &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the 

COVID-19 pandemic, &#160;

a downgrading &#160;

of its &#160;

credit rating, &#160;

or some &#160;

other event &#160;

that causes &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

avoid exposure &#160;

to the 

institution. Factors &#160;

that the &#160;

Corporation does &#160;

not control, &#160;

such &#160;

as the &#160;

economic outlook, &#160;

adverse ratings &#160;

of its &#160;

principal markets, 

perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory &#160;

changes, could also affect its ability to obtain &#160;

funding. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

has adopted &#160;

policies and &#160;

limits to &#160;

monitor the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position and &#160;

that of &#160;

its banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, contingency funding &#160;

plans are used to &#160;

model various stress events &#160;

of different magnitudes and &#160;

affecting different time 

horizons that assist &#160;

management in evaluating &#160;

the size of &#160;

the liquidity buffers &#160;

needed if those &#160;

stress events &#160;

occur. However, &#160;

such 

models &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

predict &#160;

accurately &#160;

how &#160;

the &#160;

market &#160;

and &#160;

customers &#160;

might &#160;

react &#160;

to &#160;

every &#160;

event, &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

In &#160;

addition &#160;

to &#160;

traditional &#160;

the 

Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.0 billion in &#160;

outstanding balances at March 31, 

2024 (December 31, 2023 - &#160;

$1.1 billion). A detailed description of &#160;

Refer to Table 7 in this MD&#38;A section for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated &#160;

from a large base of 

consumer, corporate and &#160;

public sector customers. Core deposits &#160;

include certificates of deposit &#160;

under $250,000, all interest-bearing 

transactional deposit accounts, &#160;

non-interest bearing deposits, &#160;

and savings deposits. &#160;

Core deposits exclude &#160;

brokered deposits and 

certificates &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

2023. &#160;

Core &#160;

deposits 

financed 88% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at March &#160;

31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged &#160;

that can be used to raise funds under these &#160;

facilities. &#160;

During the first quarter of 2024 the Corporation had &#160;

no material incremental use of its available liquidity sources. At &#160;

March 31,2024, 

the Corporation&#8217;s available liquidity &#160;

increased to $20.4 billion &#160;

from $19.5 billion on &#160;

December 31, 2023. The liquidity &#160;

subsidiaries maintain &#160;

sufficient funding &#160;

capacity to &#160;

address large &#160;

increases in &#160;

funding requirements &#160;

such as &#160;

deposit 

outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

established &#160;

liquidity &#160;

guidelines &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to 

cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete &#160;

successfully in the marketplace for &#160;

deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 

factors, including pricing, service, convenience &#160;

and financial stability as &#160;

reflected by operating results and &#160;

financial condition, credit 

ratings (by &#160;

nationally recognized credit &#160;

rating agencies), customer &#160;

confidence, and &#160;

importantly, &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance coverage. 

Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured &#160;

(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 

the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposit with denominations of $250,000 and over at March 31, 2024 is presented in the

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

$1.6 &#160;

billion in &#160;

brokered &#160;

deposits &#160;

at &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2024, &#160;

which &#160;

financed &#160;

approximately &#160;

2% &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

total &#160;

assets 

(December 31, 2023 - &#160;

$1.7 billion and 2%, &#160;

respectively). &#160;

In the event that &#160;

any of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory 

capital &#160;

ratios fall &#160;

below those &#160;

required by &#160;

a &#160;

well-capitalized institution &#160;

or &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

capital &#160;

restrictions by &#160;

the &#160;

regulators, the 

Corporation would be &#160;

at risk that &#160;

such banking subsidiary &#160;

would not be &#160;

able to raise &#160;

or maintain brokered deposits &#160;

and could also 

face limitations &#160;

on the &#160;

rate paid &#160;

on deposits, &#160;

which may &#160;

hinder the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s ability &#160;

to effectively &#160;

compete in &#160;

its retail &#160;

markets 

and could affect its deposit raising efforts. &#160;

Deposits from the public sector represent an &#160;

important source of funds for the Corporation. &#160;

As of March 31, 2024, total &#160;

Puerto Rico 

public sector &#160;

deposits were &#160;

$18.0 billion, &#160;

compared to &#160;

$18.1 billion &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2023. &#160;

These deposits &#160;

require that &#160;

the bank 

pledges &#160;

high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public &#160;

sector deposit outflows are lower given 

that the bank &#160;

receives its collateral &#160;

in return. This, &#160;

now unpledged, collateral &#160;

can either be &#160;

financed via repurchase &#160;

agreements or 

sold &#160;

for &#160;

cash. &#160;

However, &#160;

timing &#160;

differences &#160;

between &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

outflow &#160;

and &#160;

when &#160;

the &#160;

bank &#160;

receives &#160;

its &#160;

collateral &#160;

may 

occur. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

uses fixed-rate &#160;

U.S. Treasury &#160;

debt securities &#160;

as collateral &#160;

that have &#160;

limited credit &#160;

risk, but &#160;

are 

nonetheless subject to market value risk based on &#160;

changes in the interest rate environment. &#160;

When interest rates increase, the value 

of this &#160;

collateral decreases and &#160;

could result in &#160;

the Corporation having &#160;

to provide additional &#160;

collateral to cover &#160;

the same amount &#160;

of 

deposit &#160;

liabilities. &#160;

This &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

could &#160;

reduce &#160;

unpledged &#160;

securities &#160;

otherwise &#160;

available &#160;

as &#160;

liquidity &#160;

sources &#160;

to &#160;

the 

Corporation. &#160;

As of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, management believes &#160;

that the &#160;

banking subsidiaries had &#160;

sufficient current &#160;

and projected liquidity &#160;

sources to 

meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, &#160;

as well as special needs &#160;

and off-balance sheet commitments, in the &#160;

ordinary course of 

business. &#160;

Management &#160;

also &#160;

believes &#160;

that &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2024 &#160;

its &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

current &#160;

and 

projected resources &#160;

to address &#160;

a stress &#160;

event. Although &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries have &#160;

historically been &#160;

able to &#160;

replace maturing 

deposits and advances, no assurance can &#160;

be given that they would &#160;

be able to replace those &#160;

funds in the future if &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s 

financial condition or general market conditions were &#160;

to deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s financial flexibility will be severely &#160;

constrained 

if the banking subsidiaries are unable to &#160;

maintain access to funding or if &#160;

adequate financing is not available to &#160;

accommodate future 

financing &#160;

needs &#160;

at &#160;

acceptable &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

have &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

margin &#160;

requirements &#160;

on 

repurchase &#160;

agreements &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

collateralized &#160;

affecting its &#160;

Finally, &#160;

to the &#160;

extent the &#160;

Corporation relies more &#160;

heavily on &#160;

more expensive 

funding sources in order to meet its future growth, revenues &#160;

may not increase in a manner that is proportionate to cover these &#160;

costs. 

In this case, the Corporation&#8217;s profitability would be adversely &#160;

effected. 

The Corporation &#160;

monitors uninsured &#160;

deposits under &#160;

applicable FDIC &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

monitors accounts 

with balances over $250,000. &#160;

While the Corporation has a &#160;

diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, &#160;

corporate and government 

clients, &#160;

asset sales, &#160;

facilities &#160;

available from 

affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. &#160;

Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries 

are subject to various regulatory limits &#160;

and authorization requirements that are further described &#160;

below and that may limit the &#160;

ability 

of those subsidiaries to act as a source of &#160;

funding to the BHCs. 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

uses &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

funds &#160;

The outstanding balance of notes &#160;

amounted to $593 million at &#160;

March 31, 2024 and &#160;

As indicated &#160;

March &#160;

of &#160;

2023. 

Additionally, the Corporation&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.62 per share or approximately &#160;

$45 million per quarter. 

The BHCs have in &#160;

the past borrowed in the &#160;

corporate debt market primarily to finance &#160;

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 

debt obligations. The issuance of corporate debt as &#160;

a source of funding is likely more &#160;

costly due to the fact that &#160;

two out of the three 

principal credit &#160;

rating agencies &#160;

rate the &#160;

Corporation below &#160;

&#8220;investment grade&#8221;, &#160;

which affects &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

cost &#160;

and ability &#160;

to 

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets. &#160;

Factors &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

control, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

economic &#160;

outlook, &#160;

interest &#160;

rate 

volatility, &#160;

inflation, disruptions in &#160;

the debt market, &#160;

among others, could &#160;

also affect &#160;

its ability to &#160;

obtain funding. The &#160;

Corporation has

or equity securities. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

include &#160;

internally &#160;

generated &#160;

cash &#160;

flows &#160;

from &#160;

operations, &#160;

loan 

sales, repurchase agreements, capital &#160;

injections and borrowed funds &#160;

from their direct &#160;

parent companies or the &#160;

holding companies. 

The principal uses of funds for the non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, &#160;

operational expenses and payment 

of dividends to the &#160;

BHCs. The liquidity needs &#160;

of the non-banking subsidiaries &#160;

are minimal since most &#160;

of them are &#160;

funded internally 

from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings &#160;

or capital contributions from their holding companies. &#160;

Dividends 

During the quarter ended March 31, &#160;

2024, the Corporation declared cash dividends of &#160;

$0.62 per common share outstanding ($44.8 

million in the &#160;

aggregate). The dividends for the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s Series A preferred &#160;

stock amounted to $0.4 &#160;

million. During the quarter 

ended March 31, 2024, the BHCs received dividends and distributions amounting to $150 million from BPPR, $50 million from PNA, 

$6 million from Popular Securities and $7 million from its &#160;

non-banking subsidiaries. &#160;

time &#160;

the 

transactions are consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. In 2023, BPPR became 

an &#160;

approved counterparty &#160;

in the &#160;

Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#160;

Standing Repo &#160;

Facility. &#160;

This &#160;

allows approved &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

participate in 

daily auctions &#160;

with the &#160;

Standing Repo &#160;

Facility for &#160;

up to &#160;

$500 billion &#160;

in aggregate &#160;

of overnight financing &#160;

using U.S. &#160;

Treasuries and 

Agency MBS as collateral. The Corporation&#8217;s unpledged debt securities amounted &#160;

to $ 6.1 billion at March 31, 2024 and $ 4.6 billion 

at December 31, 2023. A &#160;

substantial portion of these debt securities &#160;

could be used to &#160;

raise financing in the U.S. &#160;

money markets or 

from secured lending sources, subject to changes in &#160;

their fair market value and customary adjustments (haircuts). &#160;

Additional liquidity may &#160;

be provided through &#160;

loan maturities, prepayments &#160;

and sales. The &#160;

loan portfolio can &#160;

also be used &#160;

to obtain 

funding in the capital markets. In particular, &#160;

mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have &#160;

secondary markets which the 

Corporation could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments 

&#160;

&#160;

In the ordinary course &#160;

of business, the Corporation &#160;

engages in financial transactions that &#160;

are not recorded on &#160;

the balance sheet or 

may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 

provider of &#160;

financial services, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

routinely enters &#160;

into commitments &#160;

with off-balance &#160;

sheet risk &#160;

to meet &#160;

the financial 

needs of &#160;

its customers. These &#160;

commitments may include &#160;

loan commitments and &#160;

standby letters of &#160;

credit. These commitments &#160;

are 

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

These &#160;

instruments &#160;

involve, &#160;

to 

varying degrees, elements &#160;

of credit and &#160;

interest rate risk &#160;

in excess of &#160;

the amount recognized &#160;

in the statement &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

a 

guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct &#160;

payment of the required amounts to the &#160;

holders of the applicable capital securities or 

by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions 

by &#160;

liabilities in the same manner &#160;

as the applicable debentures as &#160;

set 

forth in the applicable indentures&#894; and equally with all other guarantees &#160;

that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee 

of &#160;

payment &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

of &#160;

collection, &#160;

which means &#160;

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the obligor &#160;

Risks to Liquidity &#160;

Total lines of credit outstanding, or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily &#160;

a measure of the total credit 

available &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

continuing &#160;

basis. &#160;

These &#160;

lines &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements, &#160;

changes &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

collateral, 

standards of &#160;

creditworthiness, leverage ratios &#160;

and other &#160;

regulatory requirements, among &#160;

other factors. &#160;

Derivatives, such &#160;

as those 

embedded &#160;

in &#160;

long-term &#160;

repurchase &#160;

transactions &#160;

or &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

swaps, &#160;

and &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

exposures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

recourse, 

&#160;

performance bonds or &#160;

credit card &#160;

arrangements, are subject &#160;

to collateral requirements. &#160;

As their &#160;

fair value &#160;

increases, the collateral 

requirements may increase, thereby reducing the &#160;

balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

market for the &#160;

Corporation is an &#160;

additional risk factor &#160;

that could affect &#160;

its financing activities. &#160;

In 

the case &#160;

of a &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

the outlook &#160;

and/or credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

its principal &#160;

markets and/or &#160;

due to &#160;

regulatory changes &#160;

and fiscal 

conditions in &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

that are &#160;

outside the &#160;

control of &#160;

the Corporation, &#160;

the credit &#160;

quality of &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

could be &#160;

adversely 

affected and result in higher credit costs. These adverse events &#160;

could also affect the Corporation&#8217;s ability to obtain funding. 

To &#160;

plan for the possibility of &#160;

such a scenario, management adopted contingency &#160;

plans to address events that could &#160;

limit or partially 

limit important &#160;

sources of &#160;

funds that &#160;

are usually &#160;

fully available &#160;

for use. &#160;

These plans &#160;

call for &#160;

using alternate &#160;

funding mechanisms, 

such as the &#160;

pledging of certain &#160;

asset classes and accessing &#160;

secured credit lines &#160;

and loan facilities &#160;

put in place &#160;

with the FHLB &#160;

and 

the &#160;

FRB. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

is subject &#160;

to &#160;

positive tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements to &#160;

utilize secured &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

with the &#160;

FHLB that 

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

limitation &#160;

of &#160;

borrowing &#160;

amounts &#160;

or &#160;

maturity &#160;

terms, &#160;

even &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

exceeds &#160;

well-capitalized &#160;

regulatory 

capital levels. &#160;

The credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

Popular&#8217;s debt &#160;

obligations are &#160;

a relevant &#160;

factor for &#160;

liquidity because &#160;

they impact &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to 

borrow &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets, &#160;

its &#160;

cost &#160;

and &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

sources. &#160;

Credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

strength, &#160;

credit 

quality and &#160;

concentrations in &#160;

the loan &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

level and &#160;

volatility of &#160;

earnings, capital &#160;

adequacy, &#160;

the quality &#160;

of management, 

geographic concentration &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico, the &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet, the &#160;

availability of &#160;

a significant &#160;

base of &#160;

core retail &#160;

and 

commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access &#160;

a broad array of wholesale funding sources, &#160;

among other factors. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

various &#160;

statutory &#160;

provisions &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

dividends &#160;

an &#160;

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

pay &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

holding 

company without &#160;

regulatory approval. A &#160;

member bank must &#160;

obtain the &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

for any &#160;

dividend, if 

the total of all dividends declared by the member &#160;

bank during the calendar year would exceed &#160;

the combined net income for that year 

and the retained net income for &#160;

the preceding two years, net of &#160;

those years&#8217; dividend activity, &#160;

less any required transfers to surplus 

or to a &#160;

fund for the &#160;

retirement of any &#160;

preferred stock. In &#160;

addition, a member &#160;

bank may not &#160;

declare or pay &#160;

a dividend in &#160;

an amount 

greater &#160;

than &#160;

its &#160;

undivided &#160;

profits &#160;

as &#160;

reported &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

Report &#160;

of &#160;

Condition and &#160;

Income, &#160;

unless &#160;

the &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

has &#160;

received &#160;

the 

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. A &#160;

member bank also &#160;

may not permit &#160;

any portion of &#160;

its permanent capital &#160;

to be &#160;

withdrawn 

unless the withdrawal has been approved by &#160;

the Federal Reserve Board. The ability of &#160;

a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to 

its BHC &#160;

could thus &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by its &#160;

financial performance &#160;

and capital, &#160;

including tangible &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

capital, thus &#160;

potentially 

limiting the &#160;

amount of &#160;

cash moving &#160;

up to &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

from &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries. This &#160;

could, &#160;

in turn, &#160;

affect &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

ability to 

declare &#160;

dividends &#160;

on &#160;

its &#160;

outstanding &#160;

common &#160;

and &#160;

preferred &#160;

stock, &#160;

repurchase &#160;

its &#160;

securities &#160;

or &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

debt &#160;

obligations, &#160;

for 

example. 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, BPPR declared cash dividends &#160;

of $150 million to PIHC. As of March 31, 2024, BPPR can 

declare a &#160;

dividend of &#160;

approximately $410 &#160;

million without &#160;

prior approval &#160;

of the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Board due &#160;

to its &#160;

retained income, 

declared &#160;

dividend &#160;

activity &#160;

and &#160;

transfers &#160;

to &#160;

statutory &#160;

reserves &#160;

over the &#160;

measurement &#160;

period. &#160;

Pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

requirements &#160;

listed 

above, PB &#160;

may &#160;

not declare &#160;

or &#160;

pay &#160;

a dividend &#160;

without the &#160;

prior approval &#160;

of the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Board and &#160;

the &#160;

New York &#160;

State 

Department of Financial Services. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not &#160;

used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, &#160;

and 

therefore are less sensitive to the level and &#160;

changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Refer to the &#160;

Geographic and Government Risk section &#160;

of this MD&#38;A for &#160;

some highlights on the &#160;

status of the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy 

and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

currently &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

issue &#160;

unsecured &#160;

senior &#160;

debt, &#160;

as &#160;

these &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

funded 

primarily with &#160;

deposits and &#160;

secured borrowings. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries had &#160;

$7.8 million &#160;

in deposits &#160;

at March &#160;

31, 2024 &#160;

that are 

subject to rating triggers. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

certain mortgage servicing &#160;

and custodial agreements &#160;

that BPPR &#160;

has with &#160;

third parties &#160;

include rating covenants. &#160;

In the 

event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 

escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels &#160;

securing the recourse obligations. &#160;

As discussed &#160;

in Note &#160;

19 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements, the Corporation &#160;

services residential mortgage &#160;

loans subject &#160;

to 

credit &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions. &#160;

Certain &#160;

contractual &#160;

agreements &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

collateral &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

such &#160;

recourse 

obligations if &#160;

the institution&#8217;s &#160;

required credit &#160;

ratings are &#160;

not maintained. &#160;

Collateral pledged &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation to &#160;

secure recourse 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

obligations &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

approximately &#160;

$25.2 &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

additional

it would be &#160;

able to meet &#160;

additional collateral requirements if &#160;

and when 

needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s 

liquidity resources and impact its operating results.

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of &#160;

our financial &#160;

activities and &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure is &#160;

concentrated in &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

(&#8220;Puerto 

Rico&#8221;), which has faced severe economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the past and may face additional &#160;

challenges in the future. &#160;

Economic Performance. &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy suffered &#160;

a &#160;

severe and &#160;

prolonged recession &#160;

from &#160;

2007 &#160;

to &#160;

2017, &#160;

with real &#160;

gross national &#160;

product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) 

contracting approximately 15% &#160;

during this period. &#160;

In 2017, Hurricane &#160;

Mar&#237;a caused significant &#160;

damage and destruction &#160;

across the 

island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in &#160;

part aided by 

the large amount &#160;

of federal disaster &#160;

relief and recovery &#160;

assistance funds injected &#160;

into the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy in &#160;

connection with 

Hurricane Mar&#237;a &#160;

and other &#160;

recent natural &#160;

disasters. This &#160;

growth was &#160;

interrupted by &#160;

the economic &#160;

shock caused &#160;

by the &#160;

COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part &#160;

aided by additional federal assistance from &#160;

pandemic-related stimulus measures.

of ongoing economic &#160;

activity 

but &#160;

not &#160;

a &#160;

measurement of &#160;

real &#160;

GNP. &#160;

The &#160;

Puerto &#160;

estimates that &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

real &#160;

GNP &#160;

grew &#160;

0.7% 

during fiscal year 2023 (July 2022-June 2023) &#160;

and projects 2.8% real GNP growth for fiscal &#160;

year 2024 (July 2023-June-2024). 

While the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy has &#160;

not directly &#160;

tracked the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy in &#160;

recent years, &#160;

many of &#160;

the external &#160;

factors 

that impact &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

are affected &#160;

by the &#160;

policies and performance &#160;

of the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy. &#160;

These external 

factors include &#160;

the level &#160;

of interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

the rate &#160;

of inflation. &#160;

Inflation in &#160;

the United &#160;

States, as &#160;

measured by the &#160;

United States 

Consumer Price Index (published by the U.S. &#160;

Bureau of Labor Statistics), increased 3.5% during &#160;

the 12-month period ended March 

2024. &#160;

Inflation in Puerto Rico, &#160;

as measured by the &#160;

Puerto Rico Consumer Price &#160;

Index (published by the &#160;

Department of Labor and 

Human Resources of Puerto Rico), increased 1.9% during the 12-month period ended February 2024. The rate of inflation gradually 

decreased from a mid-2022 peak, as the Federal Reserve &#160;

implemented a series of benchmark interest &#160;

rate increases. &#160;

Fiscal Challenges. &#160;

As the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy contracted, the &#160;

government&#8217;s public &#160;

debt rose &#160;

rapidly, &#160;

in part &#160;

from borrowing to &#160;

cover deficits &#160;

to pay 

debt service, &#160;

pension benefits and &#160;

other government expenditures. &#160;

By 2016, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government had &#160;

over $120 &#160;

billion in 

combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had &#160;

lost access to the capital markets, and was in &#160;

the midst of a fiscal crisis. 

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

escalating fiscal &#160;

and economic &#160;

challenges &#160;

and imminent &#160;

widespread defaults &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

public debt &#160;

prompted the &#160;

U.S. 

Congress to &#160;

enact the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Oversight, Management, &#160;

and Economic &#160;

Stability Act &#160;

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in &#160;

June 2016. &#160;

PROMESA 

created the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; with ample powers over Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 

instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, &#160;

&#8220;PR Government Entities&#8221;). Pursuant &#160;

to PROMESA, the &#160;

Oversight Board will be &#160;

in 

place &#160;

until &#160;

market &#160;

access &#160;

is &#160;

restored &#160;

and &#160;

balanced &#160;

budgets &#160;

are &#160;

produced &#160;

for &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

four &#160;

consecutive &#160;

years. &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

also 

established two &#160;

mechanisms for &#160;

the restructuring &#160;

of the &#160;

obligations of &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities: (a) &#160;

Title III, &#160;

which provides &#160;

an in-

court process that incorporates many of the &#160;

powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &#160;

and permits adjustment of a broad 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

range of obligations, and &#160;

(b) Title VI, &#160;

which provides for a &#160;

largely out-of-court process through which &#160;

modifications to financial debt 

can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors &#160;

and bind holdouts. 

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several &#160;

of its instrumentalities have availed themselves &#160;

of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 

III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 

including &#160;

Government &#160;

Development &#160;

Bank &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Sales &#160;

Tax &#160;

Financing &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

Highways &#160;

and &#160;

Transportation &#160;

Authority, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Industrial &#160;

Development &#160;

Company, &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

completed &#160;

debt 

restructurings &#160;

under &#160;

Titles &#160;

III &#160;

or &#160;

VI &#160;

of &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

While &#160;

the &#160;

majority &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debt &#160;

has &#160;

already &#160;

been &#160;

restructured, &#160;

some &#160;

PR 

Government &#160;

Entities &#160;

still &#160;

face &#160;

significant &#160;

fiscal &#160;

challenges. &#160;

For &#160;

example, &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Electric &#160;

Power &#160;

Authority &#160;

is &#160;

still &#160;

in &#160;

the 

process of restructuring its debts under Title III of PROMESA. 

Municipalities. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges have &#160;

also adversely impacted its municipalities. Budgetary subsidies to municipalities 

have &#160;

gradually declined &#160;

in recent &#160;

years &#160;

and &#160;

were scheduled &#160;

to &#160;

be ultimately &#160;

eliminated by &#160;

fiscal year &#160;

2025 &#160;

as &#160;

part &#160;

of the &#160;

fiscal 

measures required &#160;

by &#160;

the Oversight &#160;

Board. However, &#160;

over the &#160;

past &#160;

years, the &#160;

Oversight Board &#160;

has &#160;

authorized and &#160;

funded &#160;

new 

appropriations &#160;

and &#160;

investments &#160;

to &#160;

offset &#160;

the &#160;

decline &#160;

in &#160;

intergovernmental &#160;

transfers &#160;

to &#160;

municipalities. &#160;

Beyond &#160;

those &#160;

sources &#160;

of 

alternate funding, municipalities have &#160;

also received significant federal &#160;

disaster and COVID-relief funding in &#160;

recent years. According 

to the &#160;

latest Puerto &#160;

Rico fiscal &#160;

plan certified &#160;

by the &#160;

Oversight Board, &#160;

taken together, &#160;

the funding &#160;

available to &#160;

municipalities in &#160;

the 

near-term is substantial. The fiscal &#160;

plan notes, however, that &#160;

the desired progress to achieve &#160;

fiscal discipline and implement critical 

reforms has not been achieved, &#160;

and that municipalities must work with &#160;

the Executive branch to analyze &#160;

the financial needs of &#160;

each 

individual municipality and focus on the necessary enhancements in municipal shared services &#160;

and other municipal and government 

initiatives. Pursuant to &#160;

the fiscal plan, &#160;

once the transformational measures &#160;

and milestones related to &#160;

these initiatives are &#160;

achieved, 

additional funding from the central government may be &#160;

made available to municipalities to improve fiscal &#160;

sustainability. 

Municipalities &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

and, &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board&#8217;s &#160;

request, &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

submit &#160;

fiscal &#160;

plans &#160;

and &#160;

annual 

budgets &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

for &#160;

its &#160;

review &#160;

and &#160;

approval. &#160;

They &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

required to &#160;

seek &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

approval &#160;

to &#160;

issue, 

guarantee &#160;

or &#160;

modify &#160;

their &#160;

debts &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

contracts &#160;

with an &#160;

aggregate &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

$10 &#160;

million &#160;

or &#160;

more. &#160;

With &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight 

Board&#8217;s approval, municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. To 

date, however, no municipality has been subject to any such debt &#160;

restructuring process. 

Exposure of the Corporation &#160;

The credit &#160;

quality of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

reflects, among other &#160;

things, the &#160;

general economic conditions &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

other 

adverse conditions affecting Puerto &#160;

Rico consumers and businesses. &#160;

Deterioration in the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy has resulted &#160;

in the 

past, and could &#160;

result in the future, &#160;

in higher delinquencies, greater &#160;

charge-offs and increased losses, &#160;

which could materially affect 

our financial condition and results of operations. &#160;

At March &#160;

31, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

to PR &#160;

Government Entities &#160;

totaled $388 &#160;

million, of &#160;

which $363 &#160;

million were 

outstanding, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$362 million &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023, of &#160;

which $333 &#160;

million &#160;

were outstanding. &#160;

A &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

Puerto 

Rico&#8217;s fiscal and &#160;

economic situation could adversely &#160;

affect the value &#160;

of our Puerto &#160;

Rico government obligations, resulting &#160;

in losses 

to &#160;

us. &#160;

Of &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

outstanding, &#160;

$348 &#160;

million &#160;

consists &#160;

of &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

$16 &#160;

million &#160;

are &#160;

securities &#160;

($314 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

$19 &#160;

million, 

respectively, &#160;

at &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023). &#160;

Substantially &#160;

all &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure &#160;

outstanding at &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2024 &#160;

were 

obligations from various &#160;

Puerto Rico municipalities. &#160;

In most &#160;

cases, these were &#160;

&#8220;general obligations&#8221; of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to which &#160;

the 

applicable municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged its &#160;

good faith, &#160;

credit &#160;

and unlimited &#160;

taxing &#160;

power, &#160;

or &#8220;special &#160;

obligations&#8221; of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to 

which the applicable municipality has pledged basic &#160;

property tax or sales tax revenues. At March 31, 2024, &#160;

78% of the Corporation&#8217;s 

exposure to &#160;

municipal loans &#160;

and securities &#160;

was concentrated &#160;

in the &#160;

municipalities of &#160;

San Juan, &#160;

Guaynabo, Carolina &#160;

and Caguas. 

For &#160;

additional &#160;

discussion &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and 

municipalities, refer to Note 20 &#8211; Commitments and &#160;

Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements. &#160;

In addition, at March &#160;

31, 2024, the Corporation had &#160;

$233 million in loans &#160;

insured or securities issued by &#160;

Puerto Rico governmental 

entities, but for &#160;

which the principal source &#160;

of repayment is &#160;

non-governmental ($238 million at December 31, 2023). &#160;

These included 

$187 million in &#160;

residential mortgage loans insured &#160;

by the Puerto &#160;

Rico Housing Finance Authority &#160;

(&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a &#160;

PR Government Entity 

(December 31, 2023 - $191 million). These mortgage loans are secured &#160;

by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and 

the &#160;

HFA &#160;

insurance &#160;

covers &#160;

losses &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

event &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

borrower &#160;

default &#160;

and &#160;

upon &#160;

the &#160;

satisfaction &#160;

of &#160;

certain &#160;

other &#160;

conditions. &#160;

The 

Corporation also &#160;

had &#160;

at &#160;

March &#160;

31, 2024, &#160;

$39 &#160;

million &#160;

in bonds &#160;

issued by &#160;

HFA &#160;

which &#160;

are secured &#160;

by &#160;

second &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans on 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to &#160;

cover losses in the event of a borrower default, and 

upon the satisfaction of certain &#160;

other conditions (December 31, 2023 - $40 &#160;

million). In the event that &#160;

the mortgage loans insured by 

HFA and held &#160;

by the Corporation directly or those serving &#160;

as collateral for the HFA &#160;

bonds default and the collateral is &#160;

insufficient to 

satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s &#160;

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial 

condition &#160;

of &#160;

HFA &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

such &#160;

obligations &#160;

become &#160;

due &#160;

and &#160;

payable. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

consider &#160;

the &#160;

government 

guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated &#160;

with this portfolio. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio also &#160;

includes loans &#160;

to &#160;

private borrowers &#160;

who &#160;

are service &#160;

providers, lessors, &#160;

suppliers or &#160;

have 

other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively &#160;

affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and &#160;

economic 

situation &#160;

of &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities. &#160;

Similarly, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

government 

employees &#160;

and &#160;

retirees, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

be &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

employee &#160;

layoffs &#160;

or &#160;

furloughs &#160;

or 

reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic &#160;

situation deteriorates. 

As of March 31, 2024, BPPR had $18.0 billion in deposits from the Puerto Rico government, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. 

The &#160;

rate &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

public &#160;

deposit &#160;

balances &#160;

may &#160;

decline is &#160;

uncertain and &#160;

difficult &#160;

to &#160;

predict. &#160;

The &#160;

amount &#160;

and &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

any &#160;

such 

reduction is &#160;

likely to &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for example, &#160;

the speed &#160;

at which &#160;

federal assistance &#160;

is distributed &#160;

and the &#160;

financial condition, 

liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, &#160;

as well as on the ability of BPPR to &#160;

maintain these customer relationships. 

The &#160;

Corporation may &#160;

also have &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure with &#160;

regards to &#160;

avoidance and &#160;

other causes &#160;

of &#160;

action initiated &#160;

by the &#160;

Oversight 

Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 20

Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;USVI&#8221;) &#160;

and &#160;

has &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

USVI &#160;

government 

entities. 

The USVI has &#160;

been experiencing a &#160;

number of fiscal &#160;

and economic challenges, &#160;

which could adversely &#160;

affect the &#160;

ability of its &#160;

public 

corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding &#160;

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI &#160;

and, as such, 

there &#160;

is &#160;

currently &#160;

no &#160;

federal &#160;

legislation &#160;

permitting &#160;

the &#160;

restructuring &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debts &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

USVI &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

public &#160;

corporations &#160;

and 

instrumentalities. 

To &#160;

the extent that &#160;

the fiscal condition &#160;

of the USVI &#160;

continues to deteriorate, the &#160;

U.S. Congress or the &#160;

Government of the &#160;

USVI may 

enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the &#160;

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a &#160;

stay on creditor 

remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable &#160;

to the USVI. 

At March &#160;

31, 2024, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

had approximately &#160;

$28 million &#160;

in direct &#160;

exposure to &#160;

USVI government &#160;

entities (December 31, 

2023 - $28 million). &#160;

British Virgin Islands 

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

operations &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

British Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(&#8220;BVI&#8221;), &#160;

which &#160;

was &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected by &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic, 

particularly as &#160;

a reduction &#160;

in the &#160;

tourism activity &#160;

which accounts &#160;

for a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of its &#160;

economy. &#160;

Although the &#160;

Corporation 

has no &#160;

significant exposure to &#160;

a single &#160;

borrower in the &#160;

BVI, at &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, it &#160;

has a &#160;

loan portfolio amounting &#160;

to approximately 

$208 million comprised of various retail and commercial &#160;

clients, compared to a loan portfolio of $205 million &#160;

at December 31, 2023. 

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes &#160;

5 and 6 to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s investment 

securities &#160;

represented exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Government in &#160;

the &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

agency 

mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.9 billion of residential mortgages, and $92.4 million commercial loans 

were insured or guaranteed by &#160;

the U.S. Government or its &#160;

agencies at March 31, 2024 &#160;

(compared to $1.9 billion and &#160;

$89.2 million, 

respectively, at December 31, 2023).

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) &#160;

include primarily past-due &#160;

loans that &#160;

are no &#160;

longer accruing interest, &#160;

renegotiated loans, and &#160;

real 

estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit &#160;

quality metrics, is presented in Table 18. 

During &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2024, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

reflected &#160;

stable &#160;

credit &#160;

quality &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

previous &#160;

quarter. &#160;

Non-

performing loans &#160;

(&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) and &#160;

net charge &#160;

offs (&#8220;NCOs&#8221;) &#160;

remained below &#160;

historical averages &#160;

and delinquencies &#160;

improved in &#160;

most 

loan categories from the prior quarter. &#160;

We continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower 

performance &#160;

given &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

inflationary &#160;

pressures. &#160;

However, &#160;

management believes &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

improvements over 

recent years &#160;

in risk &#160;

management practices &#160;

and the &#160;

risk profile &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s loan &#160;

portfolios position &#160;

Popular to &#160;

continue to 

operate successfully under the current challenging &#160;

environment. 

Total &#160;

NPAs &#160;

as of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024 decreased &#160;

by $3 &#160;

million when &#160;

compared with &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. Total &#160;

non-performing loans 

held-in-portfolio &#160;

(&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$3 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$30 &#160;

million, &#160;

broadly 

reflected &#160;

across most &#160;

loan categories. &#160;

The commercial &#160;

NPLs decrease &#160;

includes a &#160;

$5.1 million &#160;

charge-off &#160;

related to &#160;

a &#160;

previously 

reserved $18 &#160;

million relationship. Popular &#160;

US NPLs &#160;

increased by &#160;

$27 million, &#160;

driven by &#160;

a $17 &#160;

million increase &#160;

in mortgage &#160;

NPLs, 

impacted by a single loan. The Corporation has no &#160;

other credit exposure to this borrower. &#160;

On March 31, &#160;

2024 , the &#160;

ratio of NPLs &#160;

to total loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio was 1.0%, &#160;

flat when compared &#160;

to December 31, &#160;

2023. Other 

real &#160;

estate &#160;

owned &#160;

loans &#160;

(&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) &#160;

remained &#160;

flat &#160;

from &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

On &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2024, &#160;

NPLs &#160;

secured &#160;

by &#160;

real &#160;

estate 

amounted to $211 million in &#160;

the Puerto Rico operations and $49 million in Popular U.S, compared with $231 million and $24 &#160;

million, 

respectively, on December 31, 2023. 

The Corporation&#8217;s commercial loan &#160;

portfolio secured by real &#160;

estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) amounted to &#160;

$10.6 billion on &#160;

March 31, 2024, &#160;

of which 

$3.1 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, &#160;

compared with $10.6 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, on December 31, 

2023. Office space &#160;

leasing exposure in &#160;

our non-owner occupied &#160;

CRE portfolio is &#160;

limited, representing only &#160;

1.8% or $633 &#160;

million of 

our total loan portfolio. &#160;

The exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with average &#160;

loan size of $2.0 million and is 

well diversified across tenant type. 

CRE NPLs amounted to $49 million on March 31, &#160;

2024, compared with $48 million on December 31, 2023. The CRE NPL &#160;

ratios for 

the BPPR and Popular U.S. &#160;

segments were 0.72% and 0.26%, &#160;

respectively, on March &#160;

31, 2024, compared with 0.86% and &#160;

0.13%, 

respectively, on December 31, 2023. 

In addition &#160;

to the &#160;

NPLs included &#160;

in Table &#160;

18, on &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2024, there were &#160;

$513 million &#160;

of performing &#160;

loans, mostly &#160;

commercial 

loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2023 

- $510 million). 

For the quarter &#160;

ended March 31, &#160;

2024, total inflows &#160;

of NPLs held-in-portfolio, &#160;

excluding consumer loans, &#160;

increased by $10 &#160;

million, 

when compared to the inflows for the same period &#160;

in 2023. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the &#160;

BPPR segment decreased by $17 

million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

period &#160;

in &#160;

2023, &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

commercial &#160;

and &#160;

mortgage &#160;

inflows &#160;

by &#160;

$12 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

$5 

million, respectively. Inflows of &#160;

NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. segment increased by $27 million &#160;

from the same period in 

2023, mainly driven by higher mortgage and &#160;

commercial inflows by $17 million and $9 &#160;

million, respectively.

Loan Delinquencies 

Another key measure used to evaluate and &#160;

monitor the Corporation&#8217;s asset quality is loan &#160;

delinquencies. Loans delinquent 30 days 

or more, as a percentage of their related portfolio &#160;

category on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, &#160;

Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes $0.4 billion &#160;

of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed &#160;

by the VA as of March &#160;

2024 (December 31, 2023 - $0.5 billion). Refer to Note &#160;

7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional &#160;

information of guaranteed loans. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The ACL, &#160;

represents management&#8217;s &#160;

estimate of &#160;

expected credit &#160;

losses through &#160;

the remaining &#160;

contractual life &#160;

of the &#160;

different loan 

segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL &#160;

is maintained at a sufficient &#160;

level to provide for estimated credit &#160;

losses &#160;

on 

collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified &#160;

for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder &#160;

of the loan 

portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

management evaluates the adequacy &#160;

of the ACL &#160;

on a quarterly &#160;

basis. In this &#160;

evaluation, management 

considers current &#160;

conditions, macroeconomic &#160;

economic expectations through &#160;

a reasonable &#160;

and supportable &#160;

period, historical &#160;

loss 

experience, &#160;

portfolio composition &#160;

by &#160;

loan &#160;

type &#160;

and &#160;

risk &#160;

characteristics, &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

periodic credit &#160;

reviews &#160;

of &#160;

individual &#160;

loans, &#160;

and 

regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

The Corporation must rely on &#160;

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where &#160;

the ultimate outcome is unknown, &#160;

such as 

economic developments affecting specific &#160;

customers, industries, or markets. &#160;

Other factors that can &#160;

affect management&#8217;s estimates 

are &#160;

recalibration &#160;

of &#160;

statistical &#160;

models &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

calculate &#160;

lifetime &#160;

expected &#160;

losses, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

financial 

accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, &#160;

among others. Changes in the financial condition &#160;

of individual borrowers, 

in economic &#160;

conditions, and &#160;

in the &#160;

condition of &#160;

the various &#160;

markets in &#160;

which collateral &#160;

may be &#160;

sold, may &#160;

also affect &#160;

the required 

level of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses. Consequently, &#160;

the business &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

capital, and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

could also be affected. 

On March 31, 2024, the ACL increased by $10 million from December &#160;

31, 2023, to $740 million. The ACL for BPPR increased by $4 

million, &#160;

primarily &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

higher &#160;

reserves &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

consumer &#160;

portfolios &#160;

attributable &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

credit &#160;

quality. &#160;

In &#160;

PB, &#160;

the &#160;

ACL 

increased by $6 million, when compared to December 31, 2023, mainly &#160;

driven by higher reserves for the commercial portfolio due to 

changes &#160;

in &#160;

credit &#160;

risk &#160;

ratings. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ratio &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

allowance for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses &#160;

to &#160;

loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio was &#160;

2.11% &#160;

on 

March 31, &#160;

2024, compared to &#160;

2.08% on December &#160;

31, 2023. &#160;

The ratio &#160;

of the &#160;

allowance for credit &#160;

losses to &#160;

NPLs held-in-portfolio 

stood at 208.8%, compared to 204.0% on December &#160;

31, 2023. 

Given that any one &#160;

economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the &#160;

Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate &#160;

its ACL. The 

baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, &#160;

followed by the pessimistic scenario. The weight assigned to the 

pessimistic &#160;

scenario &#160;

decreased &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2024 &#160;

in &#160;

response &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

positive &#160;

momentum &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

economy &#160;

as 

expectations for &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve achieving &#160;

a soft &#160;

landing have &#160;

improved. The &#160;

Corporation evaluates, &#160;

at least &#160;

on an &#160;

annual 

basis, the assumptions tied to the CECL accounting framework. These include &#160;

the reasonable and supportable period as well as the 

reversion window. 

The &#160;

2024 &#160;

annualized GDP &#160;

growth in &#160;

the &#160;

baseline scenario &#160;

improved to &#160;

2.0% &#160;

and &#160;

2.3% &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States, 

respectively, compared to 1.2% and 1.7% &#160;

in the previous quarter. The 2024 forecasted average unemployment rate for &#160;

Puerto Rico 

and the United States remained stable at 6.5% &#160;

and 3.9%, respectively, compared to 6.8% and 4.0% in previous forecast. 

The provision for credit losses for the period ended March 31, &#160;

2024, was $72.4 million, compared to an expense of $47.1 million &#160;

for 

the period &#160;

ended March 31, &#160;

2023, mostly related &#160;

to higher &#160;

NCOs due to &#160;

credit normalization. Refer &#160;

to Note &#160;

8 to &#160;

the Consolidated 

Financial Statements, and to the Provision for Credit &#160;
