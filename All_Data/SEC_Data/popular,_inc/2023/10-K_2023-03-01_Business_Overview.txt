Transformation Initiative: 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

launched &#160;

a &#160;

significant, &#160;

multi-year, &#160;

broad-based &#160;

technological &#160;

and &#160;

business &#160;

process &#160;

transformation &#160;

during &#160;

the 

second half of 2022. &#160;

The needs and expectations of our clients, as well &#160;

as the competitive landscape, have evolved, compelling us 

to make important investments in our technological infrastructure and adopt more agile practices. We &#160;

believe these investments will 

result in an enhanced digital experience for our clients, as &#160;

well as better technology and more efficient processes for our employees, 

and make us a more efficient and &#160;

profitable company, allowing us to &#160;

achieve a 14% return on tangible common equity target by &#160;

the 

end of 2025. &#160;

Our technology and business transformation &#160;

will be a significant &#160;

priority for the Corporation over &#160;

the next three years 

and beyond. Refer to the Overview section &#160;

of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis included in &#160;

&#160;

(1) Commercial. &#160;

Commercial loans are comprised of (i) commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loans and leases to commercial customers 

for &#160;

use &#160;

in &#160;

normal &#160;

business &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

finance &#160;

working &#160;

capital &#160;

needs, &#160;

equipment &#160;

purchases &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

projects, &#160;

and &#160;

(ii) 

commercial real &#160;

estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) loans &#160;

(excluding construction loans) &#160;

for income-producing real &#160;

estate properties as &#160;

well as &#160;

owner-

occupied properties. C&#38;I &#160;

loans are underwritten &#160;

individually and usually &#160;

secured with the &#160;

assets of the &#160;

company and the &#160;

personal 

guarantee &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

business &#160;

owners. CRE &#160;

loans consist &#160;

of &#160;

loans &#160;

for &#160;

income-producing real &#160;

estate &#160;

properties and &#160;

the financing &#160;

of 

owner-occupied facilities &#160;

if there &#160;

is real &#160;

estate as &#160;

collateral. Non-owner-occupied &#160;

CRE loans &#160;

are generally &#160;

made to &#160;

finance office 

and &#160;

industrial buildings, &#160;

healthcare facilities, &#160;

multifamily buildings &#160;

and &#160;

retail shopping &#160;

centers &#160;

and are &#160;

repaid through &#160;

cash &#160;

flows 

related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the &#160;

property. 

(2) Mortgage. Mortgage &#160;

loans include residential &#160;

mortgage loans to &#160;

consumers for the &#160;

purchase or refinancing &#160;

of a &#160;

residence and 

also include residential construction loans made &#160;

to individuals for the construction of refurbishment &#160;

of their residence. &#160;

(3) Consumer. &#160;

Consumer loans are mainly &#160;

comprised of personal loans, &#160;

credit cards, and automobile &#160;

loans, and to &#160;

a lesser extent 

home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) and other &#160;

loans made by banks to individual borrowers. &#160;

(4) &#160;

Construction. &#160;

Construction &#160;

loans &#160;

are &#160;

CRE &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

companies &#160;

or &#160;

developers &#160;

used &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

construction &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

commercial &#160;

or 

residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale &#160;

or permanent financing of the property. &#160;

Our construction loan 

portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and &#160;

condominiums), office and warehouse product types. &#160;

(5) Lease Financings. &#160;

Lease financings are offered by BPPR and are &#160;

primarily comprised of automobile loans/leases made through 

automotive dealerships and equipment lease financings. 

Business Concentration 

Since our &#160;

business activities &#160;

are currently concentrated &#160;

primarily in &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

our results &#160;

of operations &#160;

and financial 

condition are dependent upon the general trends of &#160;

the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, &#160;

the residential and commercial real 

estate markets. The concentration of our &#160;

operations in Puerto Rico exposes us &#160;

to greater risk than other &#160;

banking companies with a 

wider &#160;

geographic &#160;

base. &#160;

Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. &#160;

However, approximately 57% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 consisted 

of real estate-related &#160;

loans, including residential &#160;

mortgage loans, construction &#160;

loans and commercial &#160;

the primary &#160;

increase &#160;

the rates &#160;

cognizant that &#160;

our journey &#160;

employees&#8217; &#160;

emotional &#160;

well-being &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

Rules,&#8221; 

banking &#160;

organizations are &#160;

categorized based &#160;

on status &#160;

as &#160;

a U.S. &#160;

G-SIB, &#160;

size &#160;

and four &#160;

other risk-based &#160;

indicators. Among &#160;

bank 

holding companies with $100 &#160;

billion or more in &#160;

total consolidated assets, the &#160;

most stringent standards apply &#160;

to U.S. G-SIBs, &#160;

which 

are subject to Category I standards and the &#160;

least stringent standards apply to Category IV organizations, which have between $100 

billion and $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in all four &#160;

other risk-based indicators and which are also 

not U.S. G-SIBs. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to risk committee and risk 

management requirements. As of December 31, 2022, Popular &#160;

had total consolidated assets of $67.6 billion. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

BPPR and &#160;

PB are &#160;

subject to &#160;

restrictions that &#160;

limit the &#160;

amount of &#160;

extensions of &#160;

credit and &#160;

certain other &#160;

&#8220;covered transactions&#8221; &#160;

(as 

defined in Section &#160;

23A of the &#160;

Federal Reserve Act) &#160;

between BPPR or PB, &#160;

on the one &#160;

hand, and Popular, &#160;

PNA or any &#160;

of our other 

non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, &#160;

and that impose collateralization requirements on &#160;

such credit extensions. A bank &#160;

may 

not engage &#160;

in any &#160;

covered transaction if &#160;

the aggregate amount &#160;

of the bank&#8217;s &#160;

covered transactions with &#160;

that affiliate &#160;

would exceed 

10% of &#160;

the bank&#8217;s &#160;

capital stock &#160;

and surplus &#160;

or the &#160;

aggregate amount &#160;

of the &#160;

bank&#8217;s covered &#160;

transactions with &#160;

all affiliates &#160;

would 

exceed &#160;

20% &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

bank&#8217;s &#160;

capital &#160;

stock &#160;

and &#160;

surplus. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

any &#160;

transaction &#160;

between &#160;

BPPR &#160;

or &#160;

PB, &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

one &#160;

hand, &#160;

and 

Popular, PNA or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, on the &#160;

other, is required to be carried out on an arm&#8217;s length basis. 

Source of Financial Strength

The &#160;

Dodd-Frank Act &#160;

requires bank &#160;

holding companies, &#160;

such &#160;

as Popular &#160;

and &#160;

PNA, to &#160;

act &#160;

as &#160;

a source &#160;

of &#160;

financial &#160;

and 

managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Popular &#160;

and PNA are expected to commit resources &#160;

to support their subsidiary banks, 

including at times when Popular &#160;

and PNA may not be &#160;

in a financial position to &#160;

provide such resources. Any capital &#160;

loans by a bank 

holding company &#160;

to any &#160;

of its &#160;

subsidiary depository &#160;

institutions are &#160;

subordinated in &#160;

right of &#160;

payment to &#160;

depositors and &#160;

to certain 

other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the &#160;

event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, &#160;

any commitment 

by &#160;

the &#160;

bank &#160;

holding &#160;

company &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

federal &#160;

banking &#160;

agency &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

subsidiary &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

will &#160;

be 

assumed by &#160;

the bankruptcy &#160;

trustee and &#160;

entitled to &#160;

a priority &#160;

of payment. &#160;

BPPR and &#160;

PB are &#160;

currently the &#160;

only insured &#160;

depository 

institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. 

Resolution Planning 

A 

bank holding &#160;

company with &#160;

$250 billion &#160;

or more &#160;

in total &#160;

consolidated assets &#160;

(or that &#160;

is a &#160;

Category III &#160;

firm based &#160;

on 

certain risk-based indicators described in the Tailoring &#160;

Rules) is required to report periodically to the &#160;

FDIC and the Federal Reserve 

Board &#160;

such &#160;

company&#8217;s &#160;

plan &#160;

for &#160;

its &#160;

rapid &#160;

and &#160;

orderly &#160;

resolution &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

event &#160;

of &#160;

material &#160;

financial &#160;

distress &#160;

or &#160;

failure. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, 

insured depository institutions with total &#160;

assets of $50 billion or &#160;

more are required to &#160;

submit to the FDIC &#160;

periodic contingency plans 

for resolution &#160;

in the &#160;

event of &#160;

the institution&#8217;s &#160;

failure. In &#160;

June 2021, &#160;

the FDIC &#160;

issued a &#160;

Statement on &#160;

Resolution Plans &#160;

for Insured 

Depository Institutions, &#160;

which, among &#160;

other things, &#160;

establishes a three-year &#160;

filing cycle &#160;

for banks &#160;

with $100 &#160;

billion or &#160;

more in &#160;

total 

assets and provides details regarding the content &#160;

that filers will be expected to prepare. 

As of December 31, 2022, Popular, &#160;

PNA, BPPR and PB&#8217;s total assets were below &#160;

the thresholds for applicability of these 

rules. 

FDIC Insurance

Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of 

the &#160;

FDIC, &#160;

and &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

PB &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

FDIC &#160;

deposit &#160;

insurance &#160;

assessments &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

the &#160;

DIF. &#160;

Deposit &#160;

insurance 

assessments are &#160;

based on &#160;

the average &#160;

consolidated total &#160;

assets of &#160;

the insured &#160;

depository institution &#160;

minus the &#160;

average tangible 

equity of the institution during the assessment period. For larger &#160;

depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets, &#160;

such as BPPR 

and PB, the FDIC uses a &#8220;scorecard&#8221; methodology, which considers CAMELS ratings, among other &#160;

measures, that seeks to capture 

both the probability that an individual large institution will &#160;

fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF &#160;

if such a failure occurs. The 

FDIC has the ability &#160;

to make discretionary adjustments to the &#160;

total score based upon significant &#160;

risk factors that are not &#160;

adequately 

captured in the calculations. The initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for larger depository institutions ranges from 3 to 30 

basis points on an annualized basis. &#160;

After the effect of &#160;

potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could &#160;

range 

from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized &#160;

basis. 

On October 18, &#160;

2022, the FDIC finalized &#160;

a rule that &#160;

would increase initial &#160;

base deposit insurance assessment &#160;

rates by 2 

basis &#160;

points, &#160;

beginning &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarterly &#160;

assessment &#160;

period &#160;

of &#160;

2023. &#160;

The &#160;

FDIC, &#160;

as &#160;

required &#160;

under &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Deposit 

Insurance &#160;

Act &#160;

(&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), &#160;

established &#160;

a &#160;

plan &#160;

in &#160;

September &#160;

2020 &#160;

to &#160;

restore &#160;

the &#160;

DIF &#160;

reserve &#160;

ratio &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

or &#160;

exceed &#160;

the &#160;

statutory 

minimum of &#160;

1.35 percent &#160;

within eight &#160;

years. The &#160;

increased assessment &#160;

is intended &#160;

to improve &#160;

the likelihood &#160;

that the &#160;

DIF reserve 

ratio would reach the required minimum by the &#160;

statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. 

As &#160;

of &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

we &#160;

had &#160;

a &#160;

DIF &#160;

average &#160;

total &#160;

asset &#160;

less &#160;

average &#160;

tangible &#160;

equity &#160;

assessment &#160;

base &#160;

of 

approximately $65 billion. 

Brokered Deposits

The FDIA &#160;

and regulations &#160;

adopted thereunder &#160;

restrict the &#160;

use of &#160;

brokered deposits &#160;

and the &#160;

rate of &#160;

interest payable &#160;

on 

deposits for &#160;

institutions that &#160;

are &#160;

less than &#160;

well capitalized. &#160;

There are &#160;

no such &#160;

restrictions on &#160;

a bank &#160;

that &#160;

is well &#160;

capitalized (see 

&#8220;Prompt &#160;

Corrective &#160;

Action&#8221; &#160;

below &#160;

for &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

standard &#160;

of &#160;

&#8220;well &#160;

capitalized&#8221;). &#160;

Popular &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

believe &#160;

the &#160;

brokered 

deposits regulations have had or will have a &#160;

material effect on the funding or liquidity of BPPR and PB. 

Capital Adequacy

Popular, Popular, &#160;

BPPR and PB &#160;

are each required &#160;

to comply &#160;

with applicable capital &#160;

adequacy standards established &#160;

by 

the &#160;

federal &#160;

banking &#160;

agencies &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;Capital &#160;

Rules&#8221;), &#160;

which &#160;

implement &#160;

the &#160;

Basel &#160;

III &#160;

framework &#160;

set &#160;

forth &#160;

by &#160;

Basel &#160;

Committee &#160;

on 

Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) as &#160;

well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank &#160;

Act. 

Among other &#160;

matters, the &#160;

Capital Rules: &#160;

(i) impose &#160;

a capital &#160;

measure called &#160;

&#8220;Common Equity &#160;

Tier &#160;

1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) &#160;

and the 

related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 

capital&#8221; instruments meeting &#160;

certain revised requirements; &#160;

and (iii) mandate &#160;

that most deductions/adjustments to &#160;

regulatory capital 

measures be made &#160;

to CET1 &#160;

and not to &#160;

the other components &#160;

of capital. &#160;

Under the Capital &#160;

Rules, for most &#160;

banking organizations, 

including &#160;

Popular, &#160;

the &#160;

most &#160;

common &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

Additional &#160;

Tier &#160;

1 &#160;

capital &#160;

is &#160;

non-cumulative &#160;

perpetual preferred &#160;

stock &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

most 

common form of Tier &#160;

2 capital is subordinated notes and &#160;

a portion of the &#160;

allocation for loan and lease losses, &#160;

in each case, subject 

to the Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum &#160;

capital ratios are: 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted &#160;

assets; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported &#160;

on consolidated financial statements (known &#160;

as the 

&#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

The Capital Rules also impose &#160;

a &#8220;capital conservation buffer,&#8221; &#160;

composed entirely of CET1, on top &#160;

of these minimum risk-

weighted &#160;

asset &#160;

ratios. The &#160;

capital &#160;

conservation &#160;

buffer &#160;

is &#160;

designed &#160;

to &#160;

absorb &#160;

losses &#160;

during &#160;

periods &#160;

of &#160;

economic stress. &#160;

Banking 

institutions &#160;

with &#160;

a &#160;

ratio &#160;

of &#160;

CET1 &#160;

to &#160;

risk-weighted &#160;

assets &#160;

above &#160;

the &#160;

minimum &#160;

but &#160;

below &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

conservation &#160;

buffer &#160;

will &#160;

face 

constraints on &#160;

dividends, equity repurchases &#160;

and compensation based &#160;

on the &#160;

amount of &#160;

the shortfall and &#160;

eligible retained &#160;

income 

(that is, &#160;

four quarter trailing &#160;

net income, net &#160;

of distributions &#160;

and tax &#160;

effects not &#160;

reflected in net &#160;

income). Thus, Popular, &#160;

BPPR and 

PB are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of &#160;

(i) 

CET1 to risk-weighted assets &#160;

of at least 7%, &#160;

(ii) Tier 1 &#160;

capital to risk-weighted assets of &#160;

at least 8.5%, and &#160;

(iii) Total &#160;

capital to risk-

weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

In addition, under &#160;

prior risk-based capital rules, &#160;

the effects of &#160;

accumulated other comprehensive income &#160;

or loss (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) 

items included in stockholders&#8217; &#160;

equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities &#160;

held in the available &#160;

for sale portfolio) under &#160;

U.S. 

GAAP were reversed &#160;

for the &#160;

purposes of determining &#160;

regulatory capital ratios. &#160;

Pursuant to the &#160;

Capital Rules, the &#160;

effects of certain 

AOCI items &#160;

are not &#160;

excluded; however, &#160;

non-advanced approaches &#160;

banking organizations, &#160;

including Popular, &#160;

BPPR and &#160;

PB, may 

make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Popular, &#160;

BPPR and PB have made this election in order to 

avoid significant &#160;

variations in &#160;

the level &#160;

of capital &#160;

depending upon &#160;

the impact &#160;

of interest &#160;

rate fluctuations &#160;

on the &#160;

fair value &#160;

of their 

securities portfolios. &#160;

The &#160;

Capital &#160;

Rules &#160;

preclude certain &#160;

hybrid &#160;

securities, such &#160;

as &#160;

trust &#160;

preferred &#160;

securities, from &#160;

inclusion &#160;

in &#160;

bank &#160;

holding 

companies&#8217; Tier 1 capital. Trust preferred securities no &#160;

longer included in Popular&#8217;s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a 

component of &#160;

Tier 2 capital. &#160;

Popular has &#160;

not issued &#160;

any trust &#160;

preferred securities since &#160;

May 19, &#160;

2010. As &#160;

of December &#160;

31, 2022, 

Popular has &#160;

$193 million &#160;

of trust &#160;

preferred securities &#160;

outstanding which &#160;

no longer &#160;

qualify for &#160;

Tier &#160;

1 capital &#160;

treatment, but &#160;

instead 

qualify for Tier 2 capital treatment.

The Capital &#160;

Rules also &#160;

provide for &#160;

a number &#160;

of deductions &#160;

from and &#160;

adjustments to &#160;

CET1. &#160;

Non-advanced approaches 

banking organizations &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

rules that &#160;

provide for &#160;

simplified capital &#160;

requirements relating &#160;

to the &#160;

threshold deductions &#160;

for 

certain &#160;

mortgage &#160;

servicing &#160;

assets, &#160;

deferred &#160;

tax &#160;

assets, &#160;

investments &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

of &#160;

unconsolidated &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions &#160;

and 

inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital. 

Failure &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

capital &#160;

guidelines &#160;

could &#160;

subject &#160;

Popular &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

variety &#160;

of 

enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC &#160;

and to certain restrictions on our business. Refer 

to &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action&#8221; below for further &#160;

discussion. 

In &#160;

December 2017, &#160;

the Basel &#160;

Committee published &#160;

standards that &#160;

it &#160;

described as &#160;

the finalization &#160;

of the &#160;

Basel III &#160;

post-

crisis regulatory &#160;

reforms. Among other &#160;

things, these &#160;

standards revise &#160;

the Basel &#160;

Committee&#8217;s standardized approach &#160;

for credit &#160;

risk 

(including &#160;

by &#160;

recalibrating &#160;

risk &#160;

weights &#160;

and &#160;

introducing &#160;

new &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements &#160;

for &#160;

certain &#160;

&#8220;unconditionally &#160;

cancellable 

commitments,&#8221; such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. The 

Basel framework &#160;

contemplates that &#160;

these standards &#160;

will generally be &#160;

effective on &#160;

January 1, &#160;

2023, with &#160;

an aggregate &#160;

output floor 

phasing in through January 1, 2028. The federal &#160;

bank regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards. Under 

the &#160;

current &#160;

U.S. &#160;

capital &#160;

rules, &#160;

operational &#160;

risk &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements &#160;

and &#160;

a &#160;

capital &#160;

floor &#160;

apply &#160;

only &#160;

to &#160;

advanced &#160;

approaches 

institutions, and &#160;

not to Popular, &#160;

BPPR and &#160;

PB. The impact &#160;

of these standards &#160;

on us &#160;

will depend on &#160;

the manner &#160;

in which they &#160;

are 

implemented by the federal bank regulators. 

In &#160;

December &#160;

2018, &#160;

the &#160;

federal &#160;

banking &#160;

agencies &#160;

approved &#160;

a &#160;

final &#160;

rule &#160;

modifying &#160;

their &#160;

regulatory &#160;

capital &#160;

rules &#160;

and 

providing an &#160;

option to &#160;

phase in &#160;

over a &#160;

period of &#160;

three years &#160;

the day-one &#160;

regulatory capital &#160;

effects of &#160;

the Current &#160;

Expected Credit 

Loss (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) model &#160;

of ASU 2016-13. &#160;

The final &#160;

rule also revised &#160;

the agencies&#8217; &#160;

other rules to &#160;

reflect the update &#160;

to the &#160;

accounting 

standards. Popular has availed itself &#160;

of the option to &#160;

phase in over a period &#160;

of three years the &#160;

day one effects on &#160;

regulatory capital 

from the &#160;

adoption of &#160;

CECL. In &#160;

2020, federal &#160;

bank regulators &#160;

adopted a &#160;

rule that &#160;

allowed banking &#160;

organizations to &#160;

elect to &#160;

delay 

temporarily &#160;

the &#160;

estimated &#160;

effects &#160;

of &#160;

adopting &#160;

CECL &#160;

on &#160;

regulatory &#160;

capital &#160;

until &#160;

January &#160;

2022 &#160;

and &#160;

subsequently &#160;

to &#160;

phase &#160;

in &#160;

the 

effects through January 2025. Under the rule, during 2020 and &#160;

2021, the adjustment to CET1 capital reflects the change in retained 

earnings upon &#160;

adoption of CECL &#160;

at January &#160;

1, 2020, plus &#160;

25% of the &#160;

increase in &#160;

the allowance for &#160;

credit losses since &#160;

January 1, 

2020.

Prompt Corrective Action

The &#160;

FDIA &#160;

requires, &#160;

among &#160;

other &#160;

things, &#160;

the &#160;

federal &#160;

banking &#160;

agencies &#160;

to &#160;

take &#160;

prompt &#160;

corrective &#160;

action &#160;

in &#160;

respect &#160;

of 

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institutions &#160;

that &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

meet &#160;

minimum &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements. &#160;

The &#160;

FDIA &#160;

establishes &#160;

five &#160;

capital &#160;

tiers: &#160;

&#8220;well 

capitalized,&#8221; &#160;

&#8220;adequately &#160;

capitalized,&#8221; &#160;

&#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#160;

&#8220;significantly &#160;

undercapitalized,&#8221; &#160;

and &#160;

&#8220;critically &#160;

undercapitalized&#8221;. &#160;

A 

depository institution&#8217;s capital tier will depend upon how its &#160;

capital levels compare with various relevant capital &#160;

measures and certain 

other factors. 

An insured &#160;

depository institution will &#160;

be deemed &#160;

to be &#160;

(i) &#8220;well &#160;

capitalized&#8221; if &#160;

the institution &#160;

has a &#160;

total risk-based &#160;

capital 

ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% &#160;

or greater, a Tier 1 &#160;

risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage 

ratio of 5.0% or &#160;

greater, and is &#160;

not subject to any order &#160;

or written directive by &#160;

any such regulatory authority to &#160;

meet and maintain a 

specific capital level for any capital &#160;

measure; (ii) &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if the institution &#160;

has a total risk-based capital ratio &#160;

of 8.0% 

or greater, a &#160;

CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% &#160;

or greater, a &#160;

Tier 1 risk-based capital &#160;

ratio of 6.0% or greater, &#160;

and a leverage ratio of &#160;

4.0% 

or greater &#160;

and is &#160;

not &#8220;well &#160;

capitalized&#8221;; (iii) &#160;

&#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if &#160;

the institution &#160;

has a &#160;

total risk-based &#160;

capital ratio &#160;

that is &#160;

less than 

8.0%, a CET1 capital &#160;

ratio less than 4.5%, &#160;

a Tier 1 &#160;

risk-based capital ratio of &#160;

less than 6.0% or &#160;

a leverage ratio of &#160;

less than 4.0%; 

(iv) &#8220;significantly &#160;

undercapitalized&#8221; if &#160;

the institution &#160;

has a &#160;

total risk-based &#160;

capital ratio &#160;

of less &#160;

than 6.0%, &#160;

a CET1 &#160;

capital ratio &#160;

less 

than 3%, a Tier &#160;

1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or &#160;

a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; &#160;

and (v) &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; 

if &#160;

the &#160;

institution&#8217;s &#160;

tangible &#160;

equity &#160;

is &#160;

equal &#160;

to &#160;

or &#160;

less &#160;

than &#160;

2.0% &#160;

of &#160;

average &#160;

quarterly &#160;

tangible &#160;

assets. &#160;

An &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

be 

downgraded to, or deemed &#160;

to be in, a &#160;

capital category that is &#160;

lower than indicated by &#160;

its capital ratios if &#160;

it is determined to &#160;

be in an 

unsafe &#160;

or &#160;

unsound &#160;

condition &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

it &#160;

receives &#160;

an &#160;

unsatisfactory &#160;

examination &#160;

rating &#160;

with &#160;

respect &#160;

to &#160;

certain &#160;

matters. &#160;

An &#160;

insured 

depository institution&#8217;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action &#160;

regulations, and the 

capital category &#160;

may not &#160;

constitute an &#160;

accurate representation &#160;

of the &#160;

institution&#8217;s overall &#160;

financial condition &#160;

or prospects &#160;

for other 

purposes. 

The FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of &#160;

a 

dividend) or &#160;

paying any &#160;

management fee to &#160;

its holding &#160;

company, if &#160;

the depository &#160;

institution would thereafter &#160;

be undercapitalized. 

Undercapitalized &#160;

depository &#160;

institutions &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

restrictions &#160;

on &#160;

borrowing &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

System. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, 

undercapitalized &#160;

depository &#160;

institutions &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

growth &#160;

limitations &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

submit &#160;

capital &#160;

restoration &#160;

plans. &#160;

A 

depository institution&#8217;s &#160;

holding company must &#160;

guarantee the capital &#160;

restoration plan, up &#160;

to an &#160;

amount equal to &#160;

the lesser &#160;

of 5% of 

the &#160;

depository &#160;

institution&#8217;s &#160;

assets &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

it &#160;

becomes &#160;

undercapitalized &#160;

or &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

deficiency, &#160;

when &#160;

the 

institution fails to comply with the &#160;

plan. The federal banking agencies may &#160;

not accept a capital restoration plan without &#160;

determining, 

among other things, &#160;

that the plan &#160;

is based &#160;

on realistic assumptions &#160;

and is &#160;

likely to succeed &#160;

in restoring the &#160;

depository institution&#8217;s 

capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an &#160;

acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#160;

significantly undercapitalized. 

Significantly &#160;

undercapitalized &#160;

depository &#160;

institutions &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

number &#160;

of &#160;

requirements &#160;

and &#160;

restrictions, 

including orders to &#160;

sell sufficient voting &#160;

stock to become &#160;

adequately capitalized, requirements to &#160;

reduce total assets &#160;

and cessation 

of receipt &#160;

of deposits &#160;

from correspondent &#160;

banks. Critically &#160;

undercapitalized depository &#160;

institutions are &#160;

subject to &#160;

appointment of &#160;

a 

receiver or conservator. 

The capital-based prompt &#160;

corrective action provisions &#160;

of the FDIA &#160;

apply to &#160;

the FDIC-insured depository &#160;

institutions such 

as &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

PB, &#160;

but &#160;

they &#160;

are &#160;

not &#160;

directly &#160;

applicable &#160;

to &#160;

holding &#160;

companies &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

Popular &#160;

and &#160;

PNA, &#160;

which &#160;

control &#160;

such 

institutions. As of December 31, 2022, &#160;

both BPPR and PB were well capitalized. 

Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

Popular &#160;

and &#160;

PNA &#160;

have &#160;

included &#160;

dividends &#160;

received &#160;

from &#160;

their &#160;

banking &#160;

and &#160;

non-

banking subsidiaries, asset sales &#160;

and proceeds from &#160;

the issuance of &#160;

debt and equity. &#160;

Various statutory &#160;

provisions limit the amount 

of &#160;

dividends an &#160;

insured depository &#160;

institution may &#160;

pay to &#160;

its &#160;

holding company &#160;

without regulatory &#160;

approval. A &#160;

member bank &#160;

must 

obtain the approval of the &#160;

Federal Reserve Board for any &#160;

dividend, if the total of &#160;

all dividends declared by the &#160;

member bank during 

the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, &#160;

combined with its retained net income for the preceding two 

years, after &#160;

considering those &#160;

years&#8217; dividend &#160;

activity, &#160;

less any &#160;

required transfers to &#160;

surplus or &#160;

to a &#160;

fund for &#160;

the retirement &#160;

of any 

preferred stock. During the year &#160;

ended December 31, 2022, BPPR declared &#160;

cash dividends of $450 million, &#160;

a portion of which was 

used by &#160;

Popular for &#160;

the payments &#160;

of the &#160;

cash dividends &#160;

on its &#160;

outstanding common &#160;

stock and &#160;

$231 million &#160;

in accelerated &#160;

stock 

repurchases. &#160;

At &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

needed &#160;

to &#160;

obtain &#160;

prior &#160;

approval &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board &#160;

before &#160;

declaring &#160;

a 

dividend in excess of $53 million due to its declared &#160;

dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the three year&#8217;s ended 

December 31, 2022. In &#160;

addition, a member bank &#160;

may not declare &#160;

or pay a &#160;

dividend in an &#160;

amount greater than its &#160;

undivided profits 

as &#160;

reported &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

Report of &#160;

Condition and &#160;

Income, &#160;

unless the &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

has &#160;

received the &#160;

approval &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve 

Board. A &#160;

member bank &#160;

also may &#160;

not permit &#160;

any portion &#160;

of its &#160;

permanent capital to &#160;

be withdrawn &#160;

unless the &#160;

withdrawal has &#160;

been 

approved by &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. Pursuant &#160;

to these &#160;

requirements, PB may &#160;

not declare &#160;

or pay &#160;

a dividend &#160;

without the &#160;

prior 

approval of the Federal Reserve Board and &#160;

the NYSDFS. 

It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common &#160;

stock only out 

of net &#160;

income available to &#160;

common shareholders &#160;

over the past &#160;

year and &#160;

only if &#160;

the prospective rate &#160;

of earnings retention &#160;

appears 

consistent with the organization&#8217;s current and &#160;

expected future capital needs, asset quality &#160;

and overall financial condition. Moreover, 

under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank &#160;

holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the 

capital of depository &#160;

institution subsidiaries or that &#160;

may undermine the bank &#160;

holding company&#8217;s ability to &#160;

be a source &#160;

of strength to 

its &#160;

banking subsidiaries. &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

policy &#160;

also &#160;

provides that &#160;

a &#160;

bank &#160;

holding company &#160;

should &#160;

inform &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve 

reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that &#160;

exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is &#160;

being paid or 

that could result in a material adverse change &#160;

to the bank holding company&#8217;s capital structure. &#160;

The &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Board &#160;

also restricts &#160;

the &#160;

ability of &#160;

banking &#160;

organizations to &#160;

conduct stock &#160;

repurchases. In &#160;

certain 

circumstances, a banking organization&#8217;s repurchases &#160;

of its common stock may &#160;

be subject to a &#160;

prior approval or notice &#160;

requirement 

under other regulations or policies of the Federal Reserve. Any redemption or &#160;

repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt is 

subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 

Subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation &#160;

organized under the 

laws &#160;

of the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

a withholding &#160;

tax &#160;

of 10% &#160;

instead of &#160;

the 30% &#160;

applied to &#160;

other &#8220;foreign&#8221; 

corporations. Accordingly, dividends from current or accumulated earnings and profits paid &#160;

by PNA to Popular, Inc. sourced from the 

U.S. operations of PB are subject to a 10% &#160;

tax withholding.

Interstate Branching

The Dodd-Frank &#160;

Act amended &#160;

the Riegle-Neal &#160;

Interstate Banking &#160;

and Branching &#160;

Efficiency Act &#160;

of 1994 &#160;

(the &#8220;Interstate 

Banking &#160;

Act&#8221;) &#160;

to &#160;

authorize &#160;

national &#160;

banks &#160;

and &#160;

state &#160;

banks &#160;

to &#160;

branch &#160;

interstate &#160;

through 

de &#160;

novo

&#160;

branches. For &#160;

purposes &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Interstate Banking Act, BPPR is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state 

banks. 

Activities and Acquisitions

In general, the BHC Act limits the activities &#160;

permissible for bank holding companies to the business of banking, managing 

or controlling banks and such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to 

be &#160;

properly &#160;

incidental &#160;

thereto. &#160;

A &#160;

company &#160;

who &#160;

meets &#160;

management &#160;

and &#160;

capital &#160;

standards &#160;

and &#160;

whose &#160;

subsidiary &#160;

depository 

institutions meet management, &#160;

capital and &#160;

Community Reinvestment Act &#160;

(&#8220;CRA&#8221;) standards may &#160;

elect to &#160;

be treated &#160;

as a &#160;

financial 

holding company &#160;

and engage &#160;

in a &#160;

substantially broader &#160;

range of &#160;

nonbanking financial &#160;

activities, including &#160;

securities underwriting 

and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant &#160;

banking investments in nonfinancial companies. 

In order for a bank holding company to elect to be treated as a financial &#160;

holding company, (i) all of its depository institution 

subsidiaries &#160;

must &#160;

be &#160;

well capitalized &#160;

(as described &#160;

above) &#160;

and &#160;

well managed &#160;

and &#160;

(ii) &#160;

it &#160;

must &#160;

file a &#160;

declaration with &#160;

the Federal 

Reserve Board that it elects to be a &#8220;financial holding &#160;

company.&#8221; As noted above, a bank &#160;

holding company electing to be a financial 

holding company must itself be and remain &#160;

well capitalized and well managed. The Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s &#160;

regulations applicable 

to bank holding companies separately define &#160;

&#8220;well capitalized&#8221; for bank holding companies, &#160;

such as Popular, &#160;

to require maintaining 

a tier 1 capital &#160;

ratio of at least &#160;

6% and a total capital &#160;

ratio of at least 10%. &#160;

Popular and PNA have elected &#160;

to be treated as &#160;

financial 

holding &#160;

companies. &#160;

A &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

is &#160;

deemed &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

&#8220;well &#160;

managed&#8221; &#160;

if, &#160;

at &#160;

its &#160;

most &#160;

recent &#160;

inspection, &#160;

examination &#160;

or 

subsequent review &#160;

by the &#160;

appropriate federal banking &#160;

agency (or &#160;

the appropriate state &#160;

banking agency), the &#160;

depository institution 

received &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

a &#160;

&#8220;satisfactory&#8221; &#160;

composite &#160;

rating &#160;

and &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

a &#160;

&#8220;satisfactory&#8221; &#160;

rating &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

management &#160;

component &#160;

of &#160;

the 

composite &#160;

rating. &#160;

If, &#160;

after &#160;

becoming &#160;

a &#160;

financial &#160;

holding &#160;

company, &#160;

the &#160;

company &#160;

fails &#160;

to &#160;

continue &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

any &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

or 

management requirements &#160;

for financial &#160;

holding company &#160;

status, the &#160;

company &#160;

must &#160;

enter into &#160;

a confidential &#160;

agreement with &#160;

the 

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board &#160;

to &#160;

comply &#160;

with &#160;

all &#160;

applicable capital &#160;

and &#160;

management &#160;

requirements. &#160;

If &#160;

the &#160;

company &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

return &#160;

to 

compliance &#160;

within &#160;

180 &#160;

days, &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board &#160;

may &#160;

extend &#160;

the &#160;

agreement &#160;

or &#160;

may &#160;

order &#160;

the &#160;

company &#160;

to &#160;

divest &#160;

its 

subsidiary banks or the &#160;

company may discontinue, or &#160;

divest investments in companies &#160;

engaged in, activities permissible only &#160;

for a 

bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial &#160;

holding company. In addition, if a depository institution subsidiary 

controlled by a financial holding company does not &#160;

maintain a CRA rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; the financial holding company &#160;

will 

be subject to restrictions on certain new activities &#160;

and acquisitions. 

The Federal Reserve Board &#160;

may in certain circumstances limit &#160;

our ability to conduct &#160;

activities and make acquisitions that 

would otherwise be permissible for &#160;

a financial holding company. &#160;

Furthermore, a financial holding company must obtain &#160;

prior written 

approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring a nonbank company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. 

In addition, we &#160;

are required to &#160;

obtain prior Federal &#160;

Reserve Board approval &#160;

before engaging in &#160;

certain banking and &#160;

other financial 

activities both in the United States and abroad. 

The &#8220;Volcker &#160;

Rule&#8221; adopted &#160;

as part &#160;

of the &#160;

Dodd-Frank Act &#160;

restricts the &#160;

ability of &#160;

Popular and &#160;

its subsidiaries, &#160;

including 

BPPR and PB as &#160;

well as non-banking subsidiaries, to &#160;

sponsor or invest in &#160;

&#8220;covered funds,&#8221; including private funds, &#160;

or to engage in 

certain types &#160;

of proprietary &#160;

trading. Popular &#160;

and its &#160;

subsidiaries generally &#160;

do not &#160;

engage in &#160;

the businesses &#160;

subject to &#160;

the Volcker 

Rule; therefore, the Volcker Rule does not have a material effect on our &#160;

operations. &#160;

Anti-Money Laundering Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act

A major focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in &#160;

recent years has been aimed at combating money 

laundering and &#160;

terrorist financing. &#160;

The USA &#160;

PATRIOT &#160;

Act of &#160;

2001 (the &#160;

&#8220;USA PATRIOT &#160;

Act&#8221;) strengthened &#160;

the ability &#160;

of the &#160;

U.S. 

government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money &#160;

laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title &#160;

III of the USA 

PATRIOT &#160;

Act imposed &#160;

significant compliance &#160;

and due &#160;

diligence obligations, &#160;

created new &#160;

crimes and &#160;

penalties and &#160;

expanded the 

extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#8217;s requirements 

could have serious legal and reputational consequences &#160;

for the institution. 

The &#160;

Anti-Money &#160;

Laundering &#160;

Act &#160;

of &#160;

2020 &#160;

(&#8220;AMLA&#8221;), &#160;

which &#160;

amended &#160;

the &#160;

Bank &#160;

Secrecy &#160;

Act &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;BSA&#8221;), &#160;

is &#160;

intended &#160;

to 

comprehensively &#160;

reform &#160;

and &#160;

modernize &#160;

U.S. &#160;

anti-money &#160;

laundering &#160;

laws. &#160;

Among &#160;

other &#160;

things, &#160;

the &#160;

AMLA &#160;

codifies &#160;

a &#160;

risk-based 

approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to &#160;

promulgate 

priorities &#160;

for &#160;

anti-money &#160;

laundering &#160;

and &#160;

countering &#160;

the &#160;

financing &#160;

of &#160;

terrorism &#160;

policy; &#160;

requires &#160;

the &#160;

development &#160;

of &#160;

standards &#160;

for 

testing technology and &#160;

internal processes for BSA &#160;

compliance; expands enforcement- &#160;

and investigation-related authority, &#160;

including 

a &#160;

significant &#160;

expansion &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

available &#160;

sanctions &#160;

for &#160;

certain &#160;

BSA &#160;

violations; &#160;

and &#160;

expands &#160;

BSA &#160;

whistleblower &#160;

incentives &#160;

and 

protections. Many of &#160;

the statutory provisions &#160;

in the AMLA &#160;

will require additional &#160;

rulemakings, reports and &#160;

other measures, and &#160;

the 

impact &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

AMLA &#160;

will &#160;

depend on, &#160;

among &#160;

other &#160;

things, &#160;

rulemaking and &#160;

implementation guidance. &#160;

In &#160;

June &#160;

2021, &#160;

the &#160;

Financial 

Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of &#160;

the U.S. Department of the &#160;

Treasury, &#160;

issued the priorities for anti-money laundering &#160;

and 

countering the &#160;

financing of &#160;

terrorism policy &#160;

required under AMLA. &#160;

The priorities &#160;

include: corruption, cybercrime, &#160;

terrorist financing, 

fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and &#160;

proliferation financing. 

Federal regulators &#160;

regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money &#160;

Laundering and sanctions &#160;

compliance to &#160;

enhance their &#160;

adequacy 

and effectiveness, and the frequency and extent of such examinations &#160;

and related remedial actions have been &#160;

increasing. 

Community Reinvestment Act

The &#160;

CRA &#160;

requires &#160;

banks &#160;

to &#160;

help &#160;

serve &#160;

the &#160;

credit &#160;

needs &#160;

of &#160;

their &#160;

communities, &#160;

including &#160;

extending &#160;

credit &#160;

to &#160;

low- &#160;

and 

moderate-income individuals &#160;

and geographies. &#160;

Should &#160;

Popular &#160;

or our &#160;

bank &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

fail &#160;

to &#160;

serve &#160;

adequately &#160;

the community, 

potential penalties may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate offices or branches, add subsidiaries 

and affiliates, expand into &#160;

new financial activities and merge &#160;

with or purchase other financial &#160;

institutions. In May 2022, the &#160;

Office of 

the Comptroller &#160;

of the &#160;

Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board, &#160;

and the &#160;

FDIC jointly &#160;

issued a &#160;

proposed rule &#160;

to &#160;

modernize 

federal banking &#160;

agencies&#8217; CRA &#160;

regulations. The &#160;

proposed rule &#160;

would adjust &#160;

CRA evaluations &#160;

based on &#160;

bank size &#160;

and type, &#160;

with 

many of the proposed changes applying only to banks &#160;

with over $2 billion in assets and several applying &#160;

only to banks with over $10 

billion in assets, &#160;

such as Popular. &#160;

The effects on &#160;

Popular of any &#160;

potential change to the &#160;

CRA rules will &#160;

depend on the final &#160;

form of 

any Federal Reserve rulemaking. 

Interchange Fees Regulation

The Federal Reserve Board &#160;

has established standards for &#160;

debit card interchange fees &#160;

and prohibited network exclusivity 

arrangements and routing restrictions. The &#160;

maximum permissible interchange fee that &#160;

an issuer may receive &#160;

for an electronic debit 

transaction is &#160;

the sum &#160;

of &#160;

21 cents &#160;

per transaction &#160;

and 5 &#160;

basis points &#160;

multiplied by &#160;

the value &#160;

of &#160;

the transaction. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the 

Federal Reserve &#160;

Board allows &#160;

for an &#160;

upward adjustment &#160;

of &#160;

no more &#160;

than 1 &#160;

cent &#160;

to &#160;

an issuer&#8217;s &#160;

debit card &#160;

interchange fee &#160;

if the 

issuer develops and implements policies and procedures &#160;

reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention &#160;

standards.

Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010

The Consumer &#160;

Financial Protection &#160;

Bureau (the &#160;

&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) supervises &#160;

&#8220;covered persons&#8221; &#160;

(broadly defined &#160;

to include &#160;

any 

person offering or &#160;

providing a consumer financial &#160;

product or service and &#160;

any affiliated service &#160;

provider) for compliance with &#160;

federal 

consumer financial laws. The CFPB &#160;

also has the broad power &#160;

to prescribe rules applicable to &#160;

a covered person or service &#160;

provider 

identifying &#160;

as &#160;

unlawful, &#160;

unfair, &#160;

deceptive, &#160;

or &#160;

abusive &#160;

acts &#160;

or &#160;

practices &#160;

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

any &#160;

transaction &#160;

with &#160;

a &#160;

consumer &#160;

for &#160;

a 

consumer financial product or service, or the offering of &#160;

a consumer financial product or service. We are subject to examination and 

regulation by the CFPB. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation

The &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

Department &#160;

Office &#160;

of &#160;

Foreign &#160;

Assets &#160;

Control &#160;

(&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) &#160;

administers &#160;

economic &#160;

sanctions &#160;

that &#160;

affect 

transactions &#160;

with &#160;

designated &#160;

foreign &#160;

countries, &#160;

nationals &#160;

and &#160;

others. &#160;

The &#160;

OFAC-administered &#160;

sanctions &#160;

targeting &#160;

countries &#160;

take 

many &#160;

different &#160;

forms. &#160;

Generally, &#160;

however, &#160;

they &#160;

contain &#160;

one &#160;

or &#160;

more &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

following &#160;

elements: &#160;

(i) &#160;

restrictions &#160;

on &#160;

trade &#160;

with &#160;

or 

investment in a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking &#160;

of assets in which the government of the &#160;

sanctioned country or other specially 

designated nationals have an interest, by prohibiting &#160;

transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including &#160;

property in the United 

States or the possession or control of U.S. &#160;

persons outside of the United States). Blocked assets (e.g., property &#160;

and bank deposits) 

cannot &#160;

be &#160;

paid &#160;

out, &#160;

withdrawn, set &#160;

off &#160;

or &#160;

transferred &#160;

in &#160;

any &#160;

manner without &#160;

a &#160;

license &#160;

from &#160;

OFAC. &#160;

Failure &#160;

to &#160;

comply &#160;

with these 

sanctions could have serious legal and reputational &#160;

consequences. 

Protection of Customer Personal Information and &#160;

Cybersecurity 

The privacy &#160;

provisions of &#160;

the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act &#160;

of 1999 &#160;

generally prohibit financial &#160;

institutions, including &#160;

us, from 

disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to &#160;

third parties for certain purposes (primarily marketing) 

unless &#160;

customers &#160;

have &#160;

the &#160;

opportunity &#160;

to &#160;

opt &#160;

out &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

disclosure. &#160;

The &#160;

Fair &#160;

Credit &#160;

Reporting &#160;

Act &#160;

restricts &#160;

information &#160;

sharing 

among affiliates for marketing purposes and governs &#160;

the use and provision of information to consumer &#160;

reporting agencies. 

The federal &#160;

banking regulators have &#160;

also issued guidance &#160;

and proposed rules &#160;

regarding cybersecurity that &#160;

are intended 

to &#160;

enhance cyber &#160;

risk management &#160;

standards among &#160;

financial institutions. &#160;

A &#160;

financial institution &#160;

is expected &#160;

to &#160;

establish lines &#160;

of 

defense &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

processes &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

designed &#160;

to &#160;

address &#160;

the &#160;

risk &#160;

posed &#160;

by &#160;

compromised &#160;

customer 

credentials. A &#160;

financial institution&#8217;s &#160;

management is &#160;

expected to &#160;

maintain sufficient &#160;

business continuity &#160;

planning processes &#160;

for the 

rapid &#160;

recovery, &#160;

resumption &#160;

and &#160;

maintenance &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

institution&#8217;s &#160;

operations &#160;

after &#160;

a &#160;

cyber-attack &#160;

involving &#160;

destructive &#160;

malware. &#160;

A 

financial &#160;

institution &#160;

is &#160;

also &#160;

expected &#160;

to &#160;

develop &#160;

appropriate &#160;

processes &#160;

to &#160;

enable &#160;

recovery &#160;

of &#160;

data &#160;

and &#160;

business &#160;

operations &#160;

and 

address rebuilding &#160;

network capabilities &#160;

and restoring &#160;

data if &#160;

the institution &#160;

or its &#160;

critical service &#160;

providers fall &#160;

victim to &#160;

this type &#160;

of 

cyber-attack. If &#160;

we fail &#160;

to observe &#160;

the regulatory &#160;

guidance, we &#160;

could be &#160;

subject to &#160;

various regulatory &#160;

sanctions, including financial 

penalties. In November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory &#160;

agencies issued a final rule requiring banking &#160;

organizations, including 

Popular, &#160;

PNA, &#160;

BPPR and &#160;

PB, &#160;

to &#160;

notify their &#160;

primary federal &#160;

banking regulator &#160;

within &#160;

36 hours &#160;

of &#160;

determining that &#160;

a &#8220;notification 

incident&#8221; &#160;

has &#160;

occurred. &#160;

A &#160;

notification &#160;

incident &#160;

is &#160;

a &#160;

&#8220;computer-security &#160;

incident&#8221; &#160;

that &#160;

has &#160;

materially &#160;

disrupted &#160;

or &#160;

degraded, &#160;

or &#160;

is 

reasonably likely &#160;

to materially &#160;

disrupt or &#160;

degrade, the &#160;

banking organization&#8217;s &#160;

ability to &#160;

deliver services &#160;

to &#160;

a material &#160;

portion of &#160;

its 

customer base, &#160;

jeopardize the viability &#160;

of key &#160;

operations of the &#160;

banking organization, or &#160;

impact the stability &#160;

of the &#160;

financial sector. 

The final rule also requires specific and immediate &#160;

notifications by bank service providers that &#160;

become aware of similar incidents. 

State and foreign regulators &#160;

have also been increasingly active &#160;

in implementing privacy and cybersecurity &#160;

standards and 

regulations. Several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and 

providing detailed requirements with respect to these &#160;

programs, including data encryption requirements. In New York, &#160;

the NYSDFS 

requires &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions &#160;

regulated &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

NYSDFS, &#160;

including &#160;

PB, &#160;

to, &#160;

among &#160;

other &#160;

things, &#160;

(i) &#160;

establish &#160;

and &#160;

maintain &#160;

a 

cybersecurity program designed &#160;

to enhance the &#160;

confidentiality, integrity &#160;

and availability of &#160;

their information systems; &#160;

(ii) implement 

and maintain a written &#160;

cyber security policy setting forth &#160;

policies and procedures for the &#160;

protection of their information systems &#160;

and 

nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief &#160;

Information Security Officer. 

In &#160;

March &#160;

2022, &#160;

the &#160;

SEC &#160;

proposed &#160;

new &#160;

rules &#160;

that &#160;

would &#160;

require &#160;

registrants, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

Popular, &#160;

to &#160;

(i) &#160;

report &#160;

material 

cybersecurity incidents on &#160;

Form 8-K, &#160;

(ii) include updated &#160;

disclosure in Forms &#160;

10-K and &#160;

10-Q of &#160;

previously disclosed cybersecurity 

incidents, &#160;

and &#160;

disclose &#160;

previously &#160;

undisclosed, &#160;

individually &#160;

immaterial &#160;

incidents &#160;

when &#160;

a &#160;

determination &#160;

is &#160;

made &#160;

that &#160;

they &#160;

have 

become material on an aggregated basis, (iii) disclose cybersecurity policies and procedures and governance practices, including at 

the board and management levels, in Form 10-K &#160;

and (iv) disclose the board of directors&#8217; &#160;

cybersecurity expertise. 

Many states and foreign &#160;

governments have also recently implemented or &#160;

modified their data breach notification &#160;

and data 

privacy &#160;

requirements. The &#160;

California Consumer &#160;

Privacy Act &#160;

(&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) &#160;

imposes privacy &#160;

compliance obligations &#160;

with regard &#160;

to &#160;

the 

collection, &#160;

use &#160;

and &#160;

disclosure of &#160;

personal &#160;

information of &#160;

California residents, &#160;

and the &#160;

November 2020 &#160;

amendment to &#160;

the &#160;

CCPA 

creates the California Privacy Protection Agency, a watchdog privacy agency, and further expands the scope of businesses covered 

by the law &#160;

and certain rights relating &#160;

to personal information. The &#160;

substantive obligations under the &#160;

2020 amendment to the &#160;

CCPA 

became effective &#160;

on January &#160;

1, 2023. &#160;

In European &#160;

Union, the &#160;

General Data &#160;

Protection Regulation heightens &#160;

privacy compliance 

obligations &#160;

and &#160;

imposes &#160;

strict &#160;

standards &#160;

for &#160;

reporting &#160;

data &#160;

breaches. &#160;

We &#160;

expect &#160;

this &#160;

trend &#160;

to &#160;

continue &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

continually 

monitoring developments in the jurisdictions in which &#160;

we operate.

In 2021, the &#160;

OCC proposed principles to &#160;

provide for a framework &#160;

for the management of &#160;

climate-related risks for 

financial institutions and in 2022, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS each proposed principles or guidance with 

respect to &#160;

the management &#160;

of climate-related &#160;

risks for &#160;

financial institutions. Additionally, &#160;

in 2022, &#160;

the SEC &#160;

proposed rule &#160;

changes 

that &#160;

would &#160;

require &#160;

registrants, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

Popular, &#160;

to &#160;

disclose &#160;

information &#160;

about &#160;

climate-related &#160;

risks &#160;

and &#160;

certain &#160;

climate-related 

financial statement metrics. 

Incentive Compensation 

The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as &#160;

part of its regular, &#160;

risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation 

arrangements of &#160;

banking organizations, such &#160;

as Popular, &#160;

that are &#160;

not &#8220;large, &#160;

complex banking &#160;

organizations.&#8221; Deficiencies will &#160;

be 

incorporated into &#160;

the &#160;

organization&#8217;s supervisory &#160;

ratings, which &#160;

can &#160;

affect &#160;

the &#160;

organization&#8217;s ability &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

acquisitions and &#160;

take 

other &#160;

actions. Enforcement &#160;

actions may &#160;

be taken &#160;

against &#160;

a &#160;

banking &#160;

organization if &#160;

its &#160;

incentive compensation &#160;

arrangements, or 

related &#160;

risk-management &#160;

control &#160;

or &#160;

governance &#160;

processes, &#160;

pose &#160;

a &#160;

risk &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

organization&#8217;s &#160;

safety &#160;

and &#160;

soundness &#160;

and &#160;

the 

organization is not taking prompt and effective measures &#160;

to correct the deficiencies. 

The &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board, &#160;

OCC &#160;

and &#160;

FDIC &#160;

have &#160;

issued &#160;

comprehensive &#160;

final &#160;

guidance &#160;

on &#160;

incentive &#160;

compensation 

policies intended to discourage excessive risk-taking in &#160;

the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations &#160;

in order to not 

undermine &#160;

the &#160;

safety &#160;

and &#160;

soundness &#160;

of &#160;

such &#160;

organizations. &#160;

The &#160;

guidance, &#160;

which &#160;

covers &#160;

all &#160;

employees &#160;

that &#160;

have &#160;

the &#160;

ability &#160;

to 

materially affect &#160;

the risk &#160;

profile of an &#160;

organization, either individually &#160;

or as &#160;

part of &#160;

a group, &#160;

is based &#160;

upon the key &#160;

principles that a 

banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond 

the &#160;

organization&#8217;s &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

effectively &#160;

identify &#160;

and &#160;

manage &#160;

risks, &#160;

(ii) &#160;

be &#160;

compatible &#160;

with &#160;

effective &#160;

internal &#160;

controls &#160;

and &#160;

risk 

management, and (iii) &#160;

be supported by &#160;

strong corporate governance, &#160;

including active and &#160;

effective oversight &#160;

by the &#160;

organization&#8217;s 

board of directors. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the other federal banking 

agencies &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

SEC, &#160;

to &#160;

adopt &#160;

rules &#160;

prohibiting &#160;

incentive-based &#160;

payment &#160;

arrangements that &#160;

encourage &#160;

inappropriate &#160;

risks &#160;

by 

providing excessive &#160;

compensation or &#160;

that could &#160;

lead to &#160;

a material &#160;

financial loss &#160;

at specified &#160;

regulated entities &#160;

having at &#160;

least $1 

billion in total &#160;

assets (including Popular, &#160;

PNA, BPPR and &#160;

PB). The U.S. &#160;

financial regulators proposed revised &#160;

rules in 2016, &#160;

which 

have not been finalized. 

In October &#160;

2022, the SEC &#160;

adopted a final &#160;

rule requiring securities &#160;

exchanges to adopt &#160;

rules mandating, in &#160;

the case of &#160;

a 

restatement, the &#160;

recovery or &#160;

&#8220;clawback&#8221; of &#160;

excess incentive-based &#160;

compensation paid &#160;

to current &#160;

or former &#160;

executive officers &#160;

and 

requiring listed &#160;

issuers to &#160;

disclose any &#160;

recovery analysis where &#160;

recovery is &#160;

triggered by &#160;

a restatement. &#160;

The excess &#160;

compensation 

would be based &#160;

on the amount &#160;

the executive officer &#160;

would have received &#160;

had the incentive-based &#160;

compensation been determined 

using the &#160;

restated financials. The &#160;

final rule &#160;

requires the securities &#160;

exchanges to propose &#160;

conforming listing standards &#160;

by February 

26, &#160;

2023 &#160;

and &#160;

requires &#160;

the &#160;

standards &#160;

to &#160;

become &#160;

effective &#160;

no &#160;

later &#160;

than &#160;

November &#160;

28, &#160;

2023. &#160;

Each &#160;

listed &#160;

issuer, &#160;

which &#160;

includes 

Popular as a &#160;

listed issuer on &#160;

the Nasdaq Stock &#160;

Market, would then &#160;

be required to &#160;

adopt a clawback &#160;

policy within 60 &#160;

days after &#160;

its 

exchange&#8217;s &#160;

listing standard &#160;

has &#160;

become &#160;

effective. &#160;

Popular &#160;

will &#160;

work &#160;

to &#160;

implement these &#160;

new &#160;

requirements &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

rule &#160;

becomes 

effective.

Regulation of Reinsurers, Insurance Producers and &#160;

Agents

Popular&#8217;s subsidiaries that are engaged in &#160;

insurance agency and producer activities are &#160;

subject to regulatory supervision 

by the Puerto &#160;

Rico Office of &#160;

the Commissioner of Insurance &#160;

and to insurance laws &#160;

and regulations requiring licensing &#160;

of insurance 

producers and &#160;

agents. Popular&#8217;s &#160;

reinsurance subsidiaries &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

licensure and &#160;

regulatory supervision &#160;

by the &#160;

Puerto Rico 

Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and &#160;

to insurance laws and regulations requiring, among &#160;

other things, minimum capital and 

solvency standards, financial reporting, restrictions on &#160;

the amount of dividends payable, record &#160;

keeping and examinations. 

Puerto Rico Regulation 

As &#160;

a &#160;

commercial &#160;

bank &#160;

organized &#160;

under &#160;

the &#160;

laws &#160;

of &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

is &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

supervision, &#160;

examination &#160;

and 

regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended 

(the &#8220;Banking Law&#8221;). 

Section 27 &#160;

of the &#160;

Banking Law &#160;

requires that &#160;

at &#160;

least ten &#160;

percent (10%) &#160;

of the &#160;

yearly net &#160;

income of &#160;

BPPR be &#160;

credited 

annually to a reserve &#160;

fund. The apportionment must be &#160;

done every year until the &#160;

reserve fund is equal to &#160;

the total of paid-in &#160;

capital 

on common and preferred stock. During 2022, $76.9 &#160;

million was transferred to the statutory reserve &#160;

account. 

Section &#160;

27 &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Banking &#160;

Law &#160;

also &#160;

provides that &#160;

when &#160;

the &#160;

expenditures &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

bank &#160;

are &#160;

greater &#160;

than &#160;

its &#160;

receipts, the 

excess of the &#160;

former over the latter &#160;

must be charged &#160;

against the undistributed profits &#160;

of the bank, and &#160;

the balance, if &#160;

any, must &#160;

be 

charged against &#160;

the reserve &#160;

fund. &#160;

If the &#160;

reserve fund &#160;

is &#160;

not sufficient &#160;

to &#160;

cover such &#160;

balance in &#160;

whole or &#160;

in part, &#160;

the outstanding 

amount must be charged against &#160;

the capital account and no &#160;

dividend may be declared until capital &#160;

has been restored to its &#160;

original 

amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original &#160;

capital. 

Section 16 of the &#160;

Banking Law requires every &#160;

bank to maintain a &#160;

legal reserve that, except &#160;

as otherwise provided by &#160;

the 

Office of &#160;

the Commissioner, &#160;

may not be &#160;

less than 20% &#160;

of its &#160;

demand liabilities, excluding &#160;

government deposits (federal, &#160;

state and 

municipal) that &#160;

are secured &#160;

by collateral. &#160;

If a &#160;

bank is &#160;

authorized to &#160;

establish one &#160;

or more &#160;

bank branches &#160;

in a &#160;

state of &#160;

the United 

States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state &#160;

or country, the Office of the 

Commissioner &#160;

may &#160;

exempt &#160;

said &#160;

branch &#160;

or &#160;

branches &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

reserve &#160;

requirements &#160;

of &#160;

Section &#160;

16. &#160;

Pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

an &#160;

order &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board &#160;

dated &#160;

November &#160;

24, &#160;

1982, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

exempted &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

reserve &#160;

requirements &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Federal 

Reserve &#160;

System &#160;

with &#160;

respect &#160;

to &#160;

deposits &#160;

payable &#160;

in &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico. &#160;

Accordingly, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

is &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

reserve &#160;

requirement 

prescribed by the Banking Law. During 2022, BPPR was in compliance &#160;

with the statutory reserve requirement. 

Section 17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to &#160;

any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an 

aggregate amount of &#160;

fifteen percent (15%) &#160;

of the paid-in &#160;

capital and reserve fund &#160;

of the bank. &#160;

As of December &#160;

31, 2022, the &#160;

legal 

lending limit &#160;

for BPPR &#160;

under this &#160;

provision was &#160;

approximately $334 &#160;

million. In &#160;

the case &#160;

of loans &#160;

which are &#160;

secured by &#160;

collateral 

worth at &#160;

least 25% more &#160;

than the amount &#160;

of the &#160;

loan, the &#160;

maximum aggregate amount &#160;

of such secured &#160;

loans is &#160;

increased to &#160;

one 

third of &#160;

the paid-in capital &#160;

of the bank, &#160;

plus its reserve &#160;

fund. In no &#160;

event may the &#160;

total of unsecured &#160;

and secured loans &#160;

to any one 

person, firm, partnership or corporation exceed an aggregate amount of 33 1/3% of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. 

If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated &#160;

1 in the last examination performed by the Office &#160;

of the Commissioner or any 

regulatory agency, &#160;

its legal &#160;

lending limit &#160;

shall also &#160;

include 15% &#160;

of 50% &#160;

of its &#160;

undivided profits &#160;

and for &#160;

loans secured &#160;

by collateral 

worth at &#160;

least 25% &#160;

more than &#160;

the amount &#160;

of the &#160;

loan, the &#160;

capital of &#160;

the bank &#160;

shall also &#160;

include 33 &#160;

1/3% of &#160;

50% of &#160;

its undivided 

profits. Institutions rated 2 &#160;

in their last &#160;

regulatory examination may include this &#160;

additional component in their &#160;

legal lending limit &#160;

only 

with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section 17 on the amount of loans 

that are wholly secured &#160;

by bonds, securities and &#160;

other evidence of indebtedness &#160;

of the Government of &#160;

the United States or &#160;

Puerto 

Rico, &#160;

or &#160;

by &#160;

current &#160;

debt &#160;

bonds, &#160;

not &#160;

in &#160;

default, &#160;

of &#160;

municipalities &#160;

or &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

of &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico. &#160;

During &#160;

2022, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

was &#160;

in 

compliance with the lending limit requirements of Section &#160;

17 of the Banking Law. 

Section &#160;

14 &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Banking Law &#160;

authorizes a &#160;

bank to &#160;

conduct certain &#160;

financial &#160;

and &#160;

related &#160;

activities directly &#160;

or &#160;

through 

subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and originating and servicing &#160;

mortgage loans. BPPR engages in finance 

leasing through &#160;

its wholly-owned &#160;

subsidiary, &#160;

Popular Auto, &#160;

LLC, which &#160;

is organized &#160;

and operates &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico. The &#160;

origination 

and servicing of mortgage loans is conducted by &#160;

Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR. 

With &#160;

respect to &#160;

information privacy, &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

law &#160;

requires businesses &#160;

to &#160;

implement information &#160;

security &#160;

controls to 

protect &#160;

consumers&#8217; &#160;

personal &#160;
