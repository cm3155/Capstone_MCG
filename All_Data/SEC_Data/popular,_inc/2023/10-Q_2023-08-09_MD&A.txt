&#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest earning &#160;

assets include &#160;

investment securities &#160;

and loans &#160;

that are &#160;

exempt from &#160;

income tax, &#160;

principally in 

Puerto Rico. &#160;

The main &#160;

sources of &#160;

tax-exempt interest &#160;

income are &#160;

certain investments &#160;

in obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

U. S. &#160;

Government, its 

agencies and &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

certain obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

and/or its &#160;

agencies and &#160;

municipalities, 

and assets &#160;

held by the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s international banking &#160;

entities. To &#160;

facilitate the comparison &#160;

of interest related &#160;

to these &#160;

assets, 

the &#160;

interest &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

converted &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis, &#160;

using &#160;

the &#160;

applicable &#160;

statutory &#160;

income &#160;

tax &#160;

rates &#160;

for &#160;

each &#160;

period. &#160;

According to the &#160;

Puerto Rico tax &#160;

law, a &#160;

portion of interest &#160;

cost, based on &#160;

an equal proportion &#160;

of tax-exempt assets to &#160;

total assets, 

and an &#160;

allocation of &#160;

general and &#160;

administrative expenses &#160;

should be &#160;

attributed to &#160;

exempt income, &#160;

reducing the &#160;

benefit of &#160;

the tax 

exempt income, and as such &#160;

the disallowance of such &#160;

deduction is considered in the &#160;

taxable equivalent computation. The effective 

yield, on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, will &#160;

vary depending on &#160;

the level &#160;

of these expenses &#160;

that are &#160;

attributed to the &#160;

available exempt 

income. 

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

is a &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measure. Management &#160;

believes that &#160;

this presentation 

provides meaningful &#160;

information since &#160;

it facilitates &#160;

the comparison &#160;

of &#160;

revenues arising &#160;

from taxable &#160;

and tax-exempt &#160;

sources. Net 

interest &#160;

income &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis &#160;

is &#160;

presented &#160;

with &#160;

its &#160;

different &#160;

components &#160;

in &#160;

Tables &#160;

2 &#160;

and &#160;

3, &#160;

along &#160;

with &#160;

the 

reconciliation &#160;

to &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

(GAAP), &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023 &#160;

as &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

period &#160;

in &#160;

2022, 

segregated by major categories of interest earning &#160;

assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures &#160;

used by &#160;

the Corporation may &#160;

not be &#160;

comparable to &#160;

similarly named &#160;

non-GAAP financial measures 

used by other companies. 

Financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 

&#9679;

&#160;

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

recorded net &#160;

income of &#160;

$ 151.2 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to net &#160;

income of &#160;

$ 

211.4 &#160;

million for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin for &#160;

the &#160;

second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023 &#160;

was 3.14%, &#160;

an 

increase of 5 basis &#160;

points when compared to 3.09% &#160;

for the same quarter of &#160;

the previous year, &#160;

mainly due to higher &#160;

yield from 

money &#160;

market &#160;

investments &#160;

and &#160;

loans, &#160;

which &#160;

was &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

higher &#160;

deposits &#160;

costs, &#160;

principally &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

public sector. &#160;

On a &#160;

taxable equivalent &#160;

basis, the &#160;

net interest &#160;

margin was &#160;

3.29%, compared to &#160;

3.45% for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of 

the previous year. For the quarter ended June 30, &#160;

2023, the Corporation recorded a provision for credit losses of $37.2 million, 

compared to &#160;

$9.4 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

The higher &#160;

provision for &#160;

2023 is &#160;

attributed to &#160;

higher loan 

volumes, &#160;

migrations &#160;

in &#160;

credit &#160;

scores &#160;

and &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

economic &#160;

variables &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios. &#160;

Non-interest 

income was &#160;

$160.5 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter, &#160;

an increase &#160;

of $3.1 &#160;

million when &#160;

compared to &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2022, 

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

other &#160;

service &#160;

fees, &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

higher &#160;

credit &#160;

card &#160;

activities &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

revenue &#160;

sharing 

agreement &#160;

with &#160;

Evertec, &#160;

Inc, &#160;

and &#160;

net &#160;

gains &#160;

in &#160;

equity &#160;

securities, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

mortgage &#160;

banking 

activities &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

fair &#160;

value &#160;

adjustments &#160;

of &#160;

MSRs &#160;

and &#160;

lower &#160;

service &#160;

charges &#160;

on &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts. &#160;

Operating 

expenses were higher by $54.0 million principally &#160;

due to higher personnel costs and professional &#160;

fees. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Total &#160;

assets at June &#160;

30, 2023 amounted to &#160;

$70.8 billion, compared to &#160;

$67.6 billion, at &#160;

December 31, 2022. &#160;

The increase was 

mainly due to &#160;

higher money market &#160;

investments, &#160;

driven by the &#160;

increase in deposits, &#160;

and loan growth, &#160;

partially offset by &#160;

lower 

debt securities available-for-sale, as the &#160;

Corporation has maintained higher balances in &#160;

Fed Funds reserves due to &#160;

the recent 

banking sector turmoil. 

&#9679;

Total &#160;

deposits at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023 increased &#160;

by $2.8 &#160;

billion when &#160;

compared to &#160;

deposits at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022, mainly &#160;

due to 

higher Puerto Rico public sector deposits by $3.3 &#160;

billion.

&#9679;

&#160;

Stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $4.6 billion at June 30, 2023, an increase of $471.6 &#160;

million when compared to December 31, 2022, 

principally due &#160;

to net &#160;

income for &#160;

the six-months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023 &#160;

of $310.1 &#160;

million, the &#160;

after-tax impact &#160;

of the &#160;

favorable 

variance &#160;

in &#160;

net &#160;

unrealized &#160;

losses &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

of &#160;

available-for-sale &#160;

securities &#160;

of &#160;

$121.8 &#160;

million, &#160;

the &#160;

amortization &#160;

of &#160;

the 

unrealized losses &#160;

from securities &#160;

previously reclassified &#160;

to held-to-maturity &#160;

of $68.0 &#160;

million, and &#160;

the positive &#160;

impact of &#160;

$28.8 

million from the adoption &#160;

of a new accounting standard &#160;

on January 1, 2023, partially &#160;

offset by dividends declared for &#160;

the year-

to-date period. 

&#9679;

&#160;

At June 30, &#160;

2023, the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book &#160;

value per common share &#160;

was $51.37, an increase of &#160;

$6.40 from December 

31, 2022 due mainly to the increase in Stockholders&#8217; &#160;

equity during the period. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Capital ratios &#160;

continued to &#160;

be strong. &#160;

As of &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s common &#160;

equity tier &#160;

1 capital &#160;

ratio was &#160;

16.87%, 

the tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.40%, and the &#160;

total capital ratio was 18.74%. Refer to Table 9 for capital ratios. 

Refer to &#160;

the Operating &#160;

Results Analysis &#160;

and Financial &#160;

Condition Analysis &#160;

within this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

additional discussion &#160;

of significant 

quarterly variances and items impacting the financial performance &#160;

of the Corporation. 

As a financial services company, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected &#160;

by general business and economic conditions 

in the &#160;

markets which &#160;

we serve. &#160;

Lending and &#160;

deposit activities &#160;

and fee &#160;

income generation &#160;

are influenced &#160;

by the &#160;

level of &#160;

business 

spending and &#160;

investment, consumer &#160;

income, spending &#160;

and savings, &#160;

capital market &#160;

activities, competition, &#160;

customer preferences, 

interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates &#160;

on competing products. 

The Corporation &#160;

operates in &#160;

a highly &#160;

regulated environment &#160;

and may &#160;

be adversely &#160;

affected by &#160;

changes in &#160;

federal and &#160;

local laws 

and regulations. Also, competition with other financial institutions &#160;

could adversely affect its profitability. 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

continuously &#160;

monitors &#160;

general &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

industry-related &#160;

indicators &#160;

and &#160;

trends, 

competition, interest rate volatility, credit &#160;

quality indicators, loan and deposit demand, operational and systems efficiencies, revenue 

enhancements and changes in the regulation of financial &#160;

services companies. &#160;

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES &#160;

The accounting &#160;

and reporting &#160;

policies followed &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation and &#160;

its subsidiaries &#160;

conform to &#160;

generally accepted &#160;

accounting 

principles &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States &#160;

of &#160;

America &#160;

and &#160;

general &#160;

practices &#160;

within &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

industry. &#160;

Various &#160;

elements &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by &#160;

their nature, are &#160;

inherently subject to &#160;

estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and &#160;

other 

subjective assessments. &#160;

These estimates &#160;

are made &#160;

under facts &#160;

and circumstances &#160;

at a &#160;

point in &#160;

time and &#160;

changes in &#160;

those facts 

and circumstances could produce actual results that differ &#160;

from those estimates. &#160;

Management has discussed &#160;

the development and &#160;

selection of the &#160;

critical accounting policies &#160;

and estimates with &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s 

Audit &#160;

Committee. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

identified &#160;

as &#160;

critical &#160;

accounting &#160;

policies &#160;

those &#160;

related &#160;

to: &#160;

(i) &#160;

Fair &#160;

Value &#160;

Measurement &#160;

of 

Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans &#160;

and Allowance for Credit &#160;

Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired &#160;

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest &#160;

income for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023 &#160;

was $531.7 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$533.9 million &#160;

in the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of 

2022, &#160;

a &#160;

decrease of &#160;

$2.2 million. &#160;

Net &#160;

interest income &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

taxable equivalent &#160;

basis for &#160;

the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023 &#160;

was &#160;

$558.4 

million &#160;

compared to &#160;

$595.5 million &#160;

in the &#160;

second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2022. The &#160;

decrease in &#160;

the taxable &#160;

equivalent net &#160;

interest income &#160;

is 

related &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

higher &#160;

disallowed &#160;

interest &#160;

expense &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

tax &#160;

computation. &#160;

The &#160;

latter &#160;

results &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s interest &#160;

expense that &#160;

is attributable &#160;

to the &#160;

tax-exempt income. &#160;

A significant &#160;

driver to &#160;

the increased &#160;

interest expense 

has been the cost of Puerto Rico government deposits, which are indexed to market rates, has increased by 3.46% when compared 

with the same quarter of 2022. &#160;

Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.14% compared to 3.09% &#160;

in the second quarter of 2022 or an increase of &#160;

5 basis points. On 

a taxable equivalent basis, net &#160;

interest margin for the second &#160;

quarter of 2023 was 3.29%, compared &#160;

to 3.45% for the &#160;

same quarter 

the prior year. The main variances in net interest income on a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis were: 

Negative variances: &#160;

&#9679;

Higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$215.7 million &#160;

due to &#160;

the increase &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates that &#160;

has resulted &#160;

in a &#160;

higher 

cost in most deposit categories in &#160;

both Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#8220;BPPR&#8221;) &#160;

and Popular Bank (&#8220;PB&#8221; or &#8220;Popular U.S. 

Operations&#8221;); but particularly from Puerto Rico &#160;

government deposits for BPPR. &#160;

The higher costs have been offset &#160;

in part 

by lower volume &#160;

of average interest-bearing &#160;

deposits by $1.6 &#160;

billion mainly related &#160;

to a &#160;

decrease in commercial &#160;

savings 

accounts. 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

Higher interest income &#160;

from money market, &#160;

investment, and trading securities &#160;

by $61.8 million &#160;

driven mainly by &#160;

a higher 

yield of &#160;

money market investments, &#160;

which reflects an &#160;

increase of &#160;

432 basis points &#160;

related to the &#160;

increase in &#160;

the Federal 

funds rate, partially offset by a lower average volume of $4.1 billion and a lower benefit from exempt investment securities 

related to a higher disallowed interest expense in the Puerto Rico &#160;

tax computation, stemming from the increase in the cost 

of deposits. 

&#9679;

Higher &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

loans &#160;

by &#160;

$125.4 &#160;

million &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

average &#160;

loans &#160;

by &#160;

$2.8 

billion reflecting increases &#160;

in both PB and &#160;

BPPR and across most &#160;

major lending segments. Loan &#160;

origination 

in a &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate environment &#160;

and the &#160;

repricing of &#160;

adjustable-rate loans &#160;

resulted in a &#160;

higher yield &#160;

on 

loans by 101 basis points. The categories with the highest impact were commercial loans with an increase of 

$80.9 million &#160;

in interest &#160;

income, or &#160;

136 basis &#160;

points, and &#160;

consumer loans &#160;

which increased &#160;

$26.4 million &#160;

in 

interest income, or 188 basis points. &#160;

Net interest income for the BPPR segment amounted to $453.1 &#160;

million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $447.8 million &#160;

in 

the second quarter of 2022. Net interest margin increased to 3.21% &#160;

compared to 3.02% in the second quarter of 2022. The increase 

in net interest income of $5.3 million was driven by a higher yield on &#160;

earning assets related to a higher interest rate environment and 

a higher &#160;

volume of &#160;

loans, partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

the increase &#160;

in the &#160;

cost of &#160;

deposits, mainly &#160;

from the &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public sector &#160;

deposits. The 

cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 176 basis points to 1.95% from 0.19% in the same quarter of 2022. Total deposit cost for 

the quarter increased by 130 basis points, from &#160;

0.14% in the second quarter of 2022 to 1.44%. 

Net interest income for PB was $87.5 million &#160;

for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared &#160;

to $93.4 million during the second 

quarter of 2022, a decrease of $5.9 million. &#160;

Net interest margin decreased 75 basis &#160;

points when compared to the second quarter &#160;

of 

2022 to 3.01%. The decrease in net interest &#160;

margin was mostly driven by a higher &#160;

cost of deposits, partially offset by the increase in 

loan volume and yield of loans due to origination &#160;

of loans in a higher interest rate environment &#160;

and the repricing of adjustable-rate 

loans. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was &#160;

3.02% compared to 0.54%, or an increase of &#160;

248 basis points, while total deposit 

cost was 2.55% &#160;

compared to 0.42% in the second quarter &#160;

of 2022.

Note: The changes that are not due solely to volume or &#160;

rate are allocated to volume and rate based on the &#160;

proportion of the change in each category. 

[1] Average balances exclude unrealized gains or losses &#160;

on debt securities available-for-sale and the unrealized &#160;

loss related to certain securities transferred from 

available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. 

[2] Includes interest bearing demand deposits corresponding &#160;

to certain government entities in Puerto Rico. 

Net interest income for &#160;

the six-months ended June 30, &#160;

2023 was $1.1 billion, &#160;

or $35.2 million higher than &#160;

the same period in &#160;

2022. 

Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of $14.9 million when compared to the same period in 2022. Net 

interest margin &#160;

was 3.18%, &#160;

an increase &#160;

of 26 &#160;

basis points &#160;

when compared &#160;

to 2.92% &#160;

in 2022. &#160;

The increase &#160;

in net &#160;

interest margin 

was mainly &#160;

driven by a &#160;

higher yield on &#160;

earning assets due &#160;

to a &#160;

higher interest rate &#160;

environment. Net interest &#160;

margin, on &#160;

a taxable 

equivalent basis, for the six-months ended June &#160;

30, 2023, was 3.37%, an increase of &#160;

13 basis points when compared to the 3.24% 

for the same period of 2022. The drivers of &#160;

the variances in net interest income for the &#160;

six-months are: &#160;

Negative variances: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

expense from &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$384.1 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

yield by &#160;

127 basis &#160;

points related &#160;

to a &#160;

higher 

interest rate environment. 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

investment securities, &#160;

trading &#160;

and money &#160;

market investments &#160;

by &#160;

$142.0 resulting &#160;

from &#160;

higher 

yield of the portfolio by 111 &#160;

basis points mainly driven by money market investments, which reflects an average yield increase 

of 448 &#160;

basis points, related &#160;

to the &#160;

interest rate environment, &#160;

partially offset by &#160;

lower volume by &#160;

$6.4 billion linked &#160;

to a &#160;

lower 

volume of &#160;

deposits on &#160;

both Puerto Rico &#160;

Government deposits and &#160;

commercial savings &#160;

deposits. In the &#160;

first quarter &#160;

of 2022 

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Government &#160;

deposits &#160;

decreased &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

payments &#160;

made &#160;

by &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Plan &#160;

of 

Adjustment &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

under &#160;

Oversight, &#160;

Management, &#160;

and &#160;

Economic &#160;

Stability &#160;

Act 

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;). 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest income from commercial loans by &#160;

$154.2 million due to higher yield by &#160;

130 basis points and higher volume of 

$2.0 billion. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

consumer loans &#160;

by $52.0 &#160;

million mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

a higher &#160;

average volume of &#160;

personal loans &#160;

and 

credit cards. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest income from construction loans by $10.7 &#160;

million due to higher yield by 310 basis points. 

Prepayment penalties, &#160;

late fees &#160;

collected and &#160;

the amortization &#160;

of premiums &#160;

on purchased &#160;

loans are &#160;

included as &#160;

part of &#160;

the loan 

yield. Interest income related to these items for the six-months ended June 30, 2023, amounted to $12.8 million, compared to $28.9 

million &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

period &#160;

of &#160;

2022. &#160;

The &#160;

decrease &#160;

of &#160;

$16.1 &#160;

million &#160;

is &#160;

mainly &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

lower &#160;

amortized &#160;

fees &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

the 

forgiveness of PPP loans, lower amortization of premium &#160;

on auto loans purchased and resulting &#160;

from the cancellation of PCD loans.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio &#160;

and Unfunded Commitments 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation recorded an expense of $37.8 &#160;

million for its reserve for credit losses related to 

loans held-in-portfolio and &#160;

unfunded commitments. The &#160;

provision for credit &#160;

loss related to &#160;

the loans-held-in-portfolio for &#160;

the quarter 

ended June 30, 2023 &#160;

was $35.7 million, compared to &#160;

a provision expense of $9.9 &#160;

million for the quarter ended &#160;

June 30, 2022. The 

provision expense &#160;

was mainly &#160;

driven by &#160;

specific reserves &#160;

for collateral &#160;

dependent U.S. &#160;

commercial and &#160;

P.R. &#160;

construction loans,

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by 

changes in the assignments of &#160;

probability weights to macroeconomic scenarios and &#160;

reduction in qualitative reserves. The &#160;

provision 

related &#160;

to &#160;

unfunded &#160;

commitments &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

second &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2023 &#160;

was &#160;

$2.2 &#160;

million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

reserve &#160;

release &#160;

related &#160;

to 

unfunded commitments of $0.2 million for the same &#160;

period of 2022. &#160;

For the quarter ended &#160;

June 30, 2023, the &#160;

Corporation recorded a provision for &#160;

credit loss of $28.4 &#160;

million for loans-held-in-portfolio 

for the &#160;

BPPR segment, &#160;

compared to &#160;

a provision &#160;

expense of &#160;

$9.1 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2022. The &#160;

Popular U.S. 

segment recorded &#160;

a provision &#160;

of $7.3 &#160;

million for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

compared to &#160;

a provision &#160;

of $0.7 &#160;

million for &#160;

the 

same quarter in 2022. &#160;

For the six-months ended June 30,2023, the Corporation recorded a provision for credit loss of $85.6 million for its reserve for credit 

losses related to loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio and unfunded commitments. &#160;

The provision expense related to &#160;

the loans-held-in-portfolio for 

the six-months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30,2023 was &#160;

$82.8 million, &#160;

$4.5 million &#160;

for the &#160;

30,2022. &#160;

The &#160;

higher &#160;

provision &#160;

in &#160;

2023 &#160;

is &#160;

attributable &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

volumes, &#160;

migrations &#160;

in &#160;

scores &#160;

and &#160;

changes &#160;

in 

economic variables &#160;

related to &#160;

portfolios. The &#160;

provision for &#160;

unfunded commitments &#160;

for the &#160;

six-months ended &#160;

June 

30,2023 reflected an expense of $2.8 million, &#160;

At June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

the total &#160;

allowance for &#160;

credit losses &#160;

for loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio amounted to &#160;

$700.2 million, &#160;

compared to &#160;

$720.3 

million as of December 31, 2022. &#160;

The ratio of the allowance &#160;

for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was &#160;

2.12% at June 30, 2023, 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

2.25% &#160;

2022. &#160;

During &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation adopted &#160;

ASU &#160;

2022-02 &#160;

which &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

a 

reduction of approximately $46 million, $29 million net of tax, in the reserve related to &#160;

TDR which was recorded as an adjustment to 

the beginning balance of retained earnings. &#160;

As discussed in Note 9 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements, within the process &#160;

to 

estimate its &#160;

ACL, the &#160;

Corporation applies probability &#160;

weightings to the &#160;

outcomes of simulations &#160;

using Moody&#8217;s Analytics&#8217; &#160;

Baseline, 

S3 (pessimistic) and S1 (optimistic) scenarios. The baseline scenario is assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic 

scenario given &#160;

the uncertainties &#160;

in the &#160;

economic outlook &#160;

and downside &#160;

risk. During &#160;

the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023, the &#160;

Corporation 

further increased the probability weight assigned to the baseline scenario resulting in a decrease in the ACL of $5.8 million. Refer to 

Note 9 &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$160.5 &#160;

million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June &#160;

2023, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$157.4 &#160;

million &#160;

for the &#160;

same 

quarter of the previous year. The main factors that contributed to the variance &#160;

in non-interest income were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

other &#160;

service &#160;

fees &#160;

by &#160;

$12.8 million, &#160;

principally &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

to &#160;

higher credit &#160;

primarily related &#160;

to &#160;

securities &#160;

held &#160;

for 

benefit plans which have an offsetting effect in personnel &#160;

costs; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income from mortgage &#160;

banking activities by $11.3 &#160;

million due to an &#160;

unfavorable variance of $8.5 million &#160;

in the fair value

the Corporation &#160;

determined to &#160;

retain its &#160;

FHA/VA-guaranteed 

mortgage loan originations as held-for-investment &#160;

in the third quarter of 2022; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower service charges &#160;

on deposit accounts by &#160;

$4.0 million mainly &#160;

due to lower &#160;

returned ACH fees due &#160;

to the change in &#160;

policy 

of eliminating insufficient funds and modifying overdraft fees &#160;

implemented in the third quarter of 2022. 

Non-interest income amounted to &#160;

$322.4 million for &#160;

the six months ended &#160;

June 30, 2023, &#160;

compared to $312.1 million &#160;

for the same 

period of the previous year. The main factors that contributed to the &#160;

variance in non-interest income were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

service fees &#160;

by $25.8 &#160;

million, principally &#160;

at the &#160;

primarily related &#160;

to &#160;

held &#160;

for 

benefit plans which have an offsetting effect in personnel &#160;

costs; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income from mortgage banking activities by $16.7 million due to an unfavorable variance of $10.9 million in the fair value 

adjustments &#160;

of &#160;

by $10.1 million &#160;

mainly due to &#160;

lower returned ACH &#160;

million due to &#160;

the 

change in policy of eliminating insufficient funds and &#160;

modifying overdraft fees implemented in the third &#160;

quarter of 2022. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses amounted to $460.3 million for the &#160;

quarter ended June 30, 2023, an &#160;

increase of $54.0 million, when compared 

with the same quarter of 2022. The variance &#160;

in operating expenses was driven primarily by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs &#160;

by $22.7 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

salaries by &#160;

Income Taxes 

For the quarter &#160;

and six months &#160;

ended June 30, &#160;

2023, the corporation recorded &#160;

an income tax &#160;

expense of $43.5 and &#160;

$89.8 million, 

respectively, with an &#160;

effective tax rate (ETR) of &#160;

22.4%, and $22.5%, &#160;

respectively, compared to &#160;

income tax expense of $64.2 million 

and $114.7 million &#160;

with an effective tax rate of &#160;

23.3% and 21.3% for the quarter &#160;

and six months ended June 30, 2022, &#160;

respectively. 

The decrease in income tax expense for the quarter &#160;

and six months period ended June 30, 2023, &#160;

reflects the impact of lower pre-tax 

income. 

At June 30, 2023, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset amounting to $0.9 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.5 billion. 

The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. &#160;

operations was $0.3 billion, net of &#160;

a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion. 

Refer to &#160;

Note 31 &#160;

Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements for &#160;

a reconciliation &#160;

of the &#160;

statutory income &#160;

tax rate &#160;

to the &#160;

effective tax 

rate and additional information on the income &#160;

tax expense and deferred tax asset balances. 

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable segments &#160;

for managerial &#160;

reporting purposes &#160;

consist of &#160;

Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

Popular 

U.S. A Corporate group &#160;

has been defined to support the reportable &#160;

segments. &#160;

&#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable &#160;

segments, &#160;

including &#160;

additional &#160;

financial &#160;

information &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

underlying 

management accounting process, refer to Note 33 &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

The Corporate group reported a net income of $4.7 million for the quarter &#160;

ended June 30, 2023, compared with a net income of $4.8 

million for the same quarter of the previous year. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Corporate group reported net income 

of $6.0 million, compared to a net income of $11.1 million for the same period of the previous year. The decrease in net income was 

attributed to the equity pickup of $15.0 million for &#160;

the six months ended June 30,2022 from the investment in Evertec, Inc &#160;

that is not 

reflected in 2023 as the Corporation sold its entire &#160;

ownership stake in Evertec in August 2022. &#160;

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable &#160;

segments are discussed below: 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico &#160;

The Banco &#160;

Popular de &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

reportable segment&#8217;s &#160;

net income &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$131.8 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

June 30, 

2023, compared &#160;

with net &#160;

income of &#160;

$179.6 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The factors &#160;

that contributed &#160;

to the 

variance in the financial results included the following: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $5.3 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

money &#160;

market &#160;

and &#160;

investment &#160;

securities &#160;

by &#160;

$89.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher 

yields driven by the increase in interest rates, 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by $87.8 million mainly &#160;

due to higher average balances from commercial and 

consumer loans, mainly from credit cards and personal &#160;

loans, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$171.7 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs on &#160;

the market-linked &#160;

Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact on &#160;

the cost &#160;

of &#160;

NOW accounts, 

time deposits, and savings deposits. 

The &#160;

net &#160;

interest &#160;

margin &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023 &#160;

was &#160;

3.21% &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

3.02% &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter &#160;

in &#160;

the 

previous year. The &#160;

increase in net interest margin is &#160;

driven by higher yields from investments securities &#160;

and loans, particularly 

commercial and consumer loans, due to the increase &#160;

in rates; &#160;

partially offset by higher cost of deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

A provision &#160;

for loan &#160;

losses expense &#160;

of $29.3 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision expense &#160;

of $8.8 &#160;

million in &#160;

quarter ended 

June 30, 2022, or an unfavorable variance of $20.5 million mainly driven &#160;

by specific reserves for collateral dependent P.R. 

construction loans, changes in macroeconomic scenarios and higher loan volumes and migration &#160;

of P.R. &#160;

consumer credit 

scores, partially offset by changes in the assignments of probability weights to macroeconomic scenarios and reduction in 

qualitative reserves; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was lower by $0.6 million mainly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income &#160;

from mortgage banking &#160;

activities by $11.0 &#160;

million mainly due &#160;

to an &#160;

unfavorable variance of &#160;

$9.0 

million in &#160;

the fair &#160;

value adjustment &#160;

of mortgage &#160;

service rights &#160;

and lower &#160;

gains &#160;

of $2.1 &#160;

million from &#160;

derivative 

positions &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

lower &#160;

securitization &#160;

activity &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

determined to &#160;

retain &#160;

its &#160;

FHA/VA-guaranteed 

mortgage loan originations as held-for-investment &#160;

in the third quarter 2022. 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower service charges on &#160;

deposit accounts by $3.7 &#160;

million, mainly due to &#160;

lower ACH fees due &#160;

to the change in 

policy of eliminating insufficient fund fees and modifying &#160;

overdraft fees implemented in the third quarter &#160;

of 2022, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher &#160;

other &#160;

service &#160;

fees &#160;

by &#160;

$11.6 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher credit &#160;

card &#160;

fees &#160;

by &#160;

$4.5 &#160;

million &#160;

as &#160;

result &#160;

of 

higher &#160;

interchange &#160;

transactional &#160;

volumes, &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

merchant &#160;

acquiring &#160;

fees &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

revenue &#160;

sharing 

agreement with Evertec Inc. by $4.0 million. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $48.3 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $15.2 million driven by higher salaries due to minimum and other salary adjustments, 

and increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

business &#160;

promotions &#160;

by &#160;

$3.6 &#160;

million &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

customer &#160;

rewards &#160;

expense &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

higher 

transactional volumes; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower net recoveries from OREO by &#160;

$4.6 million mainly due to lower average &#160;

gain per unit partially offset &#160;

by an 

increase in units sold; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

other &#160;

operating &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$10.1 &#160;

million &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

$4.4 &#160;

million &#160;

of &#160;

higher &#160;

pension &#160;

expense &#160;

based &#160;

on 

actuarial assumptions and &#160;

higher charges allocated &#160;

from the &#160;

Corporate segment group &#160;

by $7.4 million, &#160;

mainly 

from higher personnel costs and higher consulting &#160;

fees, including those related to the transformation &#160;

initiative; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher professional fees of $10.9 million mainly due to &#160;

costs associated with several ongoing initiatives focused 

on regulatory, compliance and cyber security efforts as well the Corporations transformation &#160;

initiative; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

transactional &#160;

services &#160;

by &#160;

$5.8 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

credit &#160;

and &#160;

debit &#160;

card 

processing &#160;

expense &#160;

as &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

higher &#160;

transactional &#160;

volumes, &#160;

reflecting &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

customer &#160;

purchase 

activity; &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses by &#160;

$3.1 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

part due &#160;

to &#160;

expense savings &#160;

associated with &#160;

the 

acquired services from Evertec during the year 2022. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income tax expense by $16.3 million is mainly &#160;

due lower income before tax. &#160;

For the &#160;

six months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30,2023, the &#160;

BPPR segment &#160;

recorded net &#160;

income of &#160;

$264.7 million &#160;

compared to &#160;

a net &#160;

income of 

$358.2 million for the &#160;

same period of the &#160;

previous year. The &#160;

results for the six &#160;

months ended June 30,2022 &#160;

reflect a release of &#160;

the 

reserve &#160;

for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses &#160;

of &#160;

$4.9 million, &#160;

reflective of &#160;

the &#160;

credit &#160;

metrics &#160;

and &#160;

macroeconomic outlook, &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time, compared &#160;

to &#160;

a 

provision expense of $75.1 million for the &#160;

six months-period ended June 30,2023. The other factors &#160;

that contributed to the variance 

in the financial results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $39.9 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

money market &#160;

and &#160;

investment securities &#160;

by &#160;

$181.9 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher 

yields &#160;

from &#160;

money market &#160;

investments, &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

securities and &#160;

mortgage &#160;

backed &#160;

securities due &#160;

to &#160;

the 

increase in rates, 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by $165.7 million mainly due to &#160;

higher average balance from commercial and 

consumer loans; &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$307.2 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs on &#160;

the market-linked &#160;

Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, and &#160;

the &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact on &#160;

the cost &#160;

of &#160;

NOW accounts, 

time deposits, and savings deposits. 

The net &#160;

interest margin &#160;

for the &#160;

six months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30,2023 was &#160;

3.22% compared &#160;

to 2.84% &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

in the 

previous year. The increase in net interest margin is driven by earning &#160;

assets mix; partially offset by higher cost of deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

An unfavorable variance &#160;

of $80.0 million &#160;

on the provision &#160;

for loan losses, &#160;

due to the &#160;

reserve release in &#160;

2022, which was 

driven by changes in the credit metrics and the &#160;

macroeconomic outlook, at the time; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was higher by $10.9 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher other &#160;

service fees &#160;

by $24.3 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher credit card &#160;

fees by &#160;

$11.1 &#160;

million as &#160;

a net income &#160;

of $28.1 million for &#160;

the same quarter of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

The factors that contributed &#160;

to the variance &#160;

in the financial 

results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower &#160;

net interest income by $5.9 million due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$54.1 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

higher average 

balance of time deposits gathered through its direct &#160;

online channel, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$36.1 million, &#160;

mainly from &#160;

growth in &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio as &#160;

well as 

higher yields due to increase in rates; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income &#160;

from money market &#160;

and investment securities &#160;

by $13.1 million &#160;

due to &#160;

higher yields due 

to the increase in market rates. 

The net &#160;

interest margin for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, 2023 &#160;

was 3.01% &#160;

compared to &#160;

and unfunded commitments reflecting a provision 

of $7.9 &#160;

million for &#160;

the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision expense &#160;

of $0.6 &#160;

million recorded &#160;

in the &#160;

quarter 

ended June 30,2022, &#160;

mainly due to higher loan volumes and changes &#160;

in macroeconomic scenarios; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $5.4 million mostly &#160;

due to: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $1.2 million due to salary revisions &#160;

and increase in headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

operating expenses &#160;

by $2.2 &#160;

million due &#160;

to higher &#160;

charges allocated &#160;

from the &#160;

Corporate segment 

group by $1.8 million mainly from higher personnel costs &#160;

and higher consulting fees. 

&#9679;

&#160;

to a lower income before tax. 

For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the reportable segment of Popular &#160;

U.S. recorded a net income of $40.3 million, compared 

with a &#160;

net income &#160;

of $55.1 &#160;

million for &#160;

the same &#160;

period of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The results &#160;

for the &#160;

six months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30,2022 

reflect a &#160;

release of &#160;

the reserve &#160;

for credit &#160;

$1.4 million, &#160;

reflective of &#160;

macroeconomic outlook &#160;

at that 

time, compared to &#160;

a provision expense &#160;

of $10.0 million &#160;

for the six &#160;

months ended June &#160;

macroeconomic 

scenarios and loan growth. The other factors &#160;

that contributed to the variance in the financial results &#160;

included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

deposits by $91.6 million &#160;

mainly due to higher &#160;

rates and higher &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

the commercial &#160;

portfolio as &#160;

well as 

higher yields due to increase in rates; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher income &#160;

from money &#160;

market and &#160;

investment securities &#160;

by $19.4 &#160;

million due &#160;

to higher &#160;

yields and &#160;

higher

The net interest margin for &#160;

the six months ended June &#160;

30,2023 was 3.17% compared to &#160;

previous &#160;

year, &#160;

as

at December &#160;

The deposits 

increase of $2.8 &#160;

billion was mainly in &#160;

public sector and commercial accounts &#160;

at BPPR coupled with &#160;

an increase in time &#160;

deposits at 

PB &#160;

gathered &#160;

through &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, Puerto &#160;

Rico public &#160;

sector deposits &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$18.5 billion. &#160;

The rate &#160;

at which &#160;

public deposit 

balances &#160;

may &#160;

change &#160;

is &#160;

uncertain &#160;

and &#160;

difficult &#160;

to &#160;

predict. &#160;

The &#160;

receipt &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Government &#160;

of &#160;

additional &#160;

hurricane 

recovery related Federal assistance and seasonal tax collections, could increase &#160;

public deposit balances at BPPR in the near &#160;

term. 

The amount and timing of any reduction is likely &#160;

to be impacted by, for example, the speed at which federal assistance &#160;

is distributed, 

the financial &#160;

condition, liquidity &#160;

and cash &#160;

management practices &#160;

of the &#160;

mandated &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Fiscal 

Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (the &#160;

&#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;). &#160;

As of June 30, 2023, approximately 29% of the Corporation&#8217;s deposits are &#160;

public fund deposits from the Government of Puerto Rico, 

municipalities &#160;

and &#160;

government &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and &#160;

corporations. &#160;

These &#160;

deposits &#160;

are &#160;

indexed &#160;

to &#160;

short-term &#160;

market &#160;

rates &#160;

and 

fluctuate &#160;

in &#160;

cost &#160;

with &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

those &#160;

rates &#160;

with &#160;

a &#160;

one-quarter &#160;

lag, &#160;

in &#160;

accordance &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

terms. &#160;

As &#160;

a &#160;

result, &#160;

these 

deposits&#8217; costs &#160;

have generally &#160;

lagged variable &#160;

asset repricing. &#160;

Generally, &#160;

these deposits &#160;

require that &#160;

the bank &#160;

pledge high &#160;

credit 

quality securities &#160;

as collateral; therefore, &#160;

liquidity risks &#160;

arising from public &#160;

sector deposit &#160;

outflows are lower. &#160;

REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB &#160;

are subject to regulatory capital &#160;

requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. &#160;

The risk-

based &#160;

capital &#160;

standards &#160;

applicable &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

PB &#160;

(&#8220;Basel &#160;

III &#160;

capital &#160;

rules&#8221;) &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

final &#160;

capital 

framework for strengthening international capital standards, known &#160;

as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. &#160;

As 

of June 30, &#160;

2023, the Corporation&#8217;s, BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

and PB&#8217;s capital &#160;

ratios continue to &#160;

exceed the minimum requirements &#160;

for being &#8220;well-

the &#160;

continue to &#160;

regulatory capital &#160;

rules effective &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2020. &#160;

The &#160;

period provision delays for two &#160;

years the estimated impact &#160;

initial &#160;

two-year &#160;

delay. &#160;

As &#160;

of &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the 

Corporation had phased-in 50% of &#160;

the cumulative CECL deferral with &#160;

the remaining impact to &#160;

be recognized over the &#160;

remainder of 

the three-year transition period. 

On April 9, &#160;

2020, federal banking regulators &#160;

issued an interim final &#160;

rule to modify &#160;

the Basel III &#160;

regulatory capital rules applicable &#160;

to 

banking organizations to allow &#160;

those organizations participating in &#160;

the Paycheck Protection Program &#160;

(&#8220;PPP&#8221;) established under the 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief &#160;

and Economic Security &#160;

Act (the &#160;

&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) to &#160;

neutralize the regulatory &#160;

capital effects &#160;

of participating in 

the &#160;

program. &#160;

Specifically, &#160;

the &#160;

agencies &#160;

have &#160;

clarified &#160;

that &#160;

banking &#160;

organizations, &#160;

including &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

Bank 

subsidiaries, are permitted to &#160;

assign a zero &#160;

percent risk weight to &#160;

PPP loans for &#160;

purposes of determining risk-weighted assets &#160;

and 

risk-based &#160;

capital &#160;

ratios. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

in &#160;

order &#160;

to &#160;

facilitate &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Paycheck &#160;

Protection &#160;

Program &#160;

Liquidity &#160;

Facility &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;PPPL 

Facility&#8221;), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation&#8217;s Bank subsidiaries to 

fund PPP loans, the &#160;

agencies further clarified that, &#160;

for purposes of determining &#160;

leverage ratios, a banking &#160;

organization is permitted 

to exclude from &#160;

total average assets PPP &#160;

loans that have &#160;

been pledged as collateral &#160;

for a PPPL &#160;

Facility. As &#160;

of June 30, &#160;

2023, the 

Corporation has $12 million in PPP loans and no &#160;

loans were pledge as collateral for PPPL Facilities. 

The increase in the common equity Tier &#160;

I capital ratio, Tier I &#160;

capital ratio, and total capital ratio as &#160;

of June 30, 2023 as compared to 

December 31, 2022 was mainly to the six months period &#160;

earnings. &#160;

The increase in leverage capital ratio was also mainly due to &#160;

the 

period earnings. 

Non-GAAP financial measures 

The tangible common &#160;

equity, tangible &#160;

common equity ratio, &#160;

tangible assets and &#160;

which are

in &#160;

the &#160;

table &#160;

that &#160;

non-GAAP &#160;

measures. &#160;

Management &#160;

and &#160;

many &#160;

stock &#160;

analysts &#160;

use &#160;

the &#160;

tangible &#160;

common 

equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in &#160;

conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the &#160;

capital 

adequacy of banking organizations with significant &#160;

amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, &#160;

typically stemming from the use of 

the &#160;

purchase &#160;

accounting &#160;

method &#160;

for &#160;

mergers &#160;

and &#160;

acquisitions. &#160;

tangible &#160;

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the &#160;

Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest &#160;

rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk &#160;

refers to the &#160;

risk of a &#160;

reduction in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital due &#160;

to changes in &#160;

the market valuation &#160;

of its assets &#160;

and/or 

liabilities. &#160;

Most of the assets &#160;

subject to market valuation risk &#160;

are debt securities classified as &#160;

available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 &#160;

and 7 to the 

Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements for &#160;

further information &#160;

on the &#160;

debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale &#160;

and &#160;

held-to-maturity portfolios. 

Debt securities &#160;

classified as &#160;

available-for-sale amounted &#160;

to $17.2 &#160;

billion as &#160;

of June &#160;

30, 2023. &#160;

Other assets &#160;

subject to &#160;

market risk 

include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $55 million, mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $121 million, and 

securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted &#160;

to $29 million, as of June 30, 2023. &#160;

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject &#160;

to various categories of interest rate risk, &#160;

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 

option risks. &#160;

In managing &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk, management may &#160;

alter the &#160;

mix of &#160;

floating and &#160;

fixed rate &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, change 

pricing &#160;

schedules, &#160;

adjust &#160;

maturities &#160;

through &#160;

sales &#160;

and &#160;

purchases &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

and &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

derivative &#160;

contracts, 

among other alternatives. &#160;

Interest &#160;

rate &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

an &#160;

active &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

encompasses &#160;

monitoring &#160;

loan &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

flows &#160;

complemented &#160;

by 

investment and funding &#160;

activities. Effective management of &#160;

interest rate risk begins &#160;

with understanding the dynamic &#160;

characteristics 

of assets and &#160;

liabilities and determining the &#160;

appropriate rate risk position &#160;

given line of &#160;

business forecasts, management objectives, 

market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest &#160;

Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 

Economic Value &#160;

of Equity &#160;

(&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The &#160;

three methodologies &#160;

complement each &#160;

other and &#160;

are used &#160;

jointly in &#160;

the evaluation &#160;

of the 

Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII &#160;

simulation modeling is &#160;

prepared for a &#160;

five-year period, which &#160;

in conjunction with &#160;

the EVE analysis, &#160;

provides 

management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest &#160;

income simulation analysis &#160;

performed by legal &#160;

entity and on &#160;

a consolidated basis &#160;

is a &#160;

tool used &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation in 

estimating the &#160;

potential change &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

resulting from &#160;

hypothetical changes &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates. Sensitivity &#160;

analysis is 

calculated using a simulation model which incorporates &#160;

actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity &#160;

and interest yields or costs. &#160;

Management assesses &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk by &#160;

comparing various &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

under different &#160;

interest rate &#160;

scenarios that &#160;

differ in 

direction of interest &#160;

rate changes, the &#160;

degree of change &#160;

and the projected &#160;

shape of the &#160;

yield curve. For &#160;

example, the types &#160;

of rate 

scenarios processed during the &#160;

quarter include flat &#160;

rates, implied forwards, and &#160;

parallel and non-parallel rate &#160;

shocks. Management 

also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis &#160;

and prepayment risk exposures. &#160;

The asset &#160;

and liability &#160;

management group &#160;

performs validation &#160;

procedures on &#160;

various assumptions &#160;

used as &#160;

part of &#160;

the simulation 

analyses as well as validations &#160;

of results on a &#160;

monthly basis. In addition, the &#160;

model and processes used to &#160;

assess IRR are subject 

to independent validations according to the guidelines &#160;

established in the Model Governance and &#160;

Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII &#160;

simulations under interest rate &#160;

scenarios in which the &#160;

yield curve is assumed &#160;

to rise and &#160;

decline by 

the same &#160;

magnitude (parallel &#160;

shifts). The &#160;

rate scenarios &#160;

considered in &#160;

these market &#160;

risk simulations &#160;

reflect instantaneous &#160;

parallel 

changes &#160;

of &#160;

-100, &#160;

-200, &#160;

+100, &#160;

+200 &#160;

and &#160;

+400 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

during the &#160;

succeeding &#160;

twelve-month period. &#160;

Simulation &#160;

analyses &#160;

are 

based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points &#160;

and indexes, interest rate 

spreads, loan prepayments &#160;

and deposit elasticity. &#160;

Thus, they should &#160;

not be &#160;

relied upon as &#160;

indicative of actual &#160;

results. Further, &#160;

the 

estimates &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

contemplate &#160;

actions &#160;

that &#160;

management &#160;

could &#160;

take &#160;

to &#160;

respond &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the 

Corporation is also subject to &#160;

basis risk in the &#160;

repricing of its assets and &#160;

liabilities, including the basis related &#160;

to using different rate 

indexes for &#160;

the repricing &#160;

of assets and &#160;

liabilities, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the effect &#160;

of pricing &#160;

lags which &#160;

may be &#160;

contractual or &#160;

due to &#160;

historical 

differences &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

management &#160;

responses &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

rate &#160;

environment. &#160;

By &#160;

their &#160;

nature, &#160;

these &#160;

forward-looking 

computations are only &#160;

estimates and may &#160;

be different from &#160;

what may actually &#160;

occur in the &#160;

future. The following &#160;

table presents the 

results of the simulations at June 30, &#160;

2023 and December 31, 2022, assuming a static &#160;

As &#160;

of &#160;

June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

show the &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

a relatively &#160;

neutral sensitivity &#160;

position as &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

slightly 

liability sensitive position as of December 31, 2022. The primary reasons for the variation in sensitivity are changes in balance sheet 

composition driven by an increase in &#160;

overnight Fed Funds on the asset &#160;

side and higher in Puerto &#160;

Rico public sector deposits which 

are indexed &#160;

to market &#160;

rates. These &#160;

results suggest &#160;

that changes &#160;

in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s net &#160;

interest income &#160;

are driven &#160;

primarily by 

portfolio management strategies, &#160;

variations in &#160;

balance sheet mix &#160;

and changes in &#160;

liability costs, &#160;

primarily Puerto Rico &#160;

public sector 

deposits that represented $18.5 billion or 29% of deposits as of June 30, 2023. In declining rate scenarios net interest income would 

increase as &#160;

the decline &#160;

in the &#160;

cost &#160;

of these &#160;

deposits generates &#160;

a greater &#160;

benefit than &#160;

the changes &#160;

in asset &#160;

yields. In &#160;

rising rate 

scenarios &#160;

Popular&#8217;s &#160;

sensitivity &#160;

profile &#160;

is &#160;

also &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

its &#160;

large &#160;

proportion &#160;

of &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

public &#160;

sector &#160;

deposits &#160;

which &#160;

are 

indexed to &#160;

market rates. &#160;

As short-term &#160;

rates have &#160;

risen, the &#160;

cost of &#160;

these deposits &#160;

now increases &#160;

in sync &#160;

with market &#160;

rates and 

therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in rising &#160;

rate environments. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan and &#160;

investment portfolios &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

prepayment risk, &#160;

which results &#160;

from the &#160;

ability of &#160;

a third-party &#160;

to 

repay debt &#160;

obligations prior &#160;

to maturity. &#160;

Prepayment risk &#160;

also could &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on the &#160;

duration of &#160;

mortgage-backed 

securities &#160;

and &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

since &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

shorten &#160;

(or &#160;

lower &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

extend) &#160;

weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

engages in &#160;

trading activities &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

at its &#160;

subsidiaries, BPPR &#160;

and Popular &#160;

Securities. 

Popular Securities&#8217; &#160;

trading activities &#160;

consist primarily &#160;

of market-making &#160;

activities to &#160;

meet expected &#160;

customers&#8217; needs &#160;

related to &#160;

its 

retail brokerage business, &#160;

and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and &#160;

government sponsored securities with the objective of 

realizing gains &#160;

from expected &#160;

short-term price &#160;

movements. BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

trading activities consist &#160;

primarily of &#160;

holding U.S. &#160;

Government 

sponsored &#160;

mortgage-backed securities &#160;

classified &#160;

as &#160;

&#8220;trading&#8221; and &#160;

is &#160;

to &#160;

derive &#160;

spread &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

to &#160;

benefit &#160;

from &#160;

short-term &#160;

market 

movements. In &#160;

addition, BPPR &#160;

uses forward &#160;

contracts or &#160;

TBAs to &#160;

hedge its &#160;

securitization pipeline. &#160;

Risks related &#160;

to variations &#160;

in 

interest rates &#160;

and market volatility &#160;

are hedged &#160;

with TBAs &#160;

that have &#160;

characteristics similar to &#160;

that of &#160;

the forecasted security &#160;

and its 

conversion timeline. 

At June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation held &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are &#160;

limited by internal policies. For each &#160;

of the two subsidiaries, the &#160;

market risk assumed under 

trading &#160;

activities &#160;

is &#160;

measured &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

5-day &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

in &#160;

June &#160;

2023. &#160;

There &#160;

are 

numerous assumptions &#160;

and estimates &#160;

associated with &#160;

VAR &#160;

modeling, and &#160;

actual results &#160;

could differ &#160;

from these &#160;

assumptions and 

estimates. Backtesting is &#160;

performed to compare &#160;

actual results &#160;

against maximum estimated &#160;

losses, in order &#160;

to evaluate &#160;

model and 

assumptions accuracy. &#160;

In the opinion of management, the size and composition &#160;

of the trading portfolio does not represent &#160;

a significant source of market risk 

for the Corporation. 

Liquidity &#160;

The objective &#160;

of effective &#160;

liquidity management &#160;

is to &#160;

ensure that &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has sufficient &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

meet all &#160;

of its &#160;

financial 

obligations, finance &#160;

expected future &#160;

growth, &#160;

planned capital &#160;

distributions and &#160;

maintain a &#160;

reasonable safety &#160;

margin for &#160;

cash 

needs under &#160;

both normal &#160;

and stressed market &#160;

conditions. The Board &#160;

of Directors &#160;

is responsible &#160;

for establishing the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tolerance for liquidity risk, &#160;

including approving relevant risk limits and &#160;

policies. The Board of &#160;

other reasons &#160;

exogenous events &#160;

such as &#160;

the COVID-19

or some &#160;

other event &#160;

that causes &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

avoid exposure &#160;

to the &#160;

institution. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the &#160;

economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets, perceptions of 

the financial services industry and regulatory changes, &#160;

could also affect its ability to obtain funding. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

has adopted &#160;

policies and &#160;

limits to &#160;

monitor the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position and &#160;

that of &#160;

its banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, contingency funding &#160;

plans are used to &#160;

model various stress events &#160;

of different magnitudes and &#160;

affecting different time 

horizons that assist &#160;

management in evaluating &#160;

the size of &#160;

the liquidity buffers &#160;

needed if those &#160;

stress events &#160;

occur. However, &#160;

such

may &#160;

not &#160;

predict &#160;

accurately &#160;

information &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

borrowing &#160;

facilities 

available through its banking subsidiaries. &#160;

The principal &#160;

uses of &#160;

funds for &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries include &#160;

loan originations, &#160;

investment portfolio &#160;

purchases, loan &#160;

purchases 

and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 

expenses. Also, the &#160;

banking subsidiaries assume liquidity &#160;

risk related to collateral &#160;

posting requirements for certain &#160;

activities mainly 

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

commitments, &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions, &#160;

servicing &#160;

advances, &#160;

derivatives &#160;

and &#160;

credit &#160;

agreements. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries maintain &#160;

sufficient funding &#160;

capacity to &#160;

address large &#160;

increases in &#160;

funding requirements &#160;

such as &#160;

deposit 

outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

established &#160;

liquidity &#160;

guidelines &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to 

cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete &#160;

successfully in the marketplace for &#160;

deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 

factors, including pricing, service, convenience &#160;

and financial stability as &#160;

reflected by operating results and &#160;

financial condition, credit 

ratings (by &#160;

nationally recognized credit &#160;

rating agencies), customer &#160;

confidence, and &#160;

importantly, &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance coverage. 

Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured &#160;

(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 

the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 

Deposits are &#160;

a key &#160;

source of &#160;

funding. Refer &#160;

to Table &#160;

8 for &#160;

a breakdown &#160;

of deposits &#160;

by major &#160;

types. Core &#160;

deposits are &#160;

generated 

from a large base of consumer, &#160;

corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include certificate of &#160;

deposit under $250,000, 

all &#160;

interest-bearing &#160;

transactional &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts, &#160;

non-interest &#160;

bearing &#160;

deposits, &#160;

and &#160;

savings &#160;

deposits. &#160;

Core &#160;

deposits &#160;

exclude 

brokered deposits and certificate of &#160;

deposits over $250,000. &#160;

Core deposits, &#160;

excluding P.R. &#160;

public funds that are &#160;

fully collateralized, 

have &#160;

historically &#160;

provided &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation with &#160;

a &#160;

sizable &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

relatively stable &#160;

and &#160;

low-cost funds. &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public funds, &#160;

while 

linked to &#160;

market interest &#160;

rates, provide &#160;

a stable &#160;

source of &#160;

funding with &#160;

an attractive &#160;

earnings spread. &#160;

Core deposits &#160;

totaled $59.5 

billion, or &#160;

93% of &#160;

total deposits, &#160;

at June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

compared with &#160;

$57.6 billion, &#160;

or 94% &#160;

of total &#160;

deposits, at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022. 

Core deposits financed 88% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning &#160;

assets at June 30, 2023, compared with 90% &#160;

at December 31, 2022. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

$1.5 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

brokered &#160;

deposits &#160;

at &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

which &#160;

financed &#160;

approximately &#160;

2% &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

total &#160;

assets 

(December 31, 2022 - &#160;

$1.1 billion and 2%, &#160;

respectively). &#160;

In the event that &#160;

any of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory 

capital &#160;

ratios fall &#160;

below those &#160;

required by &#160;

a well-capitalized &#160;

institution or &#160;

are subject &#160;

to capital &#160;

restrictions by &#160;

the regulators, &#160;

that 

banking subsidiary faces &#160;

the risk of &#160;

not being able &#160;

to raise or &#160;

maintain brokered deposits &#160;

and faces limitations &#160;

on the rate &#160;

paid on 

deposits, which &#160;

may hinder &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to &#160;

effectively compete &#160;

in its &#160;

retail markets &#160;

and could &#160;

affect its &#160;

deposit raising 

efforts. &#160;

Deposits from the public &#160;

sector represent &#160;

an important source of funds &#160;

for the Corporation. As &#160;

of June 30, 2023, total &#160;

public sector 

deposits were $18.5 billion, &#160;

compared to $15.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Generally, these deposits require that the bank pledge 

high credit quality securities as collateral; &#160;

therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the 

bank receives its &#160;

collateral in return. &#160;

This, now unpledged, &#160;

collateral can either &#160;

be financed via &#160;

repurchase agreements or &#160;

sold for 

cash. &#160;

However, &#160;

there &#160;

are &#160;

some &#160;

timing &#160;

differences &#160;

between &#160;

the time &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

outflow occurs &#160;

and &#160;

when the &#160;

bank receives &#160;

its 

collateral. Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation mainly &#160;

utilizes fixed-rate U.S. &#160;

Treasury debt &#160;

securities as collateral. &#160;

While these securities 

have limited credit risk, they are subject to market &#160;

value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment. &#160;

When interest rates 

increase, the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the Corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the 

same &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

liabilities. &#160;

This &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

could &#160;

reduce &#160;

unpledged &#160;

securities &#160;

otherwise &#160;

available &#160;

as &#160;

liquidity 

sources to the Corporation. &#160;

At June 30, 2023, &#160;

management believes that the banking subsidiaries &#160;

had sufficient current and projected &#160;

liquidity sources to meet 

their &#160;

anticipated &#160;

cash &#160;

flow &#160;

obligations, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

special &#160;

needs &#160;

and &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

commitments, &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

ordinary &#160;

course &#160;

of 

business and have sufficient &#160;

liquidity resources to address a &#160;

stress event. Although the &#160;

banking subsidiaries have historically been 

able to replace &#160;

maturing deposits and advances, &#160;

no assurance can &#160;

be given that &#160;

they would be &#160;

able to replace &#160;

those funds in &#160;

the 

future if the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s financial condition &#160;

or general market &#160;

conditions were to &#160;

deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

financial flexibility 

will &#160;

be &#160;

severely constrained &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

banking subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

unable to &#160;

maintain access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

adequate financing &#160;

is &#160;

not 

available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The &#160;

banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit 

cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase &#160;

agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities. To 

the extent that &#160;

the value of securities &#160;

previously pledged as collateral &#160;

declines because of market &#160;

changes, the Corporation will &#160;

be 

required to &#160;

deposit additional cash &#160;

or securities to &#160;

meet its &#160;

margin requirements, thereby &#160;

adversely affecting its &#160;

liquidity. Finally, &#160;

if 

management &#160;

is &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

rely &#160;

more &#160;

heavily &#160;

on &#160;

more &#160;

expensive &#160;

funding &#160;

sources &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

future &#160;

growth, &#160;

revenues &#160;

may &#160;

not 

increase proportionately to cover costs. In this &#160;

case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

The Corporation &#160;

monitors uninsured &#160;

deposits under &#160;

applicable FDIC &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

monitors accounts 

with balances over $250,000. &#160;

While the Corporation has a &#160;

diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, &#160;

corporate and government 

clients, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

wholesale funding &#160;

sources such &#160;

as &#160;

Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries 

are subject to various regulatory limits &#160;

and authorization requirements that are further described &#160;

below and that may limit the &#160;

ability 

of those subsidiaries to act as a source of &#160;

funding to the BHCs.

The Corporation&#8217;s 6.125% unsecured senior debt securities mature in September of 2023. As of June 30, 2023, the BHCs had cash 

and money &#160;

markets investments &#160;

totaling $657 &#160;

million and &#160;

borrowing potential &#160;

of $211 &#160;

million from &#160;

its secured &#160;

facility with &#160;

BPPR. 

The BHCs&#8217; &#160;

liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash &#160;

on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity which 

are expected to be enough to meet all interest payments and &#160;

dividend obligations during the foreseeable future. On &#160;

March 13, 2023, 

the Corporation &#160;

issued $400 &#160;

million aggregate &#160;

principal amount &#160;

of 7.25% &#160;

Senior Notes &#160;

due 2028 &#160;

(the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) &#160;

in an &#160;

underwritten 

public offering. The Corporation will use a portion of the &#160;

net proceeds of the 2028 Notes offering to redeem, &#160;

on August 14, 2023 the 

outstanding &#160;

$300 &#160;

million &#160;

aggregate &#160;

principal &#160;

amount &#160;

its &#160;

outstanding &#160;

6.125% &#160;

Senior &#160;

Notes &#160;

due &#160;

September &#160;

2023. &#160;

For &#160;

the 

remainder of &#160;

year 2023, &#160;

debt service &#160;

at &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

is approximately &#160;

$24 million, &#160;

including $2 &#160;

million from &#160;

the 6.125% &#160;

unsecured 

senior &#160;

debt &#160;

which &#160;

will &#160;

be &#160;

redeemed on &#160;

August &#160;

14, &#160;

2023. Additionally, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

latest &#160;

quarterly dividend &#160;

was &#160;

$0.55 &#160;

per 

share or approximately $40 million per quarter. 

The BHCs have in &#160;

the past borrowed in the &#160;

corporate debt market primarily to finance &#160;

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 

debt obligations. These &#160;

sources of funding &#160;

are more costly &#160;

due to the &#160;

fact that two &#160;

out of the &#160;

three principal credit &#160;

rating agencies 

rate the Corporation below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which &#160;

affects the Corporation&#8217;s cost and &#160;

ability to raise funds in &#160;

the capital markets. 

Factors that the Corporation &#160;

does not control, such &#160;

as the economic outlook, &#160;

interest rate volatility, &#160;

inflation, disruptions in the &#160;

debt 

market, among others, &#160;

could also affect &#160;

its ability to &#160;

obtain funding. The &#160;

Corporation has an &#160;

automatic shelf registration &#160;

statement 

filed and effective &#160;

with the Securities and Exchange &#160;

Commission, which permits the Corporation &#160;

to issue an &#160;

unspecified amount of 

debt or equity securities. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

include &#160;

internally &#160;

generated &#160;

cash &#160;

flows &#160;

from &#160;

operations, &#160;

loan 

sales, repurchase agreements, capital &#160;

injections and borrowed funds &#160;

from their direct &#160;

parent companies or the &#160;

holding companies. 

The principal uses of funds for the non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, &#160;

operational expenses and payment 

of dividends to the &#160;

BHCs. The liquidity needs &#160;

of the non-banking subsidiaries &#160;

are minimal since most &#160;

of them are &#160;

funded internally 

from &#160;

operating cash &#160;

flows &#160;

or from &#160;

intercompany borrowings &#160;

or capital &#160;

contributions from &#160;

their holding &#160;

companies. During &#160;

the six 

months ended June 30, 2023, Popular, Inc. made capital contributions of $1.3 million to its wholly owned subsidiary, &#160;

Popular Impact 

Fund. &#160;

Dividends 

During &#160;

the &#160;

six &#160;

months &#160;

ended June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation declared &#160;

cash &#160;

dividends of &#160;

$1.10 &#160;

per &#160;

common &#160;

share &#160;

outstanding 

($79.2 million in &#160;

the aggregate). The &#160;

dividends for the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s Series A &#160;

preferred stock amounted to &#160;

$0.7 million. During &#160;

the 

six months ended June 30, 2023, the BHCs received dividends amounting to $100 million from BPPR, $50 million from PNA and &#160;

$4 

million from &#160;

its non-banking subsidiaries. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

during the &#160;

six months ended &#160;

2023, Popular International &#160;

Bank Inc., 

wholly &#160;

the &#160;

debt securities &#160;

portfolio provides &#160;

an 

additional &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

which &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

realized &#160;

through &#160;

either &#160;

securities &#160;

sales, &#160;

collateralized &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

that &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

repo &#160;

markets. &#160;

The 

availability &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

repurchase &#160;

agreement &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

having &#160;

sufficient &#160;

unpledged &#160;

collateral &#160;

available &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the 

transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s 

unpledged debt securities amounted to $ 5.0 billion &#160;

at June 30, 2023 and $ 7.8 billion at December &#160;

31, 2022. A substantial portion of 

these &#160;

debt &#160;

securities &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

raise &#160;

financing &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

money &#160;

markets &#160;

or &#160;

from &#160;

secured &#160;

lending &#160;

sources, &#160;

subject &#160;

to 

changes in their fair market value and customary adjustments &#160;

(haircuts). &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Additional liquidity may &#160;

be provided through &#160;

loan maturities, prepayments &#160;

and sales. The &#160;

loan portfolio can &#160;

also be used &#160;

to obtain 

funding in the capital markets. In particular, &#160;

mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have &#160;

secondary markets which the 

Corporation could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments 

In the ordinary course &#160;

of business, the Corporation &#160;

engages in financial transactions that &#160;

are not recorded on &#160;

the balance sheet or 

may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 

provider of &#160;

financial services, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

routinely enters &#160;

into commitments &#160;

with off-balance &#160;

sheet risk &#160;

to meet &#160;

the financial 

needs of &#160;

its customers. These &#160;

commitments may include &#160;

loan commitments and &#160;

standby letters of &#160;

credit. These commitments &#160;

are 

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

credit &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

used &#160;

for &#160;

on-balance &#160;

instruments. &#160;

These &#160;

instruments &#160;

involve, &#160;

to 

varying degrees, elements &#160;

of credit and &#160;

interest rate risk &#160;

in excess of &#160;

the amount recognized &#160;

in the statement &#160;

FDIC Special Assessments &#160;

On &#160;

May &#160;

11, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Deposit &#160;

Insurance &#160;

Corporation &#160;

(&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) &#160;

released &#160;

a &#160;

proposed &#160;

rule &#160;

that &#160;

would &#160;

impose &#160;

special 

assessments &#160;

to &#160;

recover &#160;

the &#160;

losses &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

insurance &#160;

fund &#160;

(&#8220;DIF&#8221;) &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC&#8217;s &#160;

use, &#160;

in &#160;

March &#160;

2023, &#160;

of &#160;

the 

systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under &#160;

the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in connection with the receiverships 

of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. &#160;

The &#160;

FDIC &#160;

stated &#160;

that &#160;

it &#160;

currently &#160;

estimates &#160;

those &#160;

assessed &#160;

losses &#160;

to &#160;

total &#160;

$15.8 &#160;

billion &#160;

and &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

special 

assessments would be adjusted as the loss &#160;

estimate changes. Under the proposed rule, the assessment base would &#160;

be an insured 

depository institution&#8217;s (&#8220;IDI&#8221;) &#160;

estimated uninsured deposits, as &#160;

reported in the &#160;

IDI&#8217;s December 31, &#160;

2022 Call Report, &#160;

excluding the 

first &#160;

$5 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

estimated &#160;

uninsured &#160;

deposits. &#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

holding &#160;

company &#160;

that &#160;

has &#160;

more &#160;

than &#160;

one &#160;

IDI &#160;

subsidiary, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the 

Corporation, the $5 billion exclusion would be &#160;

allocated among the company&#8217;s IDI subsidiaries &#160;

in proportion to each IDI&#8217;s &#160;

estimated 

uninsured deposits. The special assessments would be collected at &#160;

an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points per year (3.13 

basis points per quarter) over eight quarters in 2024 and 2025, with the first assessment period beginning January 1, 2024 (with &#160;

the 

first &#160;

assessment &#160;

payment &#160;

due &#160;

by &#160;

June &#160;

28, &#160;

2024). &#160;

Under &#160;

the &#160;

proposed &#160;

rule, &#160;

the &#160;

estimated &#160;

loss &#160;

pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

systemic &#160;

risk 

determination &#160;

would be &#160;

periodically adjusted, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC &#160;

would retain &#160;

the &#160;

ability to &#160;

cease &#160;

collection &#160;

early, &#160;

extend the &#160;

special 

assessment collection period and impose &#160;

a final shortfall special assessment &#160;

on a one-time basis. In &#160;

their December 31, 2022 &#160;

Call 

Reports, BPPR and PB reported estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $28.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. &#160;

Although 

the proposal could be changed, the assessments, as proposed, would &#160;

be recorded as an expense in the period in which this &#160;

change 

is enacted. &#160;

Such expense &#160;

would significantly affect &#160;

noninterest expense and &#160;

the results &#160;

of operations for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

in which &#160;

it is 

recognized. If the &#160;

final rule is &#160;

adopted as proposed, &#160;

the special assessment &#160;

for the &#160;

Corporation is estimated &#160;

at approximately $66 

million. The actual assessment may vary as a result &#160;

of the final rule, including any changes to the calculation &#160;

methodology.

Risks to Liquidity &#160;

Total lines of credit outstanding, or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily &#160;

a measure of the total credit 

available &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

continuing &#160;

basis. &#160;

Some &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

lines &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements, &#160;

changes &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

the 

&#160;

collateral, standards of &#160;

creditworthiness, leverage ratios &#160;

and other regulatory &#160;

requirements, among other factors. &#160;

Derivatives, such 

as &#160;

those &#160;

embedded &#160;

in &#160;

long-term &#160;

repurchase &#160;

transactions &#160;

or &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

swaps, &#160;

and &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

exposures, &#160;

such &#160;

as 

recourse, performance bonds &#160;

or credit card &#160;

arrangements, are subject &#160;

to collateral requirements. &#160;

As their fair &#160;

value increases, the 

collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing &#160;

the balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

market for the &#160;

Corporation is an &#160;

additional risk factor &#160;

that could affect &#160;

its financing activities. &#160;

In 

the case &#160;

of a &#160;

deterioration in economic &#160;

and fiscal conditions &#160;

in Puerto Rico, &#160;

the credit quality &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation could be &#160;

affected 

and result &#160;

in higher &#160;

credit costs. &#160;

Refer to &#160;

the Geographic &#160;

and Government &#160;

Risk section &#160;

of this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

some highlights &#160;

on the 

current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing &#160;

fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic &#160;

outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory 

changes, &#160;

could also &#160;

affect &#160;

its &#160;

ability to &#160;

obtain funding. &#160;

In &#160;

order to &#160;

prepare for &#160;

the &#160;

possibility of &#160;

such scenario, &#160;

management &#160;

has 

adopted &#160;

contingency &#160;

plans &#160;

for &#160;

raising &#160;

financing &#160;

under &#160;

stress &#160;

scenarios &#160;

when &#160;

important &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funds &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

usually &#160;

fully 

available &#160;

are &#160;

temporarily &#160;

unavailable. These &#160;

plans call &#160;

for &#160;

using &#160;

alternate &#160;

funding &#160;

mechanisms, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

pledging &#160;

of &#160;

certain 

asset classes &#160;

and accessing &#160;

secured credit &#160;

lines and &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

put in &#160;

place with &#160;

the FHLB &#160;

and the &#160;

FRB. The &#160;

Corporation is 

subject to &#160;

positive tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements to &#160;

utilize secured &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

with the &#160;

FHLB that &#160;

could &#160;

result in &#160;

a limitation &#160;

of 

borrowing amounts or maturity terms, even if the Corporation &#160;

exceeds well-capitalized regulatory capital levels. &#160;

The credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

Popular&#8217;s debt &#160;

obligations are &#160;

a relevant &#160;

factor for &#160;

liquidity because &#160;

they impact &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to 

borrow &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets, &#160;

its &#160;

cost &#160;

and &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

sources. &#160;

Credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

strength, &#160;

credit 

quality and &#160;

concentrations in &#160;

the loan &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

level and &#160;

volatility of &#160;

earnings, capital &#160;

adequacy, &#160;

the quality &#160;

of management, 

geographic concentration &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico, the &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet, the &#160;

availability of &#160;

a significant &#160;

base of &#160;

core retail &#160;

and 

commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access &#160;

a broad array of wholesale funding sources, &#160;

among other factors. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

various &#160;

statutory &#160;

provisions &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

dividends &#160;

an &#160;

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

pay &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

holding 

company without &#160;

regulatory approval. A &#160;

member bank must &#160;

obtain the &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

for any &#160;

dividend, if 

the total &#160;

of all &#160;

dividends declared &#160;

by the &#160;

member bank &#160;

during the &#160;

calendar year &#160;

would exceed &#160;

the total &#160;

of its &#160;

net income &#160;

for that 

year, &#160;

combined with &#160;

its retained &#160;

net income &#160;

for the &#160;

preceding two &#160;

years, after &#160;

considering those &#160;

years&#8217; dividend &#160;

activity, &#160;

less any 

required transfers &#160;

to surplus &#160;

or to &#160;

a fund &#160;

for the &#160;

retirement of &#160;

any preferred &#160;

stock. &#160;

During &#160;

the six &#160;

months ended &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, 

BPPR &#160;

declared &#160;

cash &#160;

dividends &#160;

of &#160;

$100 &#160;

million. &#160;

At &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

can &#160;

declare &#160;

a &#160;

dividend &#160;

of &#160;

approximately &#160;

$335 &#160;

million 

without prior approval of the &#160;

Federal Reserve Board due to &#160;

its retained income, declared dividend activity and &#160;

transfers to statutory 

reserves over the measurement period. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its 

undivided &#160;

profits &#160;

as &#160;

reported &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

Report &#160;

of &#160;

Condition &#160;

and &#160;

Income, &#160;

unless &#160;

the &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

has &#160;

received &#160;

the &#160;

approval &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board. &#160;

A &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

also &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

permit &#160;

any &#160;

portion &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

permanent &#160;

capital &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

withdrawn &#160;

unless &#160;

the 

withdrawal &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

approved &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Reserve &#160;

Board. &#160;

Pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

these &#160;

requirements, &#160;

PB &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

declare &#160;

or &#160;

pay &#160;

a 

dividend without &#160;

the prior &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

and the &#160;

NYSDFS. The &#160;

ability of &#160;

a bank &#160;

subsidiary to &#160;

up-stream 

dividends to its BHC could &#160;

thus be impacted by &#160;

its financial performance and capital, including &#160;

tangible and regulatory capital, thus 

potentially limiting &#160;

the amount &#160;

of cash &#160;

moving up &#160;

to the &#160;

BHCs from &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries. This &#160;

could, in &#160;

turn, affect &#160;

the BHCs 

ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock, repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations, for 

example. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not &#160;

used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance &#160;

its operations, and 

therefore are less sensitive to the level and &#160;

changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

currently &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

issue &#160;

unsecured &#160;

senior &#160;

debt, &#160;

as &#160;

these &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

funded 

primarily with &#160;

deposits and &#160;

secured borrowings. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries had &#160;

$7.8 million &#160;

in deposits &#160;

at June &#160;

30, 2023 &#160;

that are 

subject to rating triggers. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

certain mortgage servicing &#160;

and custodial agreements &#160;

that BPPR &#160;

has with &#160;

third parties &#160;

include rating covenants. &#160;

In the 

event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 

escrow &#160;

deposits &#160;

and/or &#160;

increase &#160;

collateral &#160;

levels &#160;

securing &#160;

the &#160;

recourse &#160;

obligations. &#160;

Also, &#160;

as &#160;

discussed &#160;

in &#160;

Note &#160;

20 &#160;

to &#160;

the 

Consolidated &#160;

Financial &#160;

Statements, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

services &#160;

residential &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

credit &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions. 

Certain &#160;

contractual &#160;

agreements &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

collateral &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

such &#160;

recourse &#160;

obligations &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

institution&#8217;s 

required &#160;

credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

not &#160;

maintained. &#160;

Collateral &#160;

pledged &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

recourse &#160;

obligations &#160;

amounted &#160;

to 

approximately $26.2 million at June 30, 2023. The Corporation could be required to &#160;

post additional collateral under the agreements. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Management expects that it would be able to &#160;

meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post 

collateral under certain agreements or &#160;

the loss of escrow deposits &#160;

could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

resources and impact its 

operating results.

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A &#160;

significant portion &#160;

concentrated in &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

(&#8220;Puerto 

Rico&#8221;), which has faced severe economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the past and may face additional &#160;

challenges in the future. &#160;

Economic Performance. &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy suffered &#160;

a &#160;

severe and &#160;

prolonged recession &#160;

from &#160;

2007 &#160;

to &#160;

2017, &#160;

with real &#160;

gross national &#160;

product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) 

contracting approximately 15% &#160;

during this period. &#160;

In 2017, Hurricane &#160;

Mar&#237;a caused significant &#160;

damage and destruction &#160;

across the 

island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in &#160;

part aided by 

the large amount &#160;

of federal disaster &#160;

relief and recovery &#160;

assistance funds injected &#160;

into the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy in &#160;

connection with 

Hurricane Mar&#237;a &#160;

and other &#160;

recent natural &#160;

disasters. This &#160;

growth was &#160;

interrupted by &#160;

the economic &#160;

shock caused &#160;

by the &#160;

COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part &#160;

aided by additional federal assistance from &#160;

pandemic-related stimulus measures.

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

(the &#160;

reflected &#160;

a &#160;

The &#160;

Economic 

Activity Index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real GNP. In February 2023, the 

Puerto Rico &#160;

Planning Board &#160;

revised its &#160;

real GNP &#160;

forecast for &#160;

the current &#160;

fiscal year &#160;

(July 2022-June &#160;

2023) from &#160;

1.7% growth &#160;

to 

0.7% growth, citing an anticipated deacceleration in the &#160;

global economy. &#160;

While the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy has &#160;

not directly &#160;

tracked the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy in &#160;

recent years, &#160;

many of &#160;

the external &#160;

factors 

that impact &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

are affected &#160;

by the &#160;

policies and performance &#160;

of the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy. &#160;

These external 

factors include &#160;

the level &#160;

of interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

the rate &#160;

of inflation. &#160;

Inflation in &#160;

the United &#160;

States, as &#160;

measured by the &#160;

United States 

Consumer Price Index &#160;

(published by the &#160;

U.S. Bureau of &#160;

Labor Statistics), increased &#160;

3.0% during the &#160;

12-month period ended &#160;

June 

2023. &#160;

Inflation in Puerto Rico, &#160;

as measured by the &#160;

Puerto Rico Consumer Price &#160;

Index (published by the &#160;

Department of Labor and 

Human Resources of &#160;

Puerto Rico), increased &#160;

2.3% &#160;

during the 12-month &#160;

period ended June &#160;

2023. The rate &#160;

of inflation has &#160;

slowed 

down in &#160;

recent months, &#160;

following a &#160;

mid-2022 peak, &#160;

as the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

has implemented &#160;

a series &#160;

of benchmark &#160;

interest rate 

increases. The speed and scope of the inflation slowdown &#160;

will inform if and how much interest rates will &#160;

continue to increase, as well 

how these changes will impact the United States &#160;

and Puerto Rico economies. 

Fiscal Challenges. &#160;

As the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy contracted, the &#160;

government&#8217;s public &#160;

debt rose &#160;

rapidly, &#160;

in part &#160;

from borrowing to &#160;

cover deficits &#160;

to pay 

debt service, &#160;

pension benefits and &#160;

other government expenditures. &#160;

By 2016, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government had &#160;

over $120 &#160;

billion in 

combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had &#160;

lost access to the capital markets, and was in &#160;

the midst of a fiscal crisis. 

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

escalating fiscal &#160;

and economic &#160;

challenges &#160;

and imminent &#160;

widespread defaults &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

public debt &#160;

prompted the &#160;

U.S. 

Congress to &#160;

enact the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Oversight, Management, &#160;

and Economic &#160;

Stability Act &#160;

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in &#160;

June 2016. &#160;

PROMESA 

created the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; with ample powers over Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 

instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, &#160;

&#8220;PR Government Entities&#8221;). Pursuant &#160;

to PROMESA, the &#160;

Oversight Board will be &#160;

in 

place &#160;

until &#160;

market &#160;

access &#160;

is &#160;

restored &#160;

and &#160;

balanced &#160;

budgets &#160;

are &#160;

produced &#160;

for &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

four &#160;

consecutive &#160;

years. &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

also 

established two &#160;

mechanisms for &#160;

the restructuring &#160;

of the &#160;

obligations of &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities: (a) &#160;

Title III, &#160;

which provides &#160;

an in-

&#160;

&#160;

court process that incorporates many of the &#160;

powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &#160;

and permits adjustment of a broad 

range of obligations, and &#160;

(b) Title VI, &#160;

which provides for a &#160;

largely out-of-court process through which &#160;

modifications to financial debt 

can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors &#160;

and bind holdouts. 

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several &#160;

of its instrumentalities have availed themselves &#160;

of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 

III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 

including Government &#160;

Development Bank for &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico Sales &#160;

Tax &#160;

Financing Corporation, and &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico 

Highways &#160;

and &#160;

Transportation &#160;

Authority, &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

completed &#160;

debt &#160;

restructurings &#160;

under &#160;

Titles &#160;

III &#160;

or &#160;

VI &#160;

of &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

While &#160;

the 

majority &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debt &#160;

has &#160;

already &#160;

been &#160;

restructured, &#160;

some &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities &#160;

still &#160;

face &#160;

significant &#160;

fiscal &#160;

challenges. &#160;

For 

example, the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Electric Power &#160;

Authority is &#160;

still in &#160;

the process &#160;

of restructuring &#160;

its debts &#160;

under Title &#160;

III of &#160;

PROMESA and 

other PR Government &#160;

Entities, such as &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

Industrial Development Company, &#160;

have defaulted on &#160;

their bonds but &#160;

have 

not commenced debt restructuring proceedings under &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

Municipalities. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges have &#160;

also adversely impacted its municipalities. Budgetary subsidies to municipalities 

have &#160;

gradually &#160;

declined &#160;

in &#160;

recent &#160;

years &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

scheduled &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

ultimately &#160;

eliminated &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

year &#160;

2025 &#160;

as &#160;

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

fiscal 

measures &#160;

required &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board. &#160;

According &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

latest &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

fiscal &#160;

plan &#160;

certified &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board, 

municipalities &#160;

have &#160;

made &#160;

little &#160;

to &#160;

no &#160;

progress &#160;

towards &#160;

implementing &#160;

the &#160;

fiscal &#160;

discipline &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

reduce &#160;

reliance &#160;

on &#160;

these 

budgetary appropriations and this &#160;

lack of fiscal &#160;

management may threaten the &#160;

ability of certain &#160;

municipalities to provide &#160;

necessary 

services, such as health, sanitation, public safety &#160;

and emergency services to their residents, forcing them &#160;

to prioritize expenditures. 

Municipalities &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

and, &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board&#8217;s &#160;

request, &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

submit &#160;

fiscal &#160;

plans &#160;

and &#160;

annual 

budgets &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

for &#160;

its &#160;

review &#160;

and &#160;

approval. &#160;

They &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

required to &#160;

seek &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

approval &#160;

to &#160;

issue, 

guarantee &#160;

or &#160;

modify &#160;

their &#160;

debts &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

contracts &#160;

with an &#160;

aggregate &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

$10 &#160;

million &#160;

or &#160;

more. &#160;

With &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight 

Board&#8217;s approval, municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. To 

date, however, no municipality has been subject to any such debt &#160;

restructuring process. &#160;

Exposure of the Corporation &#160;

The credit &#160;

quality of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

reflects, among other &#160;

things, the &#160;

general economic conditions &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

other 

adverse conditions affecting Puerto &#160;

Rico consumers and businesses. &#160;

Deterioration in the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy has resulted &#160;

in the 

past, and could &#160;

result in the future, &#160;

in higher delinquencies, greater &#160;

charge-offs and increased losses, &#160;

which could materially affect 

our financial condition and results of operations. &#160;

At June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

to &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities totaled &#160;

$380 million, &#160;

of &#160;

which $351 &#160;

million were 

outstanding, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$374 million &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022, of &#160;

which $327 &#160;

million &#160;

were outstanding. &#160;

A &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

Puerto 

Rico&#8217;s fiscal and &#160;

economic situation could adversely &#160;

affect the value &#160;

of our Puerto &#160;

Rico government obligations, resulting &#160;

in losses 

to &#160;

us. &#160;

Of &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

outstanding, &#160;

$325 &#160;

million &#160;

consists &#160;

of &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

$26 &#160;

million &#160;

are &#160;

securities &#160;

($302 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

$25 &#160;

million, 

respectively, &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2022). &#160;

All of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

outstanding at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023 were &#160;

obligations from 

various &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

municipalities. &#160;

In &#160;

most &#160;

cases, &#160;

these &#160;

were &#160;

&#8220;general &#160;

obligations&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

municipality, &#160;

to &#160;

which &#160;

the &#160;

applicable 

municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged its &#160;

good &#160;

faith, credit &#160;

and unlimited &#160;

taxing power, &#160;

or &#160;

&#8220;special obligations&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to &#160;

which the 

applicable municipality has pledged basic property &#160;

tax or sales tax &#160;

revenues. At June 30, 2023, &#160;

74% of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure 

to &#160;

municipal &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

securities &#160;

was &#160;

concentrated &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

municipalities &#160;

of &#160;

San &#160;

Juan, &#160;

Guaynabo, &#160;

Carolina &#160;

and &#160;

Caguas. &#160;

For 

additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto &#160;

Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, 

refer to Note 21 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

at June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation had &#160;

$240 million &#160;

in loans &#160;

insured or &#160;

securities issued by &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

governmental 

entities, but for &#160;

which the principal source &#160;

of repayment is &#160;

non-governmental ($251 million at December 31, 2022). &#160;

These included 

$199 million in &#160;

residential mortgage loans insured &#160;

by the Puerto &#160;

Rico Housing Finance Authority &#160;

(&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a &#160;

PR Government Entity 

(December 31, 2022 - $209 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto &#160;

Rico residential properties and 

the &#160;

HFA &#160;

insurance &#160;

covers &#160;

losses &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

event &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

borrower &#160;

default &#160;

and &#160;

upon &#160;

the &#160;

satisfaction &#160;

of &#160;

certain &#160;

other &#160;

conditions. &#160;

The 

Corporation also had at June 30, 2023, $40 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto 

Rico residential properties, and for which &#160;

HFA also provides insurance &#160;

to cover losses in the &#160;

event of a borrower default, &#160;

and upon 

the satisfaction of certain &#160;

other conditions (December 31, 2022 &#160;

- $42 million). In &#160;

the event that the &#160;

mortgage loans insured by &#160;

HFA 

and &#160;

held &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation directly &#160;

or &#160;

those &#160;

serving &#160;

as &#160;

collateral for &#160;

the &#160;

HFA &#160;

bonds &#160;

default and &#160;

the &#160;

collateral &#160;

is &#160;

insufficient &#160;

to 

satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s &#160;

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

condition &#160;

of &#160;

HFA &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

such &#160;

obligations &#160;

become &#160;

due &#160;

and &#160;

payable. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

consider &#160;

the &#160;

government 

guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated &#160;

with this portfolio. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio also &#160;

includes loans &#160;

to &#160;

private borrowers &#160;

who &#160;

are service &#160;

providers, lessors, &#160;

suppliers or &#160;

have 

other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively &#160;

affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and &#160;

economic 

situation &#160;

of &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities. &#160;

Similarly, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

government 

employees &#160;

and &#160;

retirees, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

be &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

employee &#160;

layoffs &#160;

or &#160;

furloughs &#160;

or 

reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic &#160;

situation deteriorates. 

As of June &#160;

30, 2023, BPPR had &#160;

$18.5 billion in deposits from &#160;

the Puerto Rico government, its &#160;

instrumentalities, and municipalities. 

The &#160;

rate &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

public &#160;

deposit &#160;

balances &#160;

may &#160;

decline is &#160;

uncertain and &#160;

difficult &#160;

to &#160;

predict. &#160;

The &#160;

amount &#160;

and &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

any &#160;

such 

reduction is &#160;

likely to &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for example, &#160;

the speed &#160;

at which &#160;

federal assistance &#160;

is distributed &#160;

and the &#160;

financial condition, 

liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, &#160;

as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain &#160;

these customer relationships. 

The &#160;

Corporation may &#160;

also have &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure with &#160;

regards to &#160;

avoidance and &#160;

other causes &#160;

of &#160;

action initiated &#160;

by the &#160;

Oversight 

Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 21 

to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

has &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

USVI &#160;

government 

entities. 

The USVI has &#160;

been experiencing a &#160;

number of fiscal &#160;

and economic challenges, &#160;

which could adversely &#160;

affect the &#160;

ability of its &#160;

public 

corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding &#160;

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI &#160;

and, as such, 

there &#160;

is &#160;

currently &#160;

no &#160;

federal &#160;

To &#160;

the extent that &#160;

the fiscal condition &#160;

of the USVI &#160;

continues to deteriorate, the &#160;

U.S. Congress or the &#160;

Government of the &#160;

enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the &#160;

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a &#160;

stay on creditor 

remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable &#160;

to the USVI. 

At June &#160;

British Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(&#8220;BVI&#8221;), &#160;

which &#160;

was &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected by &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic, 

particularly as &#160;

a reduction &#160;

in the &#160;

tourism activity &#160;

which accounts &#160;

for a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of its &#160;

economy. &#160;

Although the &#160;

Corporation 

has no &#160;

significant exposure &#160;

to a &#160;

single borrower &#160;

in the &#160;

BVI, at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, it &#160;

has a &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

amounting to &#160;

approximately 

$207 million comprised of various retail and commercial &#160;

clients, compared to a loan portfolio of $214 million &#160;

at December 31, 2022. 

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes &#160;

6 and 7 to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s investment 

securities &#160;

represented exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Government in &#160;

the &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

agency 

mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.6 billion &#160;

of residential mortgages, $12 million of SBA loans under the 

Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and $71 million &#160;

commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by &#160;

the U.S. Government or its 

agencies at June 30, 2023 (compared to $1.6 &#160;

billion, $38 million and $72 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022).

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) &#160;

include primarily past-due &#160;

loans that &#160;

are no &#160;

longer accruing interest, &#160;

renegotiated loans, and &#160;

real 

estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit &#160;

quality metrics, is presented in Table 21. 

During the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023, the Corporation &#160;

continued to show &#160;

favorable credit quality &#160;

trends with &#160;

low levels of &#160;

NCOs and 

decreasing NPLs. &#160;

We continue &#160;

to closely &#160;

monitor changes &#160;

in the &#160;

macroeconomic environment &#160;

and borrower &#160;

performance, given 

inflationary &#160;

pressures and &#160;

geopolitical &#160;

risks. &#160;

However, &#160;

management believes &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

improvement over &#160;

recent years &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

risk 

profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios positions &#160;

Popular to operate successfully under the current environment. &#160;

Total &#160;

NPAs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$57 &#160;

million &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

Total &#160;

non-performing &#160;

loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio 

(&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$54 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$50 &#160;

million, &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

lower 

mortgage and &#160;

consumer NPLs &#160;

by $48 &#160;

million and &#160;

$16 million, &#160;

respectively, &#160;

in part &#160;

offset &#160;

by higher &#160;

construction and &#160;

commercial 

NPLs by &#160;

$9 million &#160;

and $7 &#160;

million, respectively. &#160;

The consumer &#160;

NPLs decrease &#160;

was mostly &#160;

driven by &#160;

a $11 &#160;

million line &#160;

of credit 

charge-off on a single relationship, while the construction and commercial NPLs increase &#160;

was driven by a $9 million and $14 million 

loan &#160;

relationship, &#160;

respectively. &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S. &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$4 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

lower 

mortgage NPLs. On June &#160;

30, 2023, the ratio &#160;

of NPLs to total &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio was 1.2% compared &#160;

to 1.4%, at December &#160;

31, 

2022. Other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) decreased by $3 million. On June 30, 2023, NPLs secured by real estate amounted 

to &#160;

$272 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

$27 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S, &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

$303 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

$33 &#160;

million, 

respectively, at December 31, 2022. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio secured &#160;

by real &#160;

estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$10.1 billion &#160;

at June &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

of which 

$3.0 billion was secured &#160;

with owner occupied properties, compared &#160;

with $9.9 billion and &#160;

$3.1 billion, respectively, &#160;

at December 31, 

2022. Office space &#160;

leasing exposure in &#160;

our non-owner occupied &#160;

CRE portfolio is &#160;

limited, representing only &#160;

1.8% or $600 &#160;

million of 

our total loan portfolio. &#160;

The exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with average &#160;

loan size of $2.0 million and is 

well diversified across tenant type. 

CRE NPLs amounted to $65 million at June 30, &#160;

2023, compared with $54 million at December &#160;

31, 2022. The CRE NPL ratios for the 

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S. &#160;

segments &#160;

were &#160;

1.27% &#160;

and &#160;

0.10%, &#160;

respectively, &#160;

at &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

1.04% &#160;

and &#160;

0.12%, 

respectively, at December 31, 2022. 

In &#160;

addition to &#160;

the NPLs &#160;

included in &#160;

Table &#160;

21, at &#160;

June 30, &#160;

2023, there &#160;

were $350 &#160;

million &#160;

of performing &#160;

loans, mostly &#160;

commercial 

loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2022 

- $374 million). 

For &#160;

the &#160;

period &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

total &#160;

of &#160;

NPLs &#160;

held-in-portfolio, &#160;

excluding &#160;

consumer &#160;

loans, &#160;

remained &#160;

flat, &#160;

when 

compared to the inflows for the same period in 2022. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment increased slightly by $2 

million, compared to the same period in 2022. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular U.S. segment decreased by $2 million 

from the same period in 2022.

[2] It is &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

policy to report &#160;

delinquent residential &#160;

mortgage loans &#160;

insured by FHA &#160;

or guaranteed by &#160;

the VA &#160;

as accruing loans &#160;

past due 

90 days or more as opposed to non-performing &#160;

since the principal repayment is insured. &#160;

These balances include $133 million of &#160;

residential mortgage 

loans &#160;

insured &#160;

by &#160;

FHA &#160;

or &#160;

guaranteed &#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, &#160;

2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), 

represents management&#8217;s estimate &#160;

of expected credit &#160;

losses through the &#160;

remaining contractual life &#160;

of the &#160;

different loan &#160;

segments, 

impacted by expected &#160;

prepayments. The ACL &#160;

is maintained at &#160;

a sufficient &#160;

level to provide &#160;

for estimated credit &#160;

losses on collateral 

dependent &#160;

loans &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

loans &#160;

modified &#160;

to &#160;

borrowers &#160;

with &#160;

financial &#160;

difficulty, &#160;

including &#160;

legacy &#160;

troubled &#160;

debt &#160;

restructurings, 

separately &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

remainder &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolio. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

management &#160;

evaluates &#160;

the &#160;

adequacy &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

on &#160;

a 

quarterly &#160;

basis. &#160;

In &#160;

this &#160;

evaluation, &#160;

management &#160;

considers &#160;

current &#160;

conditions, &#160;

macroeconomic &#160;

economic &#160;

expectations &#160;

through &#160;

a 

reasonable and supportable period, &#160;

historical loss experience, portfolio composition &#160;

by loan type &#160;

and risk characteristics, results &#160;

of 

periodic credit reviews &#160;

of individual loans, &#160;

and regulatory requirements, amongst &#160;

other factors. The &#160;

Corporation evaluates, at &#160;

least 

on an &#160;

annual basis, the &#160;

assumptions tied to &#160;

the CECL &#160;

accounting framework, including &#160;

the reasonable and &#160;

supportable period as 

well as the reversion window. &#160;

The Corporation must rely on &#160;

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where &#160;

the ultimate outcome is unknown, such &#160;

as 

economic developments affecting specific &#160;

customers, industries, or markets. &#160;

Other factors that can &#160;

affect management&#8217;s estimates 

are &#160;

recalibration &#160;

of &#160;

statistical &#160;

models &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

calculate &#160;

lifetime &#160;

expected &#160;

losses, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

financial 

accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, &#160;

among others. Changes in the financial condition &#160;

of individual borrowers, 

in economic &#160;

conditions, and &#160;

in the &#160;

condition of &#160;

the various &#160;

markets in &#160;

which collateral &#160;

may be &#160;

sold, may &#160;

also affect &#160;

the required 

level of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses. Consequently, &#160;

the business &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

capital, and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

could also be affected. 

Given that any one &#160;

economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the &#160;

Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate &#160;

its ACL. The 

baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest &#160;

probability, followed by the &#160;

pessimistic scenario. &#160;

During the second quarter 

2023, due to positive trends, the Corporation lowered the probability weights assigned to the pessimistic scenario and increased the 

probability weight assigned to the baseline scenario, prompting a reserve release of $5.8 million. The baseline scenario continues to 

be assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario, &#160;

and then the optimistic scenario. 

The &#160;

2023 &#160;

annualized &#160;

GDP &#160;

growth &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

baseline &#160;

scenario &#160;

Rico &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States, 

respectively, compared to 2.1% and 1.3% &#160;

in the previous quarter. The 2023 forecasted average unemployment rate for &#160;

Puerto Rico 

improved to &#160;

6.3% from &#160;

6.9% in &#160;

the previous &#160;

forecast, while &#160;

$700 &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

of &#160;

$20 &#160;

million, &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

with 

December 31, 2022. &#160;

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2022-02 in 

March 2022, which eliminates the &#160;

accounting guidance for troubled debt &#160;

restructures (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and the requirement &#160;

to measure the 

effect &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

concession from &#160;

a &#160;

loan &#160;

modification, for &#160;

which &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation used &#160;

a &#160;

discounted cash &#160;

flow &#160;

(&#8220;DCF&#8221;) &#160;

method. &#160;

This 

impact &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

release &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

of &#160;

approximately &#160;

$46 &#160;

million &#160;

presented &#160;

as &#160;

an &#160;

adjustment &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

beginning &#160;

balance &#160;

of 

retained earnings, net of tax effect. &#160;

Excluding ASU 2022-02 impact, the ACL for BPPR increased by $23 million, &#160;

when compared to December 31, 2022, while the ACL 

for &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S &#160;

increased &#160;

by &#160;

$3 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

These &#160;

increases &#160;

were &#160;

mostly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

specific &#160;

reserves &#160;

for 

collateral dependent U.S. commercial and P.R. &#160;

construction loans, changes in macroeconomic scenarios, &#160;

higher loan volumes and 

migration of &#160;

P.R. &#160;

consumer credit &#160;

scores, partially &#160;

offset by &#160;

changes in &#160;

the assignments &#160;

of probability &#160;

weights to &#160;

macroeconomic 

scenarios, as previously mentioned, and reductions in qualitative reserves. The Corporation&#8217;s ratio of the allowance for credit losses 

to loans held-in-portfolio was &#160;

2.12% on June &#160;

30, 2023, compared to &#160;

2.25% on December &#160;

31, 2022. &#160;

The ratio of &#160;

the allowance for 

credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 181.6%, &#160;

compared to 163.9% on December 31, 2022. 

The provision for credit losses for the period ended June &#160;

30, 2023, amounted to an expense of $36 million, compared &#160;

to an expense 

of &#160;

$10 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

period &#160;

ended &#160;

June &#160;

30, &#160;

2022, &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

prior &#160;

period &#160;

included &#160;

reductions &#160;

in &#160;

reserves &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

post-pandemic 

improvements in &#160;

the macroeconomic &#160;

outlook and &#160;

lower NCOs. &#160;

The provision &#160;

expense related to &#160;

the loans-held-in-portfolio for &#160;

the 

six-month period &#160;

ended June &#160;
