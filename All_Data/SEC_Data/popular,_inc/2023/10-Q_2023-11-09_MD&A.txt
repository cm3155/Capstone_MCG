Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#160;

&#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest earning &#160;

assets include &#160;

investment securities &#160;

and loans &#160;

that are &#160;

exempt from &#160;

income tax, &#160;

principally in 

Puerto Rico. &#160;

The main &#160;

sources of &#160;

tax-exempt interest &#160;

income are &#160;

certain investments &#160;

in obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

U. S. &#160;

Government, its 

agencies and &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

certain obligations &#160;

of the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

and/or its &#160;

agencies and &#160;

municipalities, 

and assets &#160;

held by the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s international banking &#160;

entities. To &#160;

facilitate the comparison &#160;

of interest related &#160;

to these assets, 

the &#160;

interest &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

converted &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis, &#160;

using &#160;

the &#160;

applicable &#160;

statutory &#160;

income &#160;

tax &#160;

rates &#160;

for &#160;

each &#160;

period. &#160;

According to the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

tax law, &#160;

a portion of &#160;

interest cost, based &#160;

on an equal &#160;

proportion of tax-exempt assets &#160;

to total assets, 

and an &#160;

allocation of &#160;

general and &#160;

administrative expenses &#160;

should be &#160;

attributed to &#160;

exempt income, &#160;

reducing the &#160;

benefit of &#160;

the tax 

exempt income, and as such &#160;

the disallowance of such &#160;

deduction is considered in the &#160;

taxable equivalent computation. The effective 

yield, on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, will &#160;

vary depending on &#160;

the level &#160;

of these expenses &#160;

that are &#160;

attributed to the &#160;

available exempt 

income. 

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

is a &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measure. Management &#160;

believes that &#160;

this presentation 

provides meaningful &#160;

information since &#160;

it facilitates &#160;

the comparison &#160;

of &#160;

revenues arising &#160;

from taxable &#160;

and tax-exempt &#160;

sources. Net 

interest &#160;

income &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis &#160;

is &#160;

presented &#160;

with &#160;

its &#160;

different &#160;

components &#160;

in &#160;

Tables &#160;

2 &#160;

and &#160;

3, &#160;

along &#160;

with &#160;

the 

reconciliation to net interest income (GAAP), for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 &#160;

as compared with the same period in 2022, 

segregated by major categories of interest earning &#160;

assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures &#160;

used by &#160;

the Corporation may &#160;

not be &#160;

comparable to &#160;

similarly named &#160;

non-GAAP financial measures 

used by other companies. 

Financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 

&#9679;

&#160;

For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Corporation recorded net income of $ 136.6 million, compared to net income of 

$ 422.4 &#160;

million for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin for &#160;

the second &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023 was &#160;

3.07%, a 

decrease of 25 basis points when compared to &#160;

3.32% for the same quarter of the previous year, &#160;

mainly due to higher deposits 

cost, &#160;

principally from &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

public sector &#160;

and &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

, &#160;

which was &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

higher yield &#160;

from &#160;

money 

market investments &#160;

and loans. On &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, the &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

was 3.24%, compared &#160;

to 3.71% for &#160;

the 

same quarter of the &#160;

previous year. For &#160;

the quarter ended September 30, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation recorded a provision for &#160;

credit 

losses of &#160;

$45.1 million, compared &#160;

to $39.6 &#160;

million for the &#160;

same quarter of &#160;

the previous year. &#160;

The higher provision &#160;

for 2023 &#160;

is 

attributed to &#160;

higher loan &#160;

volumes, migrations &#160;

in credit &#160;

scores &#160;

and changes &#160;

in &#160;

economic variables &#160;

related to &#160;

consumer loan 

portfolios. Non-interest income was &#160;

$159.5 million for the &#160;

quarter, &#160;

a decrease of &#160;

$266.9 million when compared &#160;

to the quarter 

ended September 30, &#160;

2022, mainly due &#160;

to lower other &#160;

operating income, driven &#160;

by the gain &#160;

of $257.7 million &#160;

from the sale &#160;

of 

Evertec &#160;

Inc. &#160;

shares &#160;

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

business &#160;

acquisition &#160;

in &#160;

exchange &#160;

for &#160;

shares &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

sale &#160;

of &#160;

its 

remaining Evertec &#160;

shares, &#160;

(together the &#160;

&#8220;Evertec Transaction &#160;

s&#8221;) &#160;

recognized during &#160;

the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2022. 

Operating expenses were lower by $10.1 million &#160;

principally due to lower other operating &#160;

expenses and professional fees. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Total &#160;

assets at September 30, 2023 amounted to $69.7 billion, compared to $67.6 billion, at &#160;

December 31, 2022. The increase 

was mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher money &#160;

market investments, &#160;

driven by &#160;

the increase &#160;

in deposits, &#160;

and loan &#160;

growth, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by 

lower debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. 

&#9679;

Total &#160;

deposits at September 30, 2023 increased by $2.1 billion when &#160;

compared to deposits at December 31, 2022, mainly due 

to higher Puerto Rico public sector deposits by &#160;

$2.6 billion.

&#9679;

&#160;

Stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $4.5 &#160;

billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of $364.2 million when compared to December 31, 

2022, principally &#160;

due to &#160;

net income for &#160;

the nine-months &#160;

ended September 30, &#160;

2023 of &#160;

$446.7 million, the &#160;

amortization of the 

unrealized losses from securities &#160;

previously reclassified to HTM &#160;

as described above of &#160;

$103.0 million, and the &#160;

positive impact 

from the &#160;

adoption of a &#160;

new accounting standard &#160;

during the year &#160;

of $28.8 million, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by dividends declared &#160;

for the 

nine-month period and the after-tax impact of &#160;

the unfavorable variance in net unrealized &#160;

losses in the portfolio of available-for-

sale securities of $120.8 million. At September 30, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book value per common share was $50.20, 

an increase of $5.23 from December 31, 2022 due &#160;

mainly to the increase in Stockholders&#8217; equity during &#160;

the period. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Regulatory capital ratios continued to be strong. As of September &#160;

30, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital ratio 

was 16.81%, the tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.41%, &#160;

and the total capital ratio was 18.67%. Refer &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

additional discussion &#160;

of significant 

quarterly variances and items impacting the financial performance &#160;

of the Corporation. 

As a financial services company, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected &#160;

by general business and economic conditions 

in the &#160;

markets which &#160;

we serve. &#160;

Lending and &#160;

deposit activities &#160;

and fee &#160;

income generation &#160;

are influenced &#160;

by the &#160;

level of &#160;

business 

spending and &#160;

investment, consumer &#160;

income, spending &#160;

and savings, &#160;

capital market &#160;

activities, competition, &#160;

customer preferences, 

interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on &#160;

competing products. 

The Corporation &#160;

operates in &#160;

a highly &#160;

regulated environment &#160;

and may &#160;

be adversely &#160;

affected by &#160;

changes in &#160;

federal and &#160;

local laws 

and regulations. Also, competition with other financial institutions &#160;

could adversely affect its profitability. 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

continuously &#160;

monitors &#160;

general &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

industry-related &#160;

indicators &#160;

and &#160;

trends, 

competition, interest rate volatility, credit &#160;

quality indicators, loan and deposit demand, operational and systems efficiencies, &#160;

revenue 

enhancements and changes in the regulation of financial &#160;

services companies. &#160;

The description of the Corporation&#8217;s business contained in &#160;

Item 1 of the 2022 Form 10-K, while not all inclusive, &#160;

information about the business of the Corporation. Readers should also refer to &#8220;Part I - Item 1A&#8221; of the 2022 Form 10-K and &#8220;Part II 

- Item 1A&#8221; of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties to which the Corporation is subject, many &#160;

beyond the 

Corporation&#8217;s control that, in addition to the other information in &#160;

this Form 10-Q, readers should consider.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES &#160;

The accounting &#160;

and reporting &#160;

policies followed &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation and &#160;

its subsidiaries &#160;

conform to &#160;

generally accepted &#160;

accounting 

principles &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States &#160;

of &#160;

America &#160;

and &#160;

general &#160;

practices &#160;

within &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

industry. &#160;

Various &#160;

elements &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by &#160;

their nature, are &#160;

inherently subject to &#160;

estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and &#160;

other 

subjective assessments. &#160;

These estimates &#160;

are made &#160;

under facts &#160;

and circumstances &#160;

at a &#160;

point in &#160;

time and &#160;

changes in &#160;

those facts 

and circumstances could produce actual results that &#160;

differ from those estimates. &#160;

Management has discussed &#160;

the development and &#160;

selection of the &#160;

critical accounting policies &#160;

and estimates with &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s 

Audit &#160;

Committee. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

identified &#160;

as &#160;

critical &#160;

accounting &#160;

policies &#160;

those &#160;

related &#160;

to: &#160;

(i) &#160;

Fair &#160;

Value &#160;

Measurement &#160;

of 

Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans &#160;

and Allowance for Credit &#160;

Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired &#160;

with Deteriorated Credit Quality; &#160;

(iv) Income 

Taxes; &#160;

(v) Goodwill and &#160;

Other Intangible Assets; and &#160;

(vi) Pension and Postretirement &#160;

Benefit Obligations. For a &#160;

summary of these 

critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to that particular section in &#160;

the MD&#38;A included in the 2022 Form &#160;

10-K. Also, refer to

Financial Statements &#160;

included in &#160;

the 2022 &#160;

Form 10-K &#160;

for a &#160;

summary of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

significant 

accounting policies and &#160;

to Note &#160;

3 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements included in &#160;

this Form &#160;

10-Q for information &#160;

on recently 

adopted accounting standard updates. 

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income for &#160;

the quarter ended September &#160;

30, 2023 was $534.0 &#160;

million, compared to $579.6 &#160;

million in the same &#160;

quarter 

of &#160;

2022, a &#160;

decrease of &#160;

$45.6 million. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

for the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 2023 &#160;

was $563.7 

million compared to $646.6 million in the third &#160;

quarter of 2022. The decrease in the taxable equivalent net &#160;

interest income is related 

to lower income from tax free &#160;

investment securities and higher disallowed interest expense in the Puerto &#160;

Rico tax computation. The 

latter results from the increase in the Corporation&#8217;s interest &#160;

expense that is attributable to the tax-exempt &#160;

income. &#160;

Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.07% compared to 3.32% in the third quarter of 2022 or a decrease of 25 basis points. On a 

taxable equivalent basis, &#160;

net interest margin for &#160;

the third quarter &#160;

of 2023 was &#160;

3.24%, compared to &#160;

3.71% for the &#160;

same quarter the 

prior year. The main variances in net interest income on a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis were: 

Negative variances: &#160;

&#9679;

Higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$233.2 million &#160;

due to &#160;

the increase &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates that &#160;

has resulted &#160;

in a &#160;

higher 

cost in &#160;

most deposit &#160;

categories in &#160;

both BPPR &#160;

and PB; &#160;

but particularly &#160;

from Puerto &#160;

Rico government &#160;

deposits for &#160;

BPPR 

which are mostly market linked &#160;

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

Higher interest income &#160;

from money market, &#160;

investment, and trading securities &#160;

by $40.5 million &#160;

driven mainly by &#160;

a higher 

yield of money market &#160;

investments, which reflects the increase in &#160;

the Federal funds rate &#160;

of 525 basis points &#160;

since March 

2022, partially offset by &#160;

a lower average volume of &#160;

$2.9 billion, driven by a higher &#160;

volume of loans and a &#160;

lower volume of 

deposits 

&#9679;

Higher &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

loans &#160;

by &#160;

$115.7 &#160;

million &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

average &#160;

loans &#160;

by &#160;

$2.7 

billion reflecting increases &#160;

in both PB and &#160;

BPPR and across most &#160;

major lending segments. Loan &#160;

origination 

in a &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate environment &#160;

and the &#160;

repricing of &#160;

adjustable-rate loans &#160;

resulted in a &#160;

higher yield &#160;

on 

loans by 85 &#160;

basis points. The categories &#160;

with the highest impact &#160;

were commercial loans with &#160;

an increase of 

$72.7 million &#160;

in interest &#160;

income, or &#160;

112 &#160;

basis points, &#160;

and consumer &#160;

loans which &#160;

increased $21.6 &#160;

million in 

interest income, or 165 basis points. &#160;

Net interest income &#160;

for the BPPR &#160;

segment amounted to &#160;

$453.9 million for &#160;

the third quarter &#160;

of 2023, compared &#160;

to $488.1 million &#160;

in 

the third quarter of &#160;

2022. Net interest margin decreased &#160;

to 3.14% compared to &#160;

3.27% in the third &#160;

quarter of 2022. The decrease &#160;

in 

net interest income &#160;

of $34.2 million &#160;

was mainly driven &#160;

by a higher &#160;

interest expense on &#160;

deposits by $182.3 &#160;

million, mainly from &#160;

the 

P.R. &#160;

public sector &#160;

deposits, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by higher &#160;

volume and &#160;

yield on &#160;

loans and &#160;

higher yield &#160;

on investment &#160;

securities, money 

market investments and trading securities. The cost of &#160;

interest-bearing deposits increased 180 basis points to 2.25% from &#160;

0.45% in 

the same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2022. Total &#160;

deposit costs &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter increased &#160;

by 134 &#160;

basis points, &#160;

from 0.34% &#160;

in the &#160;

second quarter &#160;

of 

2022 to 1.68%. 

Net interest income for PB was $87.4 million &#160;

for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, &#160;

compared to $98.9 million during the third 

quarter of 2022, a decrease of $11.4 million. Net interest margin decreased &#160;

94 basis points when compared to the &#160;

third quarter of 

2022 to 2.90%. The decrease in net interest &#160;

margin was mostly driven by a higher &#160;

cost of deposits, partially offset by the increase in 

loan volume and yield of loans due to origination &#160;

of loans in a higher interest rate environment &#160;

and the repricing of adjustable-rate 

loans. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was &#160;

3.31% compared to 0.85%, or an increase of &#160;

246 basis points, while total deposit 

cost was 2.84% compared to 0.67% in the &#160;

third quarter of 2022.

Net interest &#160;

income for &#160;

the nine-months &#160;

period ended &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2023 was &#160;

$1.6 billion, &#160;

or $10.4 &#160;

million lower &#160;

than the &#160;

same 

period in &#160;

2022. Taxable &#160;

equivalent net &#160;

interest income &#160;

was $1.7 &#160;

billion, a &#160;

decrease of &#160;

$97.8 million &#160;

when compared &#160;

to the &#160;

same 

period in 2022. Net interest margin was 3.14%, an increase of 9 &#160;

basis points when compared to 3.05% in 2022. The increase in net 

interest margin was mainly driven by a higher yield on earning assets due to a higher interest rate environment. Net interest margin, 

on &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent basis, &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

nine-months ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

was 3.32%, &#160;

a &#160;

of &#160;

7 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

when 

compared to the 3.39% &#160;

for the same period &#160;

of the variances in &#160;

net interest income for &#160;

the nine-months period 

are: &#160;

Negative variances: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

expense from &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$617.3 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to the &#160;

increase in &#160;

interest rates &#160;

that has &#160;

resulted in &#160;

a 

higher cost in most deposit categories in both BPPR and PB; but particularly from Puerto Rico government deposits for BPPR 

which are mostly market linked. 

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

investment securities, &#160;

trading &#160;

and money &#160;

market investments &#160;

by &#160;

$182.5 resulting &#160;

from &#160;

higher 

yield of the &#160;

portfolio by 96 &#160;

basis points mainly &#160;

driven by money &#160;

market investments, driven &#160;

by the short-term &#160;

investments in 

rising rate interest environment. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest income from commercial loans by &#160;

$227.0 million due to higher yield by &#160;

124 basis points and higher volume of 

$2.0 billion, increasing in BPPR and PB. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

consumer loans &#160;

by $73.6 &#160;

million mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

a higher &#160;

average volume of &#160;

personal loans &#160;

and 

credit cards. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher interest income from construction loans by &#160;

$16.9 million due to higher yield by 292 basis &#160;

points. 

Prepayment penalties, late fees collected and the &#160;

amortization of premiums on purchased loans &#160;

are included as part of the loan 

yield. Interest income related to these items for the &#160;

nine-months ended September 30, 2023, amounted &#160;

to $16.9 million, compared 

to $36.3 million in the same period of 2022. &#160;

The decrease of $19.4 million is mainly related &#160;

to lower amortized fees resulting from 

the forgiveness of PPP loans during 2022, lower amortization &#160;

of premium on auto loans purchased and &#160;

resulting from the 

cancellation of PCD loans.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio &#160;

and Unfunded Commitments 

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2023, the &#160;

Corporation recorded an &#160;

expense of &#160;

$45.2 million &#160;

for its &#160;

reserve for &#160;

credit losses 

related to &#160;

loans held-in-portfolio &#160;

and unfunded &#160;

commitments. The &#160;

provision for &#160;

credit loss &#160;

related to &#160;

the loans-held-in-portfolio &#160;

for 

the quarter &#160;

ended September 30, &#160;

2023 was &#160;

$43.5 million, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision expense of &#160;

$39.5 million for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended 

September 30, 2022. &#160;

The provision expense &#160;

was driven by &#160;

the consumer loan &#160;

portfolio, mainly Auto and &#160;

Personal Loans, partially 

offset by reductions in the provision expense for &#160;

commercial loans. Changes in credit quality, &#160;

higher volumes, and the impact of the 

macroeconomic scenario contributed to the higher provision &#160;

expense for the consumer loans segment. The implementation &#160;

of a new 

ACL &#160;

model &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

U. &#160;

S. &#160;

commercial &#160;

real &#160;

estate &#160;

loan &#160;

segments, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

higher &#160;

recoveries, &#160;

contributed &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

reduction &#160;

in 

provision expense &#160;

for the &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

segment. The &#160;

provision related &#160;

to unfunded &#160;

commitments for &#160;

the third &#160;

quarter of &#160;

was $1.7 million, compared to a provision expense &#160;

of $0.4 million for the same period of 2022. &#160;

As &#160;

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

model &#160;

governance &#160;

procedures &#160;

a &#160;

new &#160;

model &#160;

was &#160;

implemented &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

U.S &#160;

commercial &#160;

real &#160;

estate 

segment. The &#160;

new model &#160;

enhances techniques used &#160;

to capture &#160;

default activity &#160;

within the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s geographical footprint. &#160;

As 

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

implementation &#160;

analysis &#160;

management &#160;

evaluated &#160;

the &#160;

credit &#160;

metrics &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

risk &#160;

ratings, &#160;

delinquency 

levels, and low exposure to &#160;

the commercial office sector. &#160;

Qualitative reserves continue to be &#160;

maintained to address risks within &#160;

the 

U. S. &#160;

commercial real &#160;

estate segment. The &#160;

new model &#160;

including qualitative reserve &#160;

accounted for $15 &#160;

million of &#160;

PB&#8217;s reduction &#160;

in 

ACL.

For the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2023, the &#160;

Corporation recorded &#160;

a provision &#160;

for credit &#160;

loss of &#160;

$54.0 million &#160;

for loans-held-in-

portfolio for the &#160;

BPPR segment, compared to &#160;

a provision expense of &#160;

$28.7 million for &#160;

the quarter ended &#160;

September 30, 2022. &#160;

The 

Popular &#160;

U.S. &#160;

segment &#160;

recorded &#160;

a &#160;

reserve &#160;

release &#160;

of &#160;

$10.5 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

a 

provision of $10.8 million for the same quarter in &#160;

2022. 

For the nine-months ended September 30,2023, the Corporation recorded a &#160;

provision for credit loss of $130.8 million for its &#160;

reserve 

for credit &#160;

losses related &#160;

to loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio and &#160;

unfunded commitments. &#160;

The provision &#160;

expense related &#160;

to the &#160;

loans-held-in-

portfolio for &#160;

the nine-months &#160;

ended September 30,2023 &#160;

was $126.3 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision of &#160;

$35.0 million for &#160;

the nine-

months ended September &#160;

30,2022. The higher &#160;

provision in 2023 &#160;

is attributable to &#160;

higher loan volumes, &#160;

migrations in credit &#160;

scores 

and changes in economic &#160;

variables related to consumer loan &#160;

portfolios, partially offset by changes &#160;

in economic variables related to 

mortgage &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios. &#160;

The &#160;

provision &#160;

for &#160;

unfunded &#160;

commitments &#160;

for &#160;

During the &#160;

first quarter, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

adopted ASU &#160;

2022-02 

which resulted in a reduction of approximately $46 million, $29 million net of tax, in the reserve related to TDRs &#160;

which was recorded 

as an adjustment &#160;

to the beginning &#160;

balance of retained &#160;

earnings. As discussed &#160;

in Note 9 &#160;

to the Consolidated &#160;

Financial Statements, 

within the process to estimate its &#160;

ACL, the Corporation applies probability weightings to &#160;

the outcomes of simulations using Moody&#8217;s

Provision for Credit Losses &#8211; Investment Securities 

At September 30, 2023, &#160;

the total allowance for &#160;

credit losses for this &#160;

portfolio amounted to $6.1 &#160;

million, compared to $6.9 &#160;

million as 

of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 7

to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information on the ACL for this portfolio. 

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$159.5 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$426.5 million &#160;

for &#160;

the 

same quarter of the previous year. The main factors that contributed &#160;

to the variance in non-interest income were: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other operating income by $265.9 million mainly due &#160;

to the gain on sale related to the investment &#160;

in Evertec Transactions 

recognized in July 2022; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

an unfavorable variance of $4.1 million mainly due &#160;

to fair value adjustments of mortgage servicing &#160;

rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;); 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees by $7.0 million mainly due &#160;

to an increase in credit cards transaction volume related &#160;

fee income. 

Non-interest income amounted to $482.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $738.6 million for the 

same period &#160;

of the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

Non-Interest income &#160;

was impacted &#160;

by Evertec &#160;

Transactions and &#160;

the related &#160;

adjustment. Other 

factors that contributed to the variance &#160;

in non-interest income were: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

an unfavorable variance of $20.8 million mainly due &#160;

to fair value adjustments of mortgage servicing rights &#160;

(&#8220;MSRs&#8221;); 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees by $32.8 million mainly due &#160;

to an increase in credit cards transaction volume &#160;

related fee income. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating &#160;

expenses &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$466.0 &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

of &#160;

$10.1 &#160;

million, &#160;

when 

compared with the same quarter of 2022. The &#160;

variance in operating expenses was driven primarily &#160;

by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower incentive compensation and profit-sharing accrual &#160;

by $14.5 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other &#160;

taxes expense &#160;

by $7.4 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

the reversal &#160;

of an &#160;

accrual related &#160;

to regulatory &#160;

examination fees &#160;

in 

BPPR by $8.2 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower professional &#160;

fees &#160;

by $9.1 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

lower advisory &#160;

expenses by &#160;

$7.2 million &#160;

resulting from &#160;

an increase &#160;

in 

projects related to the Corporation&#8217;s transformation initiative &#160;

that are being managed with internal personnel; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other &#160;

operating expenses &#160;

by $14.9 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

the effect &#160;

of prior &#160;

year expense &#160;

of $17.3 million &#160;

related to &#160;

the 

Evertec Transactions; &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by &#160;

higher pension &#160;

plan cost &#160;

by &#160;

$4.8 million &#160;

as a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

annual changes &#160;

in actuarial 

assumptions; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher salaries &#160;

minimum salary &#160;

increases during 

the first quarter of 2023 and higher headcount; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses by $4.6 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher software amortization &#160;

expense by &#160;

$1.7 million 

and higher programming services and application hosting &#160;

expenses by $1.9 million; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher processing and &#160;

transactional services by &#160;

$5.5 million mainly due &#160;

to incentives received &#160;

during July 2022 &#160;

related to the 

ATH Network Participation Agreement entered into in connection with the Evertec &#160;

Business Acquisition Transaction; &#160;

and

$1.4 billion &#160;

for the &#160;

nine months &#160;

ended September &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

an increase &#160;

of $82.2 &#160;

million when 

compared with the same period of 2022, driven primarily &#160;

by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs &#160;

by $53.8 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

salaries by &#160;

$61.7 million &#160;

as a &#160;

result of merit &#160;

and market related 

increases, minimum &#160;

by &#160;

a 

decrease in incentive compensation and profit-sharing &#160;

accrual by $30.3 million; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher processing and transactional services expenses by $14.3 million mainly due &#160;

to broad based retail customers' debit card

of 2023 &#160;

of $2.8 &#160;

million, higher credit &#160;

fees by &#160;

$2.7 million &#160;

and higher &#160;

income tax expense &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter and nine &#160;

months period ended &#160;

September 30, 2023, &#160;

reflects the 

impact of lower pre-tax income, including lower &#160;

volume of income subject to preferential tax rates.

a net deferred tax asset amounting to &#160;

$0.9 billion, net of a valuation &#160;

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable segments &#160;

for managerial &#160;

reporting purposes &#160;

consist of &#160;

Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

Popular 

U.S. A Corporate group &#160;

has been defined to support the reportable &#160;

segments. &#160;

&#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable &#160;

segments, &#160;

including &#160;

additional &#160;

financial &#160;

information &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

underlying 

management accounting process, refer to Note 33 &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

The Corporate group reported a net &#160;

income of $2.8 million for the &#160;

quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared with &#160;

a net income 

of $132.3 million for the same quarter of the previous &#160;

year. The decrease in net income was mainly attributed to the $128.8 &#160;

million in 

after-tax gains &#160;

recognized by &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

as a &#160;

result of &#160;

the Evertec &#160;

stock sale &#160;

and related &#160;

accounting adjustments during &#160;

the 

quarter ended September &#160;

30, 2022. For &#160;

the nine months &#160;

ended September 30, &#160;

2023, the Corporate &#160;

group reported net &#160;

income of 

$8.8 million, compared to a &#160;

net income of $143.4 million for &#160;

the same period of the &#160;

previous year. The decrease &#160;

in net income was 

due to &#160;

impact on 2022 &#160;

of the &#160;

Evertec Stock Sale &#160;

and related accounting &#160;

adjustments; and attributed &#160;

to the &#160;

equity pickup of &#160;

$21.2 

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

nine &#160;

months &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30,2022 &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

investment &#160;

in &#160;

Evertec, &#160;

Inc. &#160;

that &#160;

is &#160;

not &#160;

reflected &#160;

in &#160;

2023 &#160;

as &#160;

the 

Corporation sold its entire ownership stake in &#160;

Evertec in August 2022. &#160;

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable &#160;

segments are discussed below: 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico &#160;

The Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto Rico &#160;

reportable segment&#8217;s net &#160;

income amounted to &#160;

$122.7 million for &#160;

the quarter ended &#160;

September 

30, 2023, compared with &#160;

net income of $263.7 &#160;

million for the same &#160;

quarter of the previous year. &#160;

The factors that contributed to &#160;

the 

variance in the financial results included the following: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower net interest income by $34.2 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$182.3 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs on &#160;

the market-linked &#160;

Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, and &#160;

the &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact on &#160;

the cost &#160;

of &#160;

NOW accounts, 

time deposits, and savings deposits, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

money &#160;

market &#160;

and &#160;

investment &#160;

securities &#160;

by &#160;

$67.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher 

yields driven by the increase in interest rates, 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income &#160;

from loans by &#160;

$80.8 million mainly &#160;

due to higher &#160;

yields from commercial &#160;

and consumer 

loans, &#160;

primarily &#160;

personal &#160;

loans, &#160;

credit &#160;

cards &#160;

and &#160;

auto &#160;

loans &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

increase &#160;

in &#160;

rates, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

higher 

average balances across all portfolios except construction &#160;

loans, 

The net interest margin &#160;

for the quarter ended &#160;

September 30, 2023 was 3.14% &#160;

compared to 3.27% for the &#160;

same quarter in the 

previous year. The decrease in net interest margin is driven by higher &#160;

cost of deposits and the &#160;

earnings assets mix; 

&#9679;

&#160;

A provision &#160;

for loan &#160;

losses expense of &#160;

$51.9 million, compared &#160;

to a &#160;

provision expense of &#160;

$29.8 million in &#160;

quarter ended 

September 30, &#160;

2022, or &#160;

an unfavorable &#160;

variance of &#160;

$22.1 million &#160;

mainly driven &#160;

by the &#160;

consumer loan &#160;

segment, mainly 

auto and personal loans; partially offset by reductions &#160;

in the provision for commercial loans; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was lower by $117.7 million mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower &#160;

other &#160;

operating &#160;

income &#160;

by &#160;

$118.4 &#160;

million &#160;

mostly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

lower &#160;

earnings &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Evertec 

Transactions &#160;

during the quarter ended September 30,2022; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income &#160;

from mortgage &#160;

banking activities &#160;

by $4.0 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

an unfavorable &#160;

variance of &#160;

$3.4 

million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service &#160;

rights. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

lower service charges on &#160;

deposit accounts by $2.3 &#160;

million, mainly due to &#160;

lower ACH fees due &#160;

to the change in 

policy of eliminating insufficient fund fees and modifying &#160;

overdraft fees implemented in the third quarter &#160;

of 2022, 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher other &#160;

service fees &#160;

by $8.4 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

higher credit &#160;

card fees &#160;

by $2.9 &#160;

million and &#160;

debit card 

fees by &#160;

$1.5 million mainly &#160;

as a result &#160;

of higher transactional volume &#160;

and higher merchant &#160;

acquiring fees from 

the revenue sharing agreement with Evertec Inc. by &#160;

$0.4 million. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower operating expenses by $25.7 million mostly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other &#160;

operating expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$27.9 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to &#160;

a $17.3 &#160;

million charge &#160;

related to &#160;

the Evertec 

Transactions &#160;

on the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 2022 &#160;

and lower &#160;

charges allocated &#160;

from the &#160;

Corporate segment &#160;

group by 

$9.3 million; partially offset by $4.4 million of higher pension &#160;

expense based on actuarial assumptions; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower &#160;

other &#160;

operating &#160;

taxes &#160;

expenses &#160;

by &#160;

$7.7 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

reversal &#160;

of &#160;

an &#160;

accrual &#160;

related &#160;

to 

regulatory examination fees in BPPR by $8.2 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower personnel costs by $0.1 million driven by &#160;

lower profit-sharing expense by $8.3 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower business &#160;

promotions by &#160;

$0.5 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to lower &#160;

donations expense &#160;

related to &#160;

natural disasters 

response and other donations; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher net recoveries from OREO by $2.6 million &#160;

mainly due to an increase in units sold; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

transactional &#160;

services &#160;

by &#160;

$5.3 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

credit &#160;

and &#160;

debit &#160;

card 

processing expense as result of higher transactional &#160;

volumes; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher technology &#160;

and software &#160;

expenses by &#160;

$2.8 million &#160;

in part &#160;

due to &#160;

expense savings &#160;

associated with &#160;

the 

acquired services from Evertec during the quarter ended &#160;

September 30,2022; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher professional fees of $3.8 million mainly due &#160;

to costs associated with regulatory and compliance &#160;

efforts; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income tax expense by $7.3 million is &#160;

mainly due lower income before tax. &#160;

For &#160;

the &#160;

nine &#160;

months &#160;

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30,2023, &#160;

the &#160;

BPPR &#160;

segment &#160;

recorded &#160;

net &#160;

income &#160;

of &#160;

$387.4 &#160;

million &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

net 

income of $621.8 million for the same period of the previous year. The results for the nine months ended September 30,2023 reflect 

a provision &#160;

expense of the &#160;

reserve for credit &#160;

losses of $127.0 &#160;

million, reflective of &#160;

higher loan volumes, &#160;

migrations in credit &#160;

scores 

and changes &#160;

in economic &#160;

variables related &#160;

to consumer &#160;

loan portfolios, &#160;

compared to &#160;

a provision &#160;

expense of &#160;

$24.9 million &#160;

for the 

nine months-period ended September 30,2022. &#160;

The other factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results &#160;

included the 

following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $5.7 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

money market &#160;

and &#160;

investment securities &#160;

by &#160;

$249.3 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher 

yields &#160;

from &#160;

money market &#160;

investments, &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

securities and &#160;

mortgage &#160;

backed &#160;

securities due &#160;

to &#160;

the 

increase in rates, 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

loans by &#160;

$246.5 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

average balance &#160;

from &#160;

all portfolios 

except construction loans and higher yields due to the &#160;

increase in rates; &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$489.5 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

costs on &#160;

the market-linked &#160;

Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, and &#160;

the &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact on &#160;

the cost &#160;

of &#160;

NOW accounts, 

time deposits, and savings deposits. 

The net interest margin for the nine &#160;

months ended September 30,2023 was 2.67% compared to 2.49% for the &#160;

same quarter in 

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The increase &#160;

in net &#160;

interest margin &#160;

is driven &#160;

by the &#160;

earning assets &#160;

mix; &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by higher &#160;

cost &#160;

of 

deposits.

&#9679;

&#160;

An unfavorable variance of $102.0 million on the provision for loan &#160;

losses, due to higher loan volumes, migrations in credit 

scores and changes in economic variables related &#160;

to consumer loan portfolios, &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was lower by $106.9 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower other operating income by $109.7 million &#160;

mostly as result of the Evertec Transactions on 2022; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower income from mortgage banking activities by $20.3 million mainly due to an unfavorable variance of $15.3 

million &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

fair &#160;

value &#160;

adjustment &#160;

of &#160;

mortgage &#160;

service &#160;

rights &#160;

and &#160;

lower &#160;

gains &#160;

of &#160;

$5.5 &#160;

million &#160;

on &#160;

hedging 

activities. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Lower &#160;

service &#160;

charges &#160;

on &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts &#160;

by &#160;

$11.9 &#160;

million &#160;

principally &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

lower &#160;

returned &#160;

ACH &#160;

fees &#160;

by 

$10.6 &#160;

million &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

change &#160;

in &#160;

policy &#160;

of &#160;

eliminating &#160;

insufficient &#160;

fund &#160;

fees &#160;

and &#160;

modifying &#160;

overdraft &#160;

fees 

implemented in the third quarter of 2022. &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees by $32.7 million mainly due to higher credit card fees by $14.0 million and higher debit 

card fees by $3.5 million as a result of higher interchange transactional volumes; and higher merchant acquiring 

fees related to the revenue sharing agreement with &#160;

Evertec by $7.9 million; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $51.4 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

personnel &#160;

costs &#160;

by &#160;

$36.5 million &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

salaries &#160;

adjustments &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

by &#160;

$5.5 &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

in &#160;

profit 

sharing accrual by $19.9 million and a decrease &#160;

in incentive compensation by $1.3 million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher professional fees &#160;

by $13.8 million &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to costs &#160;

associated with initiatives &#160;

focused on &#160;

regulatory, 

compliance and cyber security efforts as well as the transformation &#160;

initiative; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower other &#160;

was &#160;

mainly &#160;

The rate &#160;

at &#160;

recovery related Federal assistance and seasonal tax collections, could increase &#160;

public deposit balances at BPPR in the near &#160;

term. 

The amount and timing of any reduction is likely &#160;

approximately &#160;

28% &#160;

the &#160;

Government &#160;

of 

Puerto &#160;

corporations. These &#160;

deposits are &#160;

indexed to &#160;

short-term &#160;

market 

rates and &#160;

fluctuate in &#160;

cost with &#160;

changes in &#160;

those rates &#160;

with a &#160;

one-quarter lag, &#160;

in accordance &#160;

with contractual &#160;

terms. As &#160;

a result, 

these deposits&#8217; &#160;

costs have &#160;

generally lagged &#160;

variable asset &#160;

repricing. Generally, &#160;

these deposits &#160;

require that &#160;

the bank &#160;

pledge high 

credit &#160;

quality securities &#160;

as &#160;

collateral; therefore, &#160;

liquidity risks &#160;

arising from &#160;

public sector &#160;

deposit &#160;

outflows are &#160;

lower. &#160;

REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB &#160;

are subject to regulatory capital &#160;

requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. &#160;

The risk-

based &#160;

capital &#160;

standards &#160;

applicable &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and &#160;

PB &#160;

(&#8220;Basel &#160;

III &#160;

capital &#160;

rules&#8221;) &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

final &#160;

capital 

framework for strengthening international capital standards, known &#160;

as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. &#160;

As 

of September 30, &#160;

2023, the Corporation&#8217;s, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s and PB&#8217;s &#160;

capital ratios continue &#160;

to exceed the &#160;

minimum requirements for being 

&#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules. &#160;

The Basel III capital rules provide that &#160;

a depository institution will be deemed to be &#160;

well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio &#160;

of 

at least 5%, a common equity Tier &#160;

1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a &#160;

Tier 1 capital ratio of &#160;

at least 8% and a total risk-based &#160;

ratio of at least 

10%. Management has determined that as of September 30, 2023, the Corporation, BPPR and PB continue to exceed the minimum 

requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel &#160;

III capital rules. &#160;

Pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

adoption &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

CECL &#160;

accounting &#160;

standard &#160;

on &#160;

January &#160;

2020, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

elected &#160;

to &#160;

use &#160;

the &#160;

five-year 

transition &#160;

period option &#160;

as &#160;

provided in &#160;

the &#160;

final &#160;

interim &#160;

regulatory capital &#160;

rules effective &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2020. &#160;

The &#160;

five-year &#160;

transition 

period provision delays for two &#160;

years the estimated impact &#160;

of CECL on regulatory capital, &#160;

followed by a three-year &#160;

transition period 

to phase &#160;

out the aggregate &#160;

amount of &#160;

the capital benefit &#160;

provided during the &#160;

initial two-year delay. &#160;

As of September &#160;

30, 2023, the 

Corporation had phased-in 50% of &#160;

the cumulative CECL deferral with &#160;

the remaining impact to &#160;

be recognized over the &#160;

remainder of 

the three-year transition period. 

On April 9, &#160;

2020, federal banking regulators &#160;

issued an interim final &#160;

rule to modify &#160;

the Basel III &#160;

regulatory capital rules applicable &#160;

to 

banking organizations to allow &#160;

those organizations participating in &#160;

the Paycheck Protection Program &#160;

(&#8220;PPP&#8221;) established under the 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief &#160;

and Economic Security &#160;

Act (the &#160;

&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) to &#160;

neutralize the regulatory &#160;

capital effects &#160;

of participating in 

the &#160;

program. &#160;

Specifically, &#160;

the &#160;

agencies &#160;

have &#160;

clarified &#160;

that &#160;

banking &#160;

organizations, &#160;

including &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

Bank 

subsidiaries, are permitted to &#160;

assign a zero &#160;

percent risk weight to &#160;

PPP loans for &#160;

purposes of determining risk-weighted &#160;

assets and 

risk-based &#160;

capital &#160;

ratios. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

in &#160;

order &#160;

to &#160;

facilitate &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Paycheck &#160;

Protection &#160;

Program &#160;

Liquidity &#160;

Facility &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;PPPL 

Facility&#8221;), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation&#8217;s Bank subsidiaries to 

fund PPP loans, the &#160;

agencies further clarified that, &#160;

for purposes of determining &#160;

leverage ratios, a banking &#160;

organization is permitted 

to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that have been pledged as collateral for a PPPL Facility. As of September 30, 2023, 

the Corporation has $10 million in PPP loans and no &#160;

loans were pledged as collateral for PPPL &#160;

Facilities.

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023 &#160;

as 

compared to December 31, 2022 was mainly due &#160;

to the nine months period earnings, partially offset &#160;

by higher risk-weighted assets 

driven by the increase in loans held-in-portfolio. &#160;

The increase in leverage capital ratio was mainly &#160;

due to the period earnings.

stemming from the use of

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the &#160;

Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest &#160;

rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk &#160;

refers to the &#160;

risk of a &#160;

reduction in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital due &#160;

to changes in &#160;

the market valuation &#160;

of its assets &#160;

and/or 

liabilities. &#160;

Most of the assets &#160;

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject &#160;

to various categories of interest rate risk, &#160;

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 

option risks. &#160;

In managing &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk, management may &#160;

alter the &#160;

mix of &#160;

floating and &#160;

fixed rate &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, change 

pricing &#160;

schedules, &#160;

adjust &#160;

maturities &#160;

through &#160;

sales &#160;

and &#160;

purchases &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

and &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

derivative &#160;

contracts, 

among other alternatives. &#160;

Interest &#160;

rate &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

an &#160;

active &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

encompasses &#160;

monitoring &#160;

loan &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

flows &#160;

complemented &#160;

by 

investment and funding &#160;

activities. Effective management of &#160;

interest rate risk begins &#160;

with understanding the dynamic &#160;

characteristics 

of assets and &#160;

liabilities and determining the &#160;

appropriate rate risk position &#160;

given line of &#160;

business forecasts, management objectives, 

market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest &#160;

Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 

Economic Value &#160;

of Equity &#160;

(&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The &#160;

three methodologies &#160;

complement each &#160;

other and &#160;

are used &#160;

jointly in &#160;

the evaluation &#160;

of the 

Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII &#160;

simulation modeling is &#160;

prepared for a &#160;

five-year period, which &#160;

in conjunction with &#160;

the EVE analysis, &#160;

provides 

management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest &#160;

income simulation analysis &#160;

performed by legal &#160;

entity and on &#160;

a consolidated basis &#160;

is a &#160;

tool used &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation in 

estimating the &#160;

potential change &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

resulting from &#160;

hypothetical changes &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates. Sensitivity &#160;

analysis is 

calculated using a simulation model which incorporates &#160;

actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity &#160;

and interest yields or costs. &#160;

Management assesses &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk by &#160;

comparing various &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

under different &#160;

interest rate &#160;

scenarios that &#160;

differ in 

direction of interest &#160;

rate changes, the &#160;

degree of change &#160;

and the projected &#160;

shape of the &#160;

yield curve. For &#160;

example, the types &#160;

of rate 

scenarios processed during the &#160;

quarter include flat rates, &#160;

implied forwards, and parallel &#160;

and non-parallel rate shocks. &#160;

Management 

also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis &#160;

and prepayment risk exposures. &#160;

The asset &#160;

and liability &#160;

management group &#160;

performs validation &#160;

procedures on &#160;

various assumptions &#160;

used as &#160;

part of &#160;

the simulation 

analyses as well as validations &#160;

of results on a &#160;

monthly basis. In addition, the &#160;

model and processes used to &#160;

assess IRR are subject 

to independent validations according to the guidelines &#160;

established in the Model Governance and &#160;

Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII &#160;

simulations under interest rate &#160;

scenarios in which the &#160;

yield curve is assumed &#160;

to rise and &#160;

decline by 

the same &#160;

magnitude (parallel &#160;

shifts). The &#160;

rate scenarios &#160;

considered in &#160;

these market &#160;

risk simulations &#160;

reflect instantaneous &#160;

parallel 

changes &#160;

of &#160;

-100, &#160;

-200, &#160;

+100, &#160;

+200 &#160;

and &#160;

+400 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

during the &#160;

succeeding &#160;

twelve-month period. &#160;

Simulation &#160;

analyses &#160;

are 

based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points &#160;

and indexes, interest rate 

spreads, loan prepayments &#160;

and deposit elasticity. &#160;

Thus, they should &#160;

not be &#160;

relied upon as &#160;

indicative of actual &#160;

results. Further, &#160;

the 

estimates &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

contemplate &#160;

actions &#160;

that &#160;

management &#160;

could &#160;

take &#160;

to &#160;

respond &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the 

Corporation is also subject to &#160;

basis risk in the &#160;

repricing of its assets and &#160;

liabilities, including the basis related &#160;

to using different rate 

indexes for &#160;

the repricing &#160;

of assets and &#160;

liabilities, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the effect &#160;

of pricing &#160;

lags which &#160;

may be &#160;

contractual or &#160;

due to &#160;

historical 

differences &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

management &#160;

responses &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

rate &#160;

environment. &#160;

By &#160;

their &#160;

nature, &#160;

these &#160;

forward-looking 

computations are only &#160;

estimates and may &#160;

be different from &#160;

what may actually &#160;

occur in the &#160;

Specifically, &#160;

the &#160;

yield &#160;

rate &#160;

loans &#160;

that &#160;

not &#160;

have &#160;

contractual &#160;

periodic &#160;

floors, &#160;

were &#160;

not 

correctly repricing in the down rate simulations. 

Although as a result of such adjustment the magnitude of the Corporation&#8217;s sensitivity to decreases in interest rates becomes lower, 

as &#160;

of &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

the &#160;

NII &#160;

simulations &#160;

continue &#160;

to &#160;

show &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

a &#160;

neutral &#160;

to &#160;

slightly &#160;

liability &#160;

sensitive 

position driven &#160;

by the &#160;

rapid increase &#160;

in short-term &#160;

interest rates &#160;

throughout the &#160;

year and &#160;

its impact &#160;

on Puerto &#160;

Rico public &#160;

sector 

deposits which are indexed to &#160;

market rates, as well &#160;

as the deployment of cash &#160;

to fund loan growth &#160;

and purchase investments. The 

results as &#160;

of such &#160;

date suggest &#160;

that changes &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

are driven &#160;

by changes &#160;

in liability &#160;

costs, primarily &#160;

Puerto Rico 

public sector &#160;

deposits. In &#160;

declining rate &#160;

scenarios net &#160;

interest income &#160;

would increase &#160;

as the &#160;

decline in &#160;

the cost &#160;

of these &#160;

deposits 

generates a greater benefit than the changes in &#160;

asset yields. In rising rate scenarios Popular&#8217;s sensitivity profile is also impacted &#160;

by 

its large proportion of Puerto Rico public sector deposits &#160;

which are indexed to market rates. 

As of September 30, 2023, NII simulations show the Corporation &#160;

has a relatively neutral sensitivity position as &#160;

compared to a slightly 

liability sensitive position as of December 31, 2022. The primary reasons for the variation in sensitivity are changes in balance sheet 

composition driven &#160;

by an &#160;

increase in &#160;

overnight Fed &#160;

Funds and &#160;

short-term U.S &#160;

Treasury Bills &#160;

(&#8220;T- Bills&#8221;) &#160;

on the &#160;

asset side &#160;

partially 

offset by &#160;

higher Puerto &#160;

Rico public &#160;

sector deposits &#160;

which are &#160;

indexed to &#160;

market rates. &#160;

These results &#160;

suggest that &#160;

changes in &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s net &#160;

interest income sensitivity &#160;

are driven by &#160;

changes in the &#160;

composition of the &#160;

investment portfolio as &#160;

the term &#160;

bond 

portfolio &#160;

continues &#160;

to &#160;

run &#160;

off &#160;

and &#160;

get &#160;

reinvested in &#160;

short-term &#160;

investments such &#160;

as &#160;

T-Bills. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

variation &#160;

in &#160;

liability cost, 

primarily driven by &#160;

Puerto Rico public &#160;

sector deposits that &#160;

represented $17.8 billion &#160;

or 28% of &#160;

deposits as of &#160;

September 30, 2023, 

also impact the sensitivity &#160;

profile. &#160;

In declining rate scenarios net &#160;

interest income would increase as &#160;

the decline in the cost &#160;

of these 

deposit generates a greater benefit than &#160;

the changes in assets yields. &#160;

In rising rate scenarios, Popular&#8217;s net &#160;

interest income is also 

impacted by its large proportion &#160;

of Puerto Rico public sector &#160;

deposit, however the repricing of assets &#160;

as they either reset &#160;

or mature 

lead to an increase in net interest income. 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan and &#160;

investment portfolios &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

prepayment risk, &#160;

which results &#160;

from the &#160;

ability of &#160;

a third-party &#160;

to 

repay debt &#160;

obligations prior &#160;

to maturity. &#160;

Prepayment risk &#160;

also could &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on the &#160;

duration of &#160;

mortgage-backed 

securities &#160;

and &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

since &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

shorten &#160;

(or &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

extend) &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

at its &#160;

subsidiaries, BPPR &#160;

and Popular &#160;

Popular Securities&#8217; &#160;

trading activities &#160;

consist primarily &#160;

of market-making &#160;

activities to &#160;

meet expected &#160;

customers&#8217; needs &#160;

related to &#160;

its

and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and &#160;

government sponsored securities with the objective of 

realizing gains &#160;

from expected &#160;

short-term price &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s trading &#160;

portfolio had a &#160;

5-day VAR &#160;

of approximately $0.3 &#160;

million for the &#160;

September 2023. There &#160;

are 

numerous assumptions &#160;

and estimates &#160;

associated with &#160;

VAR &#160;

modeling, and &#160;

actual results &#160;

could differ &#160;

from these &#160;

assumptions and 

estimates. Backtesting is &#160;

performed to compare &#160;

actual results &#160;

against maximum estimated &#160;

In the opinion of management, the size and composition &#160;

of the trading portfolio does not represent &#160;

a significant source of market risk 

for the Corporation. 

Liquidity &#160;

The objective &#160;

of effective &#160;

liquidity management &#160;

is to &#160;

ensure that &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has sufficient &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

maintain a &#160;

reasonable safety &#160;

margin for &#160;

cash 

needs under &#160;

both normal &#160;

and stressed market &#160;

conditions. The Board &#160;

of Directors &#160;

is responsible &#160;

for establishing the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tolerance for liquidity risk, &#160;

including approving relevant risk limits and &#160;

policies. The Board of &#160;

Directors has delegated the monitoring 

of &#160;

these risks &#160;

to &#160;

the Board&#8217;s &#160;

Risk Management &#160;

An &#160;

may be &#160;

or some &#160;

other event &#160;

that causes &#160;

counterparties to &#160;

avoid exposure &#160;

to the &#160;

institution. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the &#160;

economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets, perceptions of 

the financial services industry and regulatory changes, &#160;

could also affect its ability to obtain funding. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

has adopted &#160;

policies and &#160;

limits to &#160;

monitor the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position and &#160;

that of &#160;

its banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, contingency funding &#160;

plans are used to &#160;

model various stress events &#160;

of different magnitudes and &#160;

affecting different time 

horizons that assist &#160;

management in evaluating &#160;

the size of &#160;

the liquidity buffers &#160;

needed if those &#160;

stress events &#160;

occur. However, &#160;

such 

models &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

predict &#160;

accurately &#160;

how &#160;

the &#160;

market &#160;

and &#160;

customers &#160;

might &#160;

react &#160;

to &#160;

every &#160;

event, &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

dependent &#160;

on &#160;

many 

assumptions. 

Deposits, including &#160;

customer deposits, &#160;

brokered deposits &#160;

and public &#160;

funds deposits, &#160;

continue to &#160;

be the &#160;

most significant &#160;

source of 

funds for the Corporation, funding &#160;

91% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. &#160;

The ratio 

of &#160;

total &#160;

2022. &#160;

In &#160;

addition &#160;

to &#160;

traditional 

deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding balances 

at September &#160;

30, 2023 &#160;

(December 31, &#160;

2022 - &#160;

$1.4 billion). &#160;

of the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Bank of &#160;

New York &#160;

(the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) &#160;

and has &#160;

a considerable &#160;

amount of &#160;

collateral pledged &#160;

that 

can be used to raise funds under these facilities. &#160;

During the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 2023 &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

had no &#160;

material incremental &#160;

information &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

borrowing &#160;

facilities 

available through its banking subsidiaries. &#160;

The principal &#160;

uses of &#160;

funds for &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries include &#160;

loan originations, &#160;

investment portfolio &#160;

purchases, loan &#160;

purchases 

and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 

expenses. Also, the &#160;

banking subsidiaries assume liquidity &#160;

risk related to collateral &#160;

posting requirements for certain &#160;

activities mainly 

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

&#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries maintain &#160;

sufficient funding &#160;

capacity to &#160;

address large &#160;

increases in &#160;

funding requirements &#160;

such as &#160;

deposit 

outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

established &#160;

liquidity &#160;

guidelines &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to 

cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete &#160;

successfully in the marketplace for &#160;

deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 

factors, including pricing, service, convenience &#160;

and financial stability as &#160;

reflected by operating results and &#160;

financial condition, credit 

ratings (by &#160;

nationally recognized credit &#160;

rating agencies), customer &#160;

confidence, and &#160;

importantly, &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance coverage. 

Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured &#160;

(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 

the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 

Deposits are &#160;

a key &#160;

source of &#160;

funding. Refer &#160;

to Table &#160;

8 for &#160;

a breakdown &#160;

of deposits &#160;

by major &#160;

types. Core &#160;

deposits are &#160;

generated 

from a large base of consumer, &#160;

corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include certificate of &#160;

deposit under $250,000, 

all &#160;

interest-bearing &#160;

transactional &#160;

deposit &#160;

accounts, &#160;

non-interest &#160;

bearing &#160;

deposits, &#160;

and &#160;

savings &#160;

deposits. &#160;

Core &#160;

deposits &#160;

exclude 

brokered deposits and certificate of &#160;

deposits over $250,000. Core &#160;

deposits, excluding P.R. &#160;

public funds that are &#160;

fully collateralized, 

have &#160;

historically &#160;

provided &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation with &#160;

a &#160;

sizable &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

relatively stable &#160;

and &#160;

low-cost funds. &#160;

P.R. &#160;

public funds, &#160;

while 

linked to &#160;

market interest &#160;

rates, provide &#160;

a stable &#160;

source of &#160;

funding with &#160;

an attractive &#160;

earnings spread. &#160;

Core deposits &#160;

totaled $58.8 

billion, or &#160;

93% of &#160;

total deposits, &#160;

at September &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

compared with &#160;

$57.6 billion, &#160;

or 94% &#160;

of total &#160;

deposits, at &#160;

December 31, 

2022. Core &#160;

deposits financed &#160;

89% of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

earning assets &#160;

at September &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

compared with &#160;

90% at &#160;

December 

31, 2022. &#160;

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of $250,000 and &#160;

over at September 30, 2023 is presented 

in the table that follows:

The Corporation had &#160;

$1.7 billion in &#160;

brokered deposits at September &#160;

30, 2023, which &#160;

financed approximately &#160;

2% of its &#160;

total assets 

(December 31, 2022 - &#160;

$1.1 billion and 2%, &#160;

respectively). &#160;

In the event that &#160;

any of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory 

capital &#160;

ratios fall &#160;

below those &#160;

required by &#160;

a well-capitalized &#160;

institution or &#160;

are subject &#160;

to capital &#160;

restrictions by &#160;

the regulators, &#160;

that 

banking subsidiary faces &#160;

the risk of &#160;

not being able &#160;

to raise or &#160;

maintain brokered deposits &#160;

and faces limitations &#160;

on the rate &#160;

paid on 

deposits, which &#160;

may hinder &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to &#160;

effectively compete &#160;

in its &#160;

retail markets &#160;

and could &#160;

affect its &#160;

deposit raising 

efforts. &#160;

Deposits from the &#160;

public sector represent &#160;

an important source &#160;

of funds for &#160;

the Corporation. As &#160;

of September 30, &#160;

2023, total public 

sector deposits were $17.8 billion, &#160;

compared to $15.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Generally, &#160;

these deposits require that the bank 

pledge high credit quality securities as &#160;

collateral; &#160;

therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector &#160;

deposit outflows are lower given 

that the bank &#160;

receives its collateral &#160;

in return. This, &#160;

now unpledged, collateral &#160;

can either be &#160;

financed via repurchase &#160;

agreements or 

sold for cash. However, there are some &#160;

timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the &#160;

bank receives 

its &#160;

collateral. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

mainly &#160;

utilizes &#160;

fixed-rate &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

debt &#160;

securities &#160;

as &#160;

collateral. &#160;

While &#160;

these 

securities have &#160;

limited credit risk, &#160;

they are &#160;

subject to &#160;

market value &#160;

risk based on &#160;

changes in &#160;

the interest rate &#160;

environment. &#160;

When 

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

increase, &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

this &#160;

collateral &#160;

decreases &#160;

and &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

having &#160;

to &#160;

provide &#160;

additional 

collateral &#160;

to &#160;

cover &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

liabilities. &#160;

This &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

could &#160;

reduce &#160;

unpledged &#160;

securities &#160;

otherwise 

available as liquidity sources to the Corporation. &#160;

At September 30, 2023, management believes that the &#160;

banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity &#160;

sources to 

meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, &#160;

as well as special needs &#160;

and off-balance sheet commitments, in the &#160;

ordinary course of 

business and have sufficient &#160;

liquidity resources to address a &#160;

stress event. Although the &#160;

banking subsidiaries have historically been 

able to replace &#160;

maturing deposits and advances, &#160;

no assurance can &#160;

be given that &#160;

they would be &#160;

able to replace &#160;

those funds in &#160;

the 

future if the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s financial condition &#160;

or general market &#160;

conditions were to &#160;

deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

financial flexibility 

will &#160;

be &#160;

severely constrained &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

banking subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

unable to &#160;

maintain access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

adequate financing &#160;

is &#160;

not 

available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The &#160;

banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit 

cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase &#160;

agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities. To 

the extent that &#160;

the value of securities &#160;

previously pledged as collateral &#160;

declines because of market &#160;

changes, the Corporation will &#160;

be 

required to &#160;

deposit additional cash &#160;

or securities &#160;

to meet &#160;

its margin requirements, &#160;

thereby adversely affecting &#160;

its liquidity. &#160;

Finally, &#160;

if 

management &#160;

is &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

rely &#160;

more &#160;

heavily &#160;

on &#160;

more &#160;

expensive &#160;

funding &#160;

sources &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

future &#160;

growth, &#160;

revenues &#160;

may &#160;

not 

increase proportionately to cover costs. In this &#160;

case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

The Corporation &#160;

monitors uninsured &#160;

deposits under &#160;

applicable FDIC &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

monitors accounts 

with balances over $250,000. &#160;

While the Corporation has a &#160;

diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, &#160;

corporate and government 

clients, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

$250,000, &#160;

including 

collateralized public funds and deposits outside of the &#160;

U.S. and its territories. &#160;

Collateralized public funds, as presented in Table &#160;

represent public &#160;

deposit balances from &#160;

governmental entities in &#160;

Bank Holding Companies 

The principal &#160;

sources of &#160;

funding for &#160;

the BHCs, &#160;

which are &#160;

Popular, &#160;

Inc. &#160;

(holding company &#160;

and &#160;

non-banking subsidiaries, &#160;

asset sales, &#160;

credit &#160;

facilities &#160;

available from 

affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. &#160;

Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries 

are subject to various regulatory limits &#160;

and authorization requirements that are further described &#160;

below and that may limit the &#160;

ability 

of those subsidiaries to act as a source of &#160;

funding to the BHCs. 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

funds &#160;

includes &#160;

the &#160;

As of &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2023, the &#160;

BHCs had &#160;

cash and &#160;

money markets &#160;

investments totaling &#160;

$368 million &#160;

and borrowing &#160;

potential of 

$222 million from its &#160;

secured facility with BPPR. The BHCs&#8217; &#160;

liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash &#160;

on hand, 

investments and other sources &#160;

of liquidity which are &#160;

expected to be enough &#160;

to meet all &#160;

interest payments and &#160;

dividend obligations 

during the foreseeable future. On March 13, &#160;

2023, the Corporation issued $400 million aggregate principal &#160;

amount of 7.25% Senior 

Notes due &#160;

2028 (the &#160;

&#8220;Notes&#8221;) in &#160;

an underwritten &#160;

public offering. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

used a &#160;

portion of &#160;

the net &#160;

proceeds of &#160;

the 2028 

Notes offering &#160;

to redeem, &#160;

on August 14, &#160;

2023, the outstanding &#160;

$300 million aggregate &#160;

principal amount of &#160;

its outstanding 6.125% 

Senior Notes which were &#160;

due on September 2023. &#160;

For the remainder of &#160;

year 2023, debt service &#160;

at the BHCs is &#160;

approximately $11 

million. Additionally, the Corporation&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.55 per share or &#160;

approximately $40 million per quarter. 

The BHCs have in &#160;

the past borrowed in the &#160;

corporate debt market primarily to finance &#160;

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 

debt obligations. These &#160;

sources of funding &#160;

are more costly &#160;

due to the &#160;

fact that &#160;

two out of &#160;

the three principal &#160;

credit rating agencies 

rate the Corporation below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which &#160;

affects the Corporation&#8217;s cost and &#160;

ability to raise funds in &#160;

the capital markets. 

Factors that the Corporation &#160;

does not control, such &#160;

as the economic outlook, &#160;

interest rate volatility, &#160;

inflation, disruptions in the &#160;

debt 

market, among others, &#160;

could also affect &#160;

its ability to &#160;

obtain funding. The &#160;

Corporation has an &#160;

automatic shelf registration &#160;

statement 

filed and effective &#160;

with the Securities and Exchange &#160;

Commission, which permits the Corporation &#160;

to issue an &#160;

unspecified amount of 

debt or equity securities. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

include &#160;

internally &#160;

generated &#160;

cash &#160;

flows &#160;

from &#160;

operations, &#160;

loan 

sales, repurchase agreements, capital &#160;

injections and borrowed funds &#160;

from their direct &#160;

parent companies or the &#160;

holding companies. 

The principal uses of funds for the non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, &#160;

operational expenses and payment 

of dividends to the &#160;

BHCs. The liquidity needs &#160;

of the non-banking subsidiaries &#160;

are minimal since most &#160;

of them are &#160;

funded internally 

from operating &#160;

cash flows &#160;

or from &#160;

intercompany borrowings or &#160;

capital contributions &#160;

from their &#160;

holding companies. &#160;

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the BHCs received &#160;

dividends amounting to $150 million from BPPR, $50 million 

from PNA and $4 million from its non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, &#160;

2023, Popular

received $14.1 million in &#160;

Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc.&#8217;s primary source of liquidity. &#160;

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

In addition to cash reserves held at the FRB that totaled $ 6.4 billion at September 30,2023, &#160;

the debt securities portfolio provides an 

additional &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

which &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

realized &#160;

through &#160;

either &#160;

securities &#160;

sales, &#160;

collateralized &#160;

borrowings &#160;

or &#160;

repurchase 

agreements. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

debt &#160;

securities &#160;

portfolio &#160;

consists &#160;

primarily &#160;

of &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

that &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

repo &#160;

markets. &#160;

The 

availability &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

repurchase &#160;

agreement &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

having &#160;

sufficient &#160;

unpledged &#160;

collateral &#160;

available &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the 

transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s 

unpledged debt &#160;

securities amounted to &#160;

$ 4.2 &#160;

billion at &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2023 and &#160;

$ 7.8 &#160;

billion at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022. A &#160;

substantial 

portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the U.S. money markets or from secured lending sources, &#160;

subject 

to changes in their fair market value and customary &#160;

adjustments (haircuts). &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Additional liquidity may &#160;

be provided through &#160;

loan maturities, prepayments &#160;

and sales. The &#160;

loan portfolio can &#160;

also be used &#160;

to obtain 

funding in the capital markets. In particular, &#160;

mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have &#160;

secondary markets which the 

Corporation could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments 

In the ordinary course &#160;

of business, the Corporation &#160;

engages in financial transactions that &#160;

are not recorded on &#160;

the balance sheet or 

may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 

provider of &#160;

financial services, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

routinely enters &#160;

into commitments &#160;

with off-balance &#160;

sheet risk &#160;

to meet &#160;

the financial 

needs of &#160;

its customers. These &#160;

commitments may include &#160;

loan commitments and &#160;

standby letters of &#160;

credit. These commitments &#160;

are 

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

credit &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

approval &#160;

used &#160;

for &#160;

on-balance &#160;

instruments. &#160;

These &#160;

instruments &#160;

involve, &#160;

to 

varying degrees, elements &#160;

of credit and &#160;

interest rate risk &#160;

in excess of &#160;

the amount recognized &#160;

in the statement &#160;

of financial position.

FDIC Special Assessments &#160;

On &#160;

May &#160;

11, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Federal &#160;

Deposit &#160;

Insurance &#160;

Corporation &#160;

(&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) &#160;

released &#160;

a &#160;

proposed &#160;

rule &#160;

that &#160;

would &#160;

impose &#160;

special 

assessments &#160;

to &#160;

recover &#160;

the &#160;

losses &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

insurance &#160;

fund &#160;

(&#8220;DIF&#8221;) &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC&#8217;s &#160;

use, &#160;

in &#160;

March &#160;

2023, &#160;

of &#160;

the 

systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under &#160;

the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in connection with the receiverships 

of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. &#160;

The &#160;

FDIC &#160;

stated &#160;

that &#160;

it &#160;

currently &#160;

estimates &#160;

those &#160;

assessed &#160;

losses &#160;

to &#160;

total &#160;

$15.8 &#160;

billion &#160;

and &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

special 

assessments would be adjusted as the loss &#160;

estimate changes. Under the proposed rule, the assessment base would &#160;

be an insured 

depository institution&#8217;s (&#8220;IDI&#8221;) &#160;

estimated uninsured deposits, as &#160;

reported in the &#160;

IDI&#8217;s December 31, &#160;

2022 Call Report, &#160;

excluding the 

first &#160;

$5 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

estimated &#160;

uninsured &#160;

deposits. &#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

holding &#160;

company &#160;

that &#160;

has &#160;

more &#160;

than &#160;

one &#160;

IDI &#160;

subsidiary, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the 

Corporation, the $5 billion exclusion would be &#160;

allocated among the company&#8217;s IDI subsidiaries &#160;

in proportion to each IDI&#8217;s &#160;

estimated 

uninsured deposits. The special assessments would be collected at an &#160;

annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points per year (3.13 

basis points per quarter) over eight quarters in 2024 and 2025, with the first assessment period beginning January 1, 2024 (with &#160;

the 

first &#160;

assessment &#160;

payment &#160;

due &#160;

by &#160;

June &#160;

28, &#160;

2024). &#160;

Under &#160;

the &#160;

proposed &#160;

rule, &#160;

the &#160;

estimated &#160;

loss &#160;

pursuant &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

systemic &#160;

risk 

determination &#160;

would be &#160;

periodically adjusted, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC &#160;

would retain &#160;

the &#160;

ability to &#160;

cease &#160;

collection &#160;

early, &#160;

extend the &#160;

special 

assessment collection period and impose &#160;

a final shortfall special &#160;

assessment on a one-time basis. In &#160;

their December 31, 2022 &#160;

Call 

Reports, BPPR and PB reported estimated uninsured deposits of approximately $28.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. &#160;

Although 

the proposal could be changed, the assessments, as proposed, would &#160;

be recorded as an expense in the period in which this &#160;

change 

is enacted. &#160;

Such expense &#160;

would significantly affect &#160;

noninterest expense and &#160;

the results &#160;

of operations for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

in which &#160;

it is 

recognized. If the &#160;

final rule is &#160;

adopted as proposed, &#160;

the special assessment &#160;

for the &#160;

(together &#160;

with &#160;

PNA, &#160;

the &#160;

&#8220;obligor &#160;

group&#8221;) &#160;

purchased &#160;

by 

statutory trusts &#160;

established by &#160;

the Corporation. &#160;

These debentures &#160;

were purchased &#160;

by the &#160;

statutory trust &#160;

using the &#160;

proceeds from 

trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as &#160;

&#8220;capital securities&#8221;), together with the proceeds of the related issuances 

of common securities of the trusts. 

PIHC &#160;

fully &#160;

unconditionally &#160;

guarantees &#160;

the &#160;

junior &#160;

subordinated &#160;

debentures &#160;

issued &#160;

by &#160;

PNA. &#160;

PIHC&#8217;s &#160;

obligation &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

a 

guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct &#160;

payment of the required amounts to the &#160;

holders of the applicable capital securities or 

by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions 

by &#160;

the &#160;

applicable &#160;

trust &#160;

except &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

extent &#160;

such &#160;

trust &#160;

has &#160;

funds &#160;

available &#160;

such &#160;

payments. &#160;

If &#160;

PIHC &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

make &#160;

interest 

payments on the &#160;

debentures held by such &#160;

trust, such trust &#160;

will not pay &#160;

distributions on the applicable &#160;

capital securities and &#160;

will not 

have &#160;

funds &#160;

available &#160;

for &#160;

such &#160;

payments. &#160;

PIHC&#8217;s &#160;

guarantee &#160;

of &#160;

PNA&#8217;s &#160;

junior &#160;

subordinated &#160;

debentures &#160;

is &#160;

unsecured &#160;

and &#160;

ranks 

subordinate and junior in &#160;

right of payment to &#160;

all the PIHC&#8217;s other &#160;

liabilities in the same manner &#160;

as the applicable debentures as &#160;

set 

forth in the applicable indentures&#894; and equally with all other guarantees &#160;

that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee 

of &#160;

payment &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

of &#160;

collection, &#160;

which means &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

guaranteed party &#160;

may &#160;

sue &#160;

the &#160;

guarantor to &#160;

enforce its &#160;

rights &#160;

under the 

respective guarantee without suing any other person &#160;

Risks to Liquidity &#160;

Total lines of credit outstanding, or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily &#160;

a measure of the total credit 

available &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

continuing &#160;

basis. &#160;

Some &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

lines &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements, &#160;

changes &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

the 

&#160;

collateral, standards of &#160;

creditworthiness, leverage ratios &#160;

and other regulatory &#160;

requirements, among other factors. &#160;

Derivatives, such 

as &#160;

those &#160;

embedded &#160;

in &#160;

long-term &#160;

repurchase &#160;

transactions &#160;

or &#160;

interest &#160;

rate &#160;

swaps, &#160;

and &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

exposures, &#160;

such &#160;

as 

recourse, performance bonds &#160;

or credit card &#160;

arrangements, are subject &#160;

to collateral requirements. &#160;

As their fair &#160;

value increases, the 

collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing &#160;

the balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

market for the &#160;

Corporation is an &#160;

additional risk factor &#160;

that could affect &#160;

its financing activities. &#160;

In 

the case &#160;

of a &#160;

deterioration in economic &#160;

and fiscal conditions &#160;

in Puerto Rico, &#160;

the credit quality &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation could be &#160;

affected 

and result &#160;

in higher &#160;

credit costs. &#160;

Refer to &#160;

the Geographic &#160;

and Government &#160;

Risk section &#160;

of this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

some highlights &#160;

on the 

current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing &#160;

fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic &#160;

outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory 

changes, &#160;

could also &#160;

affect &#160;

its &#160;

ability to &#160;

obtain funding. &#160;

In &#160;

order to &#160;

prepare for &#160;

the &#160;

possibility of &#160;

such scenario, &#160;

management &#160;

has 

adopted &#160;

contingency &#160;

plans &#160;

for &#160;

raising &#160;

financing &#160;

under &#160;

stress &#160;

scenarios &#160;

when &#160;

important &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funds &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

usually &#160;

fully 

available &#160;

are &#160;

temporarily &#160;

unavailable. These &#160;

plans call &#160;

for &#160;

using &#160;

alternate &#160;

funding &#160;

mechanisms, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

pledging &#160;

of &#160;

certain 

asset classes &#160;

and accessing &#160;

secured credit &#160;

lines and &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

put in &#160;

place with &#160;

the FHLB &#160;

and the &#160;

FRB. The &#160;

Corporation is 

subject to &#160;

positive tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements to &#160;

utilize secured &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

with the &#160;

FHLB that &#160;

could &#160;

result in &#160;

a limitation &#160;

of 

borrowing amounts or maturity terms, even if the Corporation &#160;

exceeds well-capitalized regulatory capital levels. &#160;

The credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

Popular&#8217;s debt &#160;

obligations are &#160;

a relevant &#160;

factor for &#160;

liquidity because &#160;

they impact &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to 

borrow &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets, &#160;

its &#160;

cost &#160;

and &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

sources. &#160;

Credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

strength, &#160;

credit 

quality and &#160;

concentrations in &#160;

the loan &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

level and &#160;

volatility of &#160;

earnings, capital &#160;

adequacy, &#160;

the quality &#160;

of management, 

geographic concentration &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico, the &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet, the &#160;

availability of &#160;

a significant &#160;

base of &#160;

core retail &#160;

and 

commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access &#160;

a broad array of wholesale funding sources, &#160;

among other factors. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

various &#160;

statutory &#160;

provisions &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

dividends &#160;

an &#160;

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

pay &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

holding 

company without &#160;

regulatory approval. A &#160;

member bank must &#160;

obtain the &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

for any &#160;

dividend, if 

the total &#160;

of all &#160;

dividends declared &#160;

by the &#160;

member bank &#160;

during the &#160;

calendar year &#160;

would exceed &#160;

the total &#160;

of its &#160;

net income &#160;

for that 

year, &#160;

combined with &#160;

its retained &#160;

net income &#160;

for the &#160;

preceding two &#160;

years, after &#160;

considering those &#160;

years&#8217; dividend &#160;

activity, &#160;

less any 

required transfers &#160;

to surplus &#160;

or to &#160;

a fund &#160;

for the &#160;

retirement of &#160;

any preferred &#160;

stock. During &#160;

the nine &#160;

months ended &#160;

September 30, 

2023, BPPR declared cash dividends &#160;

of $150 million. At September &#160;

30, 2023, BPPR can declare &#160;

a dividend of approximately $402 

million without &#160;

prior approval &#160;

of the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Board due &#160;

to its &#160;

retained income, &#160;

declared dividend activity &#160;

and transfers &#160;

to 

statutory &#160;

reserves &#160;

over &#160;

the &#160;

measurement &#160;

period. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

a &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

declare &#160;

or &#160;

pay &#160;

a &#160;

dividend &#160;

in &#160;

an &#160;

amount 

greater &#160;

than &#160;

its &#160;

undivided &#160;

profits &#160;

as &#160;

reported &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

Report &#160;

of &#160;

Condition and &#160;

Income, &#160;

unless &#160;

the &#160;

member &#160;

bank &#160;

has &#160;

received &#160;

the 

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. A &#160;

member bank also &#160;

may not permit &#160;

any portion of &#160;

its permanent capital &#160;

to be &#160;

withdrawn 

unless the &#160;

withdrawal has been &#160;

approved by &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. &#160;

Pursuant to &#160;

these requirements, PB &#160;

may not &#160;

declare or 

pay a &#160;

dividend without &#160;

the prior &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

and the &#160;

NYSDFS. The &#160;

ability of &#160;

a bank &#160;

subsidiary to &#160;

up-

stream &#160;

dividends &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

BHC &#160;

could &#160;

thus &#160;

be &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

its &#160;

financial &#160;

performance &#160;

and &#160;

capital, &#160;

including &#160;

tangible &#160;

and &#160;

regulatory 

capital, thus potentially limiting the &#160;

amount of cash moving &#160;

up to the BHCs from &#160;

the banking subsidiaries. This could, &#160;

in turn, affect 

the &#160;

BHCs &#160;

ability to &#160;

declare dividends &#160;

on &#160;

its &#160;

outstanding common &#160;

and &#160;

preferred stock, &#160;

repurchase its &#160;

securities &#160;

or meet &#160;

its &#160;

debt 

obligations, for example. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not &#160;

used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance &#160;

its operations, and 

therefore are less sensitive to the level and &#160;

changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

currently &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

issue &#160;

unsecured &#160;

senior &#160;

debt, &#160;

as &#160;

these &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

funded 

primarily with &#160;

deposits and secured &#160;

borrowings. The banking &#160;

subsidiaries had $7.8 &#160;

million in &#160;

deposits at &#160;

September 30, 2023 &#160;

that 

are subject to rating triggers. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

certain mortgage servicing &#160;

and custodial agreements &#160;

that BPPR &#160;

has with &#160;

third parties &#160;

include rating covenants. &#160;

In the 

event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 

escrow &#160;

deposits &#160;

and/or &#160;

increase &#160;

collateral &#160;

levels &#160;

securing &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of &#160;

our financial &#160;

activities and &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure is &#160;

concentrated in &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

(&#8220;Puerto 

Rico&#8221;), which has faced severe economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the past and may face additional &#160;

challenges in the future. &#160;

Economic Performance. &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy suffered &#160;

a &#160;

severe and &#160;

prolonged recession &#160;

from &#160;

2007 &#160;

to &#160;

2017, &#160;

with real &#160;

gross national &#160;

product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) 

contracting approximately 15% &#160;

during this period. &#160;

In 2017, Hurricane &#160;

Mar&#237;a caused significant &#160;

damage and destruction &#160;

across the 

island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in &#160;

part aided by 

the large amount &#160;

of federal disaster &#160;

relief and recovery &#160;

assistance funds injected &#160;

into the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy in &#160;

connection with 

Hurricane Mar&#237;a &#160;

and other &#160;

recent natural &#160;

disasters. This &#160;

growth was &#160;

interrupted by &#160;

the economic &#160;

shock caused &#160;

by the &#160;

COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part &#160;

aided by additional federal assistance from &#160;

pandemic-related stimulus measures.

by &#160;

the &#160;

Economic &#160;

Development Bank &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;Economic 

Activity Index&#8221;), &#160;

reflected a &#160;

3.3% year-over-year increase &#160;

and a &#160;

0.2% month-over-month decrease &#160;

in August &#160;

2023. The &#160;

Economic 

Activity Index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real GNP. In February 2023, the 

Puerto Rico &#160;

Planning Board &#160;

revised its &#160;

real GNP &#160;

forecast for &#160;

the current &#160;

fiscal year &#160;

(July 2022-June &#160;

2023) from &#160;

1.7% growth &#160;

to 

0.7% growth, citing an anticipated deacceleration in the &#160;

global economy. &#160;

While the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy has &#160;

not directly &#160;

tracked the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy in &#160;

recent years, &#160;

many of &#160;

the external &#160;

factors 

that impact &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

are affected &#160;

by the &#160;

policies and performance &#160;

of the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy. &#160;

These external 

factors include &#160;

the level &#160;

of interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

the rate &#160;

of inflation. &#160;

Inflation in &#160;

States, as &#160;

measured by the &#160;

United States 

Consumer &#160;

Price &#160;&#160;

(published &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Bureau &#160;

of &#160;

Labor &#160;

Statistics), &#160;

increased &#160;

3.7% &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

12-month &#160;

period &#160;

ended 

September 2023. &#160;

Inflation in Puerto Rico, as measured by &#160;

the Puerto Rico Consumer Price Index &#160;

(published by the Department of 

Labor &#160;

and &#160;

Human &#160;

Resources of &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico), &#160;

increased 3.3% &#160;

during the &#160;

12-month &#160;

period &#160;

ended September &#160;

2023. &#160;

The &#160;

rate &#160;

of 

inflation has &#160;

gradually decreased from &#160;

a mid-2022 &#160;

peak, as the &#160;

Federal Reserve has &#160;

implemented a series &#160;

of benchmark interest 

rate increases. The speed and scope of the inflation &#160;

slowdown will inform if and how much interest rates &#160;

will continue to increase, as 

well how these changes will impact the United &#160;

States and Puerto Rico economies. 

Fiscal Challenges. &#160;

As the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy contracted, the &#160;

government&#8217;s public &#160;

debt rose &#160;

rapidly, &#160;

in part &#160;

from borrowing to &#160;

cover deficits &#160;

to pay 

debt service, &#160;

pension benefits and &#160;

other government &#160;

expenditures. By 2016, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government had &#160;

over $120 &#160;

billion in 

combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had &#160;

lost access to the capital markets, and was in &#160;

the midst of a fiscal crisis. 

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

escalating fiscal &#160;

and economic &#160;

challenges &#160;

and imminent &#160;

widespread defaults &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

public debt &#160;

prompted the &#160;

U.S. 

Congress to &#160;

enact the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Oversight, Management, &#160;

and Economic &#160;

Stability Act &#160;

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in &#160;

June 2016. &#160;

PROMESA 

created the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; with ample powers over Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 

instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, &#160;

&#8220;PR Government Entities&#8221;). Pursuant &#160;

to PROMESA, the &#160;

Oversight Board will be &#160;

in 

place &#160;

until &#160;

market &#160;

access &#160;

is &#160;

restored &#160;

and &#160;

balanced &#160;

budgets &#160;

are &#160;

produced &#160;

for &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

four &#160;

consecutive &#160;

years. &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

also 

established two &#160;

mechanisms for &#160;

the restructuring &#160;

of the &#160;

obligations of &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities: (a) &#160;

Title III, &#160;

which provides &#160;

an in-

&#160;

&#160;

court process that incorporates many of the &#160;

powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &#160;

and permits adjustment of a broad 

range of obligations, and &#160;

(b) Title VI, &#160;

which provides for a &#160;

largely out-of-court process through which &#160;

modifications to financial debt 

can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors &#160;

and bind holdouts. 

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several &#160;

of its instrumentalities have availed themselves &#160;

of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 

III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 

including Government &#160;

Development Bank for &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico Sales &#160;

Tax &#160;

Financing Corporation, and &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico 

Highways &#160;

and &#160;

Transportation &#160;

Authority, &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

completed &#160;

debt &#160;

restructurings &#160;

under &#160;

Titles &#160;

III &#160;

or &#160;

VI &#160;

of &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

While &#160;

the 

majority &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debt &#160;

has &#160;

already &#160;

been &#160;

restructured, &#160;

some &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities &#160;

still &#160;

face &#160;

significant &#160;

fiscal &#160;

challenges. &#160;

For 

example, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority is still in the process &#160;

of restructuring its debts under Title III of PROMESA and the 

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Industrial &#160;

Development &#160;

Company &#160;

recently &#160;

commenced &#160;

a &#160;

solicitation &#160;

process &#160;

to &#160;

restructure &#160;

its &#160;

revenue &#160;

bonds &#160;

in &#160;

a 

proceeding under Title VI of PROMESA. &#160;

Municipalities. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges have &#160;

also adversely impacted its municipalities. Budgetary subsidies to municipalities 

have &#160;

gradually declined &#160;

in recent &#160;

years &#160;

and &#160;

were scheduled &#160;

to &#160;

be ultimately &#160;

eliminated by &#160;

fiscal year &#160;

2025 &#160;

as &#160;

part &#160;

of the &#160;

fiscal 

measures required &#160;

by &#160;

the Oversight &#160;

Board. However, &#160;

over the &#160;

past &#160;

years, the &#160;

Oversight Board &#160;

has &#160;

authorized and &#160;

funded &#160;

new 

appropriations &#160;

and &#160;

investments &#160;

to &#160;

offset &#160;

the &#160;

decline &#160;

in &#160;

intergovernmental &#160;

transfers &#160;

to &#160;

municipalities. &#160;

Beyond &#160;

those &#160;

sources &#160;

of 

alternate funding, municipalities have &#160;

also received significant federal &#160;

disaster and COVID-relief funding in &#160;

recent years. According 

to the &#160;

latest Puerto &#160;

Rico fiscal &#160;

plan certified &#160;

by the &#160;

Oversight Board, &#160;

taken together, &#160;

the funding &#160;

available to &#160;

municipalities in &#160;

the 

near-term is substantial. The fiscal &#160;

plan notes, however, that &#160;

the desired progress to achieve &#160;

fiscal discipline and implement critical 

reforms has not been achieved, &#160;

and that municipalities must work with &#160;

the Executive branch to analyze &#160;

the financial needs of &#160;

each 

individual municipality and focus on the necessary enhancements in municipal shared services and other &#160;

municipal and government 

initiatives. Pursuant to &#160;

the fiscal plan, &#160;

once the transformational measures &#160;

and milestones related to &#160;

these initiatives are &#160;

achieved, 

additional funding from the central government may be &#160;

made available to municipalities to improve fiscal &#160;

sustainability. 

Municipalities &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

and, &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board&#8217;s &#160;

request, &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

submit &#160;

fiscal &#160;

plans &#160;

and &#160;

annual 

budgets &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

for &#160;

its &#160;

review &#160;

and &#160;

approval. &#160;

They &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

required to &#160;

seek &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

approval &#160;

to &#160;

issue, 

guarantee &#160;

or &#160;

modify &#160;

their &#160;

debts &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

contracts &#160;

with an &#160;

aggregate &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

$10 &#160;

million &#160;

or &#160;

more. &#160;

With &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight 

Board&#8217;s approval, municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. To 

date, however, no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring &#160;

process. 

Exposure of the Corporation &#160;

The credit &#160;

quality of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

reflects, among other &#160;

things, the &#160;

general economic conditions &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

other 

adverse conditions affecting Puerto &#160;

Rico consumers and businesses. &#160;

Deterioration in the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy has resulted &#160;

in the 

past, and could &#160;

result in the future, &#160;

in higher delinquencies, greater &#160;

charge-offs and increased losses, &#160;

which could materially affect 

our financial condition and results of operations. &#160;

At September &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

to PR &#160;

Government Entities &#160;

totaled $362 &#160;

million, of &#160;

which $333 &#160;

million 

were &#160;

outstanding, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$374 &#160;

million &#160;

at &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

of &#160;

which &#160;

$327 &#160;

million &#160;

were &#160;

outstanding. &#160;

A &#160;

deterioration &#160;

in 

Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal &#160;

and economic situation could adversely &#160;

affect the value of &#160;

our Puerto Rico government &#160;

obligations, resulting in 

losses to us. Of &#160;

the amount outstanding, $314 million &#160;

consists of loans and &#160;

$19 million are securities ($302 &#160;

million and $25 million, 

respectively, &#160;

at December 31, &#160;

2022). All &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure &#160;

outstanding at September &#160;

30, 2023 &#160;

were obligations 

from various &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

municipalities. In &#160;

most cases, &#160;

these were &#160;

&#8220;general obligations&#8221; &#160;

of a &#160;

municipality, &#160;

to which &#160;

the applicable 

municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged its &#160;

good &#160;

faith, credit &#160;

and unlimited &#160;

taxing power, &#160;

or &#160;

&#8220;special obligations&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to &#160;

which the 

applicable municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged basic &#160;

property tax &#160;

or sales &#160;

tax &#160;

revenues. At &#160;

September 30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

76% of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s 

exposure to &#160;

municipal loans &#160;

and securities &#160;

was concentrated &#160;

in the &#160;

municipalities of &#160;

San Juan, &#160;

Guaynabo, Carolina &#160;

and Caguas. 

For &#160;

additional &#160;

discussion &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and 

municipalities, refer to Note 21 &#8211; Commitments and &#160;

Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

at &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

$242 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

loans &#160;

insured &#160;

or &#160;

securities &#160;

issued &#160;

by &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

governmental entities, &#160;

but for &#160;

which the &#160;

principal source &#160;

of repayment &#160;

is non-governmental &#160;

($251 million at &#160;

December 31, 2022). 

These &#160;

included &#160;

$195 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

residential mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

insured by &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Housing &#160;

Finance Authority &#160;

(&#8220;HFA&#8221;), &#160;

a PR 

Government &#160;

Entity &#160;

(December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022 &#160;

- &#160;

$209 million). &#160;

These &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

are &#160;

secured &#160;

by &#160;

first &#160;

mortgages &#160;

on &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

residential properties &#160;

and the &#160;

HFA insurance &#160;

covers losses &#160;

in the &#160;

event of &#160;

a borrower &#160;

default and &#160;

upon the &#160;

satisfaction of &#160;

certain 

other &#160;

conditions. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation also &#160;

had &#160;

at &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

$40 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

bonds &#160;

issued &#160;

by &#160;

HFA &#160;

which &#160;

are &#160;

secured &#160;

by 

second &#160;

mortgage loans &#160;

on Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

residential properties, &#160;

and for &#160;

which HFA &#160;

also provides &#160;

insurance to &#160;

cover losses &#160;

in the 

event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of &#160;

certain other conditions (December 31, 2022 - $42 million). &#160;

In the event that 

the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those &#160;

serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and 

the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s &#160;

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among 

other factors, &#160;

on the &#160;

financial condition &#160;

of HFA &#160;

at the &#160;

time such &#160;

obligations become &#160;

due and &#160;

payable. The &#160;

Corporation does &#160;

not 

consider the government guarantee when estimating &#160;

the credit losses associated with this portfolio. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio also &#160;

includes loans &#160;

to &#160;

private borrowers &#160;

who &#160;

are service &#160;

providers, lessors, &#160;

suppliers or &#160;

have 

other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively &#160;

affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and &#160;

economic 

situation &#160;

of &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities. &#160;

Similarly, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

government 

employees &#160;

and &#160;

retirees, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

be &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

employee &#160;

layoffs &#160;

or &#160;

furloughs &#160;

or 

reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic &#160;

situation deteriorates. 

As &#160;

of &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

BPPR &#160;

had &#160;

$17.8 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

deposits &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government, &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities, &#160;

and 

municipalities. The rate at &#160;

which public deposit balances may &#160;

decline is uncertain and &#160;

difficult to predict. The &#160;

amount and timing of 

any such &#160;

reduction is &#160;

likely to &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for example, &#160;

the speed &#160;

at which &#160;

federal assistance &#160;

is distributed &#160;

and the &#160;

financial 

condition, liquidity &#160;

and cash &#160;

management practices of &#160;

such entities, &#160;

as well &#160;

as on &#160;

the ability &#160;

of BPPR &#160;

to maintain &#160;

these customer 

relationships. 

The &#160;

Corporation may &#160;

also have &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure with &#160;

regards to &#160;

avoidance and &#160;

other causes &#160;

of &#160;

action initiated &#160;

by the &#160;

Oversight 

Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 21 

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

United States Virgin Islands 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

operations &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States &#160;

Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;USVI&#8221;) &#160;

and &#160;

has &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

USVI &#160;

government 

entities. 

The USVI has &#160;

been experiencing a &#160;

number of fiscal &#160;

and economic challenges, &#160;

which could adversely &#160;

affect the &#160;

ability of its &#160;

public 

corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding &#160;

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI &#160;

and, as such, 

there &#160;

is &#160;

currently &#160;

no &#160;

federal &#160;

legislation &#160;

permitting &#160;

the &#160;

restructuring &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debts &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

USVI &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

public &#160;

corporations &#160;

and 

instrumentalities. 

To &#160;

the extent that &#160;

the fiscal condition &#160;

of the USVI &#160;

continues to deteriorate, the &#160;

U.S. Congress or the &#160;

Government of the &#160;

USVI may 

enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the &#160;

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a &#160;

stay on creditor 

remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable &#160;

to the USVI. 

At September 30, &#160;

2023, the Corporation &#160;

had approximately $28 &#160;

million in direct &#160;

exposure to USVI &#160;

government entities (December 

31, 2022 - $28 million). &#160;

British Virgin Islands 

The &#160;

operations &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

British Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(&#8220;BVI&#8221;), &#160;

which &#160;

was &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected by &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic, 

particularly as &#160;

a reduction &#160;

in the &#160;

tourism activity &#160;

which accounts &#160;

for a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of its &#160;

economy. &#160;

Although the &#160;

no &#160;

significant &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

at &#160;

September &#160;

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

it &#160;

has &#160;

a &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolio &#160;

amounting &#160;

to 

approximately &#160;

$201 &#160;

comprised &#160;

of &#160;

various &#160;

retail &#160;

$214 &#160;

at

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes &#160;

6 and 7 to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s investment 

securities &#160;

represented exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Government in &#160;

the &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

agency 

mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.7 billion &#160;

of residential mortgages, $10 million of SBA loans under the 

Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and $72 million &#160;

commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by &#160;

the U.S. Government or its 

agencies at September 30, 2023 (compared to &#160;

$1.6 billion, $38 million and $72 million, respectively, at December 31, &#160;

2022).

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) &#160;

include primarily past-due &#160;

loans that &#160;

are no &#160;

longer accruing interest, &#160;

renegotiated loans, and &#160;

real 

estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit &#160;

quality metrics, is presented in Table 21. 

During the &#160;

third quarter &#160;

of 2023, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

continued to &#160;

reflect stable &#160;

credit quality &#160;

metrics. Non-performing &#160;

loans (&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) 

and net charge offs (&#8220;NCOs&#8221;) continued below historical pre-pandemic averages. Consumer portfolios, however, reflected increased 

delinquencies and NCOs for the quarter primarily due &#160;

to the expected continued credit normalization. &#160;

We continue to closely monitor 

changes in the macroeconomic environment and on &#160;

borrower performance, especially our unsecured consumer loans, given higher 

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

inflationary &#160;

pressures. &#160;

However, &#160;

management &#160;

believes &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

improvements &#160;

over &#160;

recent &#160;

years &#160;

in &#160;

risk 

management practices and the &#160;

risk profile of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios &#160;

positions Popular to continue &#160;

to operate successfully 

under the current environment. &#160;

Total &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

higher 

construction NPLs &#160;

by $7 &#160;

million. &#160;

The consumer &#160;

NPLs decrease &#160;

was mostly &#160;

driven by &#160;

a $11 &#160;

million line &#160;

of credit &#160;

charge-off on &#160;

a 

single relationship, &#160;

while the &#160;

construction NPLs &#160;

increase was &#160;

driven by &#160;

a $9 &#160;

which impairment &#160;

$3 

million was &#160;

charged-off during &#160;

the third &#160;

NPLs decreased &#160;

by $10 &#160;

million from &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022, 

mainly driven by &#160;

lower mortgage NPLs by &#160;

$9 million. On September &#160;

30, 2023, the &#160;

ratio of NPLs to &#160;

total loans held-in-portfolio was 

1.1% compared to 1.4%, at December 31, &#160;

2022. Other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) decreased by &#160;

$7 million. On September 

30, &#160;

2023, &#160;

NPLs secured &#160;

representing only 1.9% &#160;

or 

$635 million &#160;

of our &#160;

total loan &#160;

The exposure is &#160;

mainly comprised of &#160;

low- to &#160;

mid- rise &#160;

properties with average &#160;

loan size &#160;

of 

$2.1 million and is well diversified across tenant &#160;

CRE NPLs amounted to $56 million at September 30, 2023, compared with $54 million at December 31, 2022. The &#160;

CRE NPL ratios 

for the BPPR &#160;

million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2022. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment increased 

slightly by $2 million, compared to the same period in &#160;

2022. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the Popular &#160;

U.S. segment decreased

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, &#160;

2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), 

represents management&#8217;s estimate &#160;

of expected credit &#160;

losses through the &#160;

remaining contractual life &#160;

of the &#160;

different loan segments, 

impacted by expected &#160;

prepayments. The ACL &#160;

is maintained at &#160;

a sufficient &#160;

level to provide &#160;

for estimated credit &#160;

losses on collateral 

dependent &#160;

loans &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

loans &#160;

modified &#160;

to &#160;

borrowers &#160;

with &#160;

financial &#160;

difficulty, &#160;

including &#160;

legacy &#160;

troubled &#160;

debt &#160;

restructurings, 

separately &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

remainder &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolio. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

management &#160;

evaluates &#160;

the &#160;

adequacy &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

on &#160;

a 

quarterly &#160;

basis. &#160;

In &#160;

this &#160;

evaluation, &#160;

management &#160;

considers &#160;

current &#160;

conditions, &#160;

macroeconomic &#160;

economic &#160;

expectations &#160;

through &#160;

a 

reasonable and supportable period, &#160;

historical loss experience, portfolio composition &#160;

by loan type &#160;

and risk characteristics, results &#160;

of 

periodic credit reviews &#160;

of individual loans, &#160;

and regulatory requirements, amongst &#160;

other factors. The &#160;

Corporation evaluates, at &#160;

least 

on an &#160;

annual basis, the &#160;

assumptions tied to &#160;

the CECL &#160;

accounting framework, including &#160;

the reasonable and &#160;

supportable period as 

well as the reversion window. &#160;

The Corporation must rely on &#160;

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where &#160;

the ultimate outcome is unknown, such &#160;

as 

economic developments affecting specific &#160;

customers, industries, or markets. &#160;

Other factors that can &#160;

affect management&#8217;s estimates 

are &#160;

recalibration &#160;

of &#160;

statistical &#160;

models &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

calculate &#160;

lifetime &#160;

expected &#160;

losses, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

financial 

accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, &#160;

among others. Changes in the financial condition &#160;

of individual borrowers, 

in economic &#160;

conditions, and &#160;

in the &#160;

condition of &#160;

the various &#160;

markets in &#160;

which collateral &#160;

may be &#160;

sold, may &#160;

also affect &#160;

the required 

level of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses. Consequently, &#160;

the business &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

capital, and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

could also be affected. 

The &#160;

ACL &#160;

incorporated &#160;

updates macroeconomic &#160;

scenarios &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States. &#160;

Given &#160;

that &#160;

any &#160;

one &#160;

economic 

outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its ACL. The baseline scenario continues to 

be assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic scenario, &#160;

and then the optimistic scenario. 

The &#160;

2023 &#160;

annualized GDP &#160;

growth in &#160;

the &#160;

baseline scenario &#160;

improved to &#160;

1.7% &#160;

and &#160;

2.0% &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States, 

respectively, compared to 1.5% and 1.6% &#160;

in the previous quarter. The 2023 forecasted average unemployment rate for &#160;

Puerto Rico 

improved to &#160;

6.1% from &#160;

6.3% in &#160;

the previous &#160;

forecast, while &#160;

in the &#160;

United States &#160;

unemployment levels &#160;

remained at &#160;

3.6%, stable 

when compared to the previous forecast. &#160;

At September &#160;

30, 2023, &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses amounted &#160;

to $711 &#160;

million, a &#160;

decrease of &#160;

$9 million, &#160;

when compared &#160;

with 

December 31, 2022. &#160;

In PB the &#160;

ACL decreased by &#160;

$18 million from &#160;

December 31, 2022, &#160;

while in BPPR &#160;

the ACL increased &#160;

by $9 

million. The Financial Accounting Standards Board &#160;

(&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards &#160;

Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2022-02 in March &#160;

2022, 

which eliminates the &#160;

accounting guidance for troubled &#160;

debt restructures (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and &#160;

the requirement to &#160;

measure the effect &#160;

of the 

concession from a loan modification, for which the Corporation used a discounted cash flow (&#8220;DCF&#8221;) method. This impact resulted in 

a release in the ACL &#160;

of approximately $46 million presented as &#160;

an adjustment to the beginning balance &#160;

of retained earnings, net of 

tax effect. &#160;

Excluding &#160;

ASU &#160;

2022-02 &#160;

impact, &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

for &#160;

BPPR &#160;

increased by &#160;

$51 &#160;

million, &#160;

while the &#160;

ACL &#160;

for &#160;

Popular &#160;

U.S &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$15 

million &#160;

from &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022. The &#160;

increase in &#160;

BPPR &#160;

were mostly &#160;

driven by &#160;

higher reserves &#160;

for the &#160;

auto &#160;

and personal &#160;

loans 

portfolios attributable to &#160;

credit normalization, changes &#160;

in macroeconomic scenarios, &#160;

and loan growth, &#160;

partially offset by &#160;

changes in 

the &#160;

assignments &#160;

of &#160;

probability &#160;

weights &#160;

to &#160;

macroeconomic &#160;

scenarios, &#160;

as &#160;

previously &#160;

mentioned, &#160;

and &#160;

reductions &#160;

in &#160;

qualitative 

reserves. &#160;

In &#160;

PB, &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

decrease was &#160;

mostly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

implementation of &#160;

a &#160;

new &#160;

model for &#160;

the U.S. &#160;

commercial real &#160;

estate 

portfolio. The new model is based on more granular regional &#160;

information for the Corporation&#8217;s portfolio and accounted for $15 million 

of PB&#8217;s reduction in ACL. 

As &#160;

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

model &#160;

governance &#160;

procedures &#160;

a &#160;

new &#160;

model &#160;

was &#160;

implemented &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

U.S &#160;

commercial &#160;

real &#160;

estate 

segment. The new model &#160;

enhances techniques used to capture default &#160;

activity within the Corporation&#8217;s geographical footprint. &#160;

This 

enhancement is considered a change &#160;

in estimate. As part of &#160;

the implementation analysis management evaluated the &#160;

credit metrics 

of &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

risk &#160;

ratings, &#160;

delinquency &#160;

levels, &#160;

and &#160;

low &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

commercial &#160;

office &#160;

sector. &#160;

Qualitative &#160;

reserves 

continue to be maintained to address risks within &#160;

the U. S. commercial real estate segment.

The Corporation&#8217;s ratio of the allowance for &#160;

credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.09% on &#160;

September 30, 2023, compared to 

2.25% on December 31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

The ratio of the &#160;

allowance for credit losses &#160;

to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at &#160;

196.7%, compared to 

163.9% on December 31, 2022. 

The provision for &#160;

credit losses for &#160;

the period ended &#160;

September 30, 2023, &#160;

amounted to an &#160;

expense of $44 &#160;

million, compared to &#160;

an 

expense of $40 million for the period ended September 30, 2022. The provision expense related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the 

nine-month period ended &#160;

September 30, 2023 &#160;

was $126 million, &#160;

compared to an &#160;

expense of $35 &#160;

million for the &#160;

nine-month period 

ended &#160;

September &#160;

30,2022, &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

prior &#160;

period &#160;

included &#160;

reductions &#160;

in &#160;

reserves &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

post-pandemic &#160;

improvements &#160;

in &#160;

the 

macroeconomic outlook and lower NCOs. &#160;

part offset &#160;

by lower &#160;

commercial NCOs &#160;
