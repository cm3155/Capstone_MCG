 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

We, like &#160;

other financial institutions, &#160;

face risks &#160;

inherent to &#160;

our business, &#160;

financial condition, liquidity, &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

and &#160;

capital &#160;

position. &#160;

These &#160;

risks &#160;

could &#160;

cause &#160;

our &#160;

actual &#160;

results &#160;

to &#160;

differ &#160;

materially &#160;

from &#160;

our &#160;

historical &#160;

results &#160;

or &#160;

the &#160;

results 

contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. 

The risks described in &#160;

this report are not the &#160;

only risks we face. Additional &#160;

risks and uncertainties not currently &#160;

known by 

us &#160;

or &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

currently &#160;

deem &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

immaterial, &#160;

or &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

generally &#160;

applicable &#160;

to &#160;

all &#160;

financial &#160;

institutions, &#160;

may &#160;

also &#160;

materially 

adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position. 

ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS 

Weakness in &#160;

the economy, &#160;

particularly in &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

where a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of our &#160;

business is &#160;

concentrated, has 

adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely &#160;

impact us in the future. 

We have been, and will continue to be, impacted by global and local &#160;

economic and market conditions, including weakness 

in &#160;

the &#160;

economy, &#160;

disruptions &#160;

and &#160;

volatility &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

markets, &#160;

inflation, &#160;

changing &#160;

monetary &#160;

and &#160;

fiscal &#160;

policies, &#160;

geopolitical 

conflicts, consumer and changes &#160;

in business sentiment and &#160;

unemployment. A significant portion of &#160;

our business is concentrated in 

Puerto Rico, which &#160;

accounted for approximately 79% of &#160;

our assets and 84% &#160;

of our deposits &#160;

as of December 31, &#160;

2022 and 82% &#160;

of 

our &#160;

revenues &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

year &#160;

ended &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

As &#160;

a &#160;

result, &#160;

our &#160;

financial &#160;

condition &#160;

and &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

operations &#160;

are &#160;

highly 

dependent &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

general &#160;

trends &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

economy &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

conditions &#160;

affecting &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

consumers &#160;

and 

businesses. The &#160;

concentration of &#160;

our operations &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico exposes &#160;

us to &#160;

greater risks &#160;

than other &#160;

banking companies &#160;

with a 

wider geographic base. 

Puerto Rico &#160;

has faced significant &#160;

economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the &#160;

past, including a &#160;

severe recession that &#160;

began in 

2007 and &#160;

persisted for &#160;

over a &#160;

decade and &#160;

an acute &#160;

fiscal crisis &#160;

that led &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government &#160;

to file &#160;

for a &#160;

form &#160;

of federal 

bankruptcy protection &#160;

in 2017. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

fiscal and &#160;

economic challenges &#160;

have in &#160;

the past &#160;

adversely affected &#160;

our customers, 

resulting &#160;

in &#160;

higher &#160;

delinquencies, &#160;

charge-offs &#160;

and &#160;

increased &#160;

losses &#160;

for &#160;

us. &#160;

While &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy &#160;

has &#160;

been &#160;

gradually 

recovering &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

has &#160;

recently &#160;

emerged from &#160;

bankruptcy, &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

still &#160;

faces &#160;

economic &#160;

and &#160;

fiscal 

challenges and could face additional economic or fiscal challenges in the &#160;

future, including as a result of weakness or volatility in &#160;

the 

global economy &#160;

and financial &#160;

markets. A &#160;

weakening of &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

or other &#160;

adverse economic &#160;

conditions affecting 

Puerto Rico &#160;

consumers and &#160;

businesses could &#160;

result in &#160;

decreased demand &#160;

for our &#160;

products or &#160;

services, deterioration &#160;

in the &#160;

credit 

quality &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

customers, &#160;

higher delinquencies, &#160;

charge-offs &#160;

or &#160;

increased losses, &#160;

all &#160;

of &#160;

which &#160;

could adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. 

We are also exposed to risks related to the state of the local economies of the other markets in which we do business, such as New 

York &#160;

and Florida, &#160;

and to &#160;

the state &#160;

of the &#160;

global and &#160;

U.S. economy &#160;

and financial &#160;

markets. Global &#160;

financial markets &#160;

have recently 

experienced periods of &#160;

extraordinary disruption and volatility, &#160;

exacerbated by the &#160;

COVID-19 pandemic, the war &#160;

in Ukraine, supply-

chain disruptions, high levels of, and rapid increases in, inflation, &#160;

and increasing and high interest rates. Inflationary pressures have 

increased certain &#160;

of our &#160;

expenses (including &#160;

our personnel &#160;

expenses) and &#160;

adversely affected &#160;

consumer sentiment. &#160;

Central bank 

responses to inflationary pressures have led to &#160;

higher market interest rates and, in turn, &#160;

lower activity levels across U.S. and global 

financial markets. These circumstances have resulted in, and could continue to &#160;

result in, reductions in the value of &#160;

our investments. 

If &#160;

these &#160;

conditions &#160;

persist &#160;

or &#160;

worsen, &#160;

our &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

operations, financial &#160;

position &#160;

and &#160;

liquidity could &#160;

be &#160;

materially &#160;

and &#160;

adversely 

affected. 

Changes &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

credit &#160;

spreads &#160;

can &#160;

adversely &#160;

impact &#160;

our &#160;

financial &#160;

condition, &#160;

including &#160;

our &#160;

investment 

portfolio, &#160;

since &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

portion &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business involves &#160;

borrowing &#160;

and &#160;

lending &#160;

money, &#160;

and &#160;

investing in &#160;

financial 

instruments. 

Our business &#160;

and financial &#160;

performance are &#160;

impacted by &#160;

market interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

movements in &#160;

those rates. &#160;

Since a 

high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates, changes 

in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates, have had and could in the future have 

a material impact on our results &#160;

of operations and the values of our &#160;

assets and liabilities, including our investment portfolio. &#160;

Interest 

rates are &#160;

highly sensitive &#160;

to many &#160;

factors over &#160;

which we &#160;

have no &#160;

control and &#160;

which we &#160;

may not &#160;

be able &#160;

to anticipate &#160;

adequately, 

including general &#160;

economic conditions &#160;

and the &#160;

monetary and &#160;

tax policies &#160;

of various &#160;

governmental bodies, &#160;

particularly the &#160;

Federal 

Reserve Board. 

Increasing levels of inflation, driven &#160;

by pent-up demand and supply-chain disruptions caused &#160;

by the COVID-19 pandemic 

and the war in Ukraine, led the Federal Reserve Board to execute a series of sharp benchmark interest rate increases over the past 

year. &#160;

While the &#160;

pace at &#160;

which inflation &#160;

is increasing &#160;

has slowed &#160;

down in &#160;

recent months, &#160;

following a &#160;

mid-2022 peak, &#160;

the Federal 

Reserve Board has signaled &#160;

that it may increase &#160;

interest rates further to &#160;

continue to control and &#160;

bring down inflation. If &#160;

the interest 

rates we &#160;

pay on &#160;

our deposits and &#160;

other borrowings increase &#160;

at a &#160;

faster rate than &#160;

the interest rates &#160;

we receive on &#160;

loans and &#160;

other 

investments, our net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be adversely affected. Higher interest rates could also lead 

to fewer originations of commercial and residential real &#160;

estate loans, loss of deposits, a misalignment in the &#160;

pricing of short-term and 

long-term &#160;

borrowings, &#160;

less &#160;

liquidity &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

markets &#160;

and &#160;

higher &#160;

funding &#160;

costs. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

could 

negatively affect &#160;

the payment &#160;

performance on &#160;

loans linked &#160;

to variable &#160;

interest rates &#160;

to the &#160;

extent borrowers &#160;

are unable &#160;

to afford 

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

payments, which &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

higher &#160;

delinquencies. Additionally, &#160;

inflationary &#160;

pressure arising &#160;

from &#160;

increases in 

interest rates may also affect borrowers&#8217; financial condition and their ability to pay their debts when due. All of these outcomes could 

adversely affect our earnings, liquidity and capital levels. 

The &#160;

rapid &#160;

rise &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates &#160;

in &#160;

2022 &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

approximately &#160;

$2.5 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

unrealized &#160;

mark-to-market &#160;

losses &#160;

on 

available-for-sale securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In October 2022, we transferred U.S. Treasury securities with 

a fair value of approximately $6.5 billion (par value of &#160;

$7.4 billion), and with accumulated unrealized losses of $873 million, from our 

available-for-sale portfolio to our held-to-maturity portfolio to reduce the &#160;

impact of further increases in interest rates on &#160;

accumulated 

other comprehensive &#160;

income and &#160;

tangible capital. &#160;

However, &#160;

if interest &#160;

rates continue &#160;

to rise &#160;

rapidly or &#160;

for a &#160;

prolonged period, &#160;

we 

may accumulate significant additional mark-to-market losses &#160;

on other investment securities in &#160;

our available-for-sale portfolio, which 

may adversely affect our tangible capital and impact our &#160;

ability to return capital to our stockholders. 

We are &#160;

also subject &#160;

to risks &#160;

related to &#160;

the transition &#160;

away from &#160;

the London &#160;

Interbank Offered &#160;

Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) &#160;

upon the 

cessation in &#160;

the publication &#160;

of the &#160;

remaining principal &#160;

tenors of &#160;

U.S. dollar &#160;

LIBOR, which &#160;

is scheduled &#160;

for June &#160;

30, 2023. These 

risks were significantly reduced following the enactment by the U.S. &#160;

Congress of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act in the first 

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2022, &#160;

which &#160;

provides &#160;

a &#160;

framework &#160;

for &#160;

replacing &#160;

LIBOR &#160;

with &#160;

new &#160;

benchmark &#160;

rates &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

Secured &#160;

Overnight 

Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) &#160;

in loans that &#160;

do not have &#160;

effective alternate interest &#160;

rate provisions. However, &#160;

there is no &#160;

assurance that 

the new SOFR-based benchmarks will be similar to, &#160;

or produce the economic equivalent of, LIBOR, and the &#160;

transition to these new 

benchmark rates could result in operational, systems or &#160;

other practical challenges, litigation or &#160;

other adverse consequences. 

For a discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest rate sensitivity, please refer &#160;

in this Form 10-K. 

Fiscal challenges facing the U.S. government could negatively impact financial markets, which in turn could have 

an adverse effect on our financial position or &#160;

results of operations. 

In &#160;

January &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

outstanding &#160;

debt &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

reached &#160;

its &#160;

statutory &#160;

limit &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

Department 

commenced taking &#160;

extraordinary measures &#160;

to &#160;

prevent the &#160;

U.S. from &#160;

defaulting on &#160;

its obligations. &#160;

If Congress &#160;

does not &#160;

raise the 

debt &#160;

ceiling, &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

could &#160;

default &#160;

on &#160;

its &#160;

obligations, &#160;

including &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury &#160;

securities, &#160;

which &#160;

play &#160;

an &#160;

integral &#160;

role &#160;

in &#160;

financial 

markets. Many &#160;

of the &#160;

investment securities &#160;

held in &#160;

our portfolio &#160;

are issued &#160;

by the &#160;

U.S. government &#160;

and government &#160;

agencies. A 

U.S. &#160;

government &#160;

debt &#160;

default, &#160;

threatened &#160;

debt &#160;

default &#160;

or &#160;

downgrade &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

sovereign &#160;

credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

by &#160;

credit &#160;

rating 

agencies &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

adverse &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

market &#160;

volatility &#160;

and &#160;

illiquidity, &#160;

lead &#160;

to &#160;

further &#160;

increases &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates, 

heighten &#160;

operational &#160;

risks &#160;

relating &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

clearance &#160;

and &#160;

settlement &#160;

of &#160;

transactions, &#160;

and &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

deterioration &#160;

in 

economic conditions in &#160;

the U.S. and &#160;

worldwide. Even if &#160;

the U.S. does &#160;

not default, continued &#160;

uncertainty relating to &#160;

the debt ceiling 

could &#160;

result in &#160;

downgrades of &#160;

the U.S. &#160;

credit &#160;

rating, which &#160;

could adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

market conditions, &#160;

lead &#160;

to &#160;

further increases &#160;

in 

interest rates &#160;

and borrowing &#160;

costs or &#160;

necessitate significant &#160;

operational changes &#160;

among market &#160;

participants if &#160;

the liquidity &#160;

or fair 

value of U.S. Treasury and/or agency securities decreases. Further, the fair value, liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by, 

or other obligations of, agencies of the U.S. &#160;

government as well as municipal bonds could be &#160;

similarly adversely affected. 

BUSINESS RISKS 

Negative &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

condition &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

clients &#160;

have &#160;

adversely &#160;

impacted &#160;

us &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

past &#160;

and &#160;

may &#160;

adversely 

impact us in the future. 

&#160;

A significant portion of &#160;

our business involves lending money, &#160;

which exposes us to &#160;

credit risk and &#160;

risk of loss if &#160;

borrowers 

do &#160;

not &#160;

repay &#160;

their &#160;

loans, &#160;

leases, credit &#160;

cards &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

credit &#160;

obligations. &#160;

The &#160;

performance of &#160;

these &#160;

credit &#160;

portfolios &#160;

significantly 

affects our &#160;

financial condition &#160;

and results &#160;

of operations. &#160;

We have &#160;

in the &#160;

past been &#160;

adversely affected &#160;

by negative &#160;

changes in &#160;

the 

financial condition of our clients due to weakness in &#160;

the Puerto Rico and U.S. economy. If the current economic environment were to 

deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations, which may result in higher levels &#160;

of credit losses 

and reserves for credit losses. 

We are exposed to &#160;

increased credit risks and credit losses &#160;

to the extent our clients are &#160;

concentrated by industry segment 

or type of client.

Our credit risk and credit &#160;

losses can increase to the extent &#160;

our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in &#160;

the same 

or similar &#160;

activities or &#160;

in borrowers &#160;

who as &#160;

a group &#160;

may be &#160;

uniquely or &#160;

disproportionately affected &#160;

by certain &#160;

economic or &#160;

market 

conditions. We have significant &#160;

exposure to borrowers in certain &#160;

economic sectors, such as residential &#160;

and commercial real estate, 

hospitality and healthcare. Challenging economic or market conditions that affect &#160;

the industries or types of clients to &#160;

which we have 

significant exposure could result in higher credit &#160;

losses and adversely affect our financial condition &#160;

and results of operations. 

We also &#160;

have direct &#160;

lending and &#160;

investment exposure &#160;

to Puerto &#160;

Rico government &#160;

entities, which &#160;

have faced &#160;

significant 

fiscal challenges. &#160;

At December &#160;

31, 2022, &#160;

our exposure &#160;

to the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

government consisted &#160;

of $374 &#160;

million in &#160;

direct lending 

exposure to Puerto &#160;

Rico municipalities and &#160;

$251 million in &#160;

loans insured or &#160;

securities issued by &#160;

Puerto Rico governmental &#160;

entities 

but for &#160;

which the &#160;

principal source &#160;

of repayment &#160;

is non-governmental. &#160;

We also &#160;

have indirect &#160;

lending exposure &#160;

to the &#160;

Puerto Rico 

government in the &#160;

form of loans &#160;

to private borrowers &#160;

who are service &#160;

providers, lessors, suppliers &#160;

or have other &#160;

relationships with 

the Puerto Rico government. While the overall fiscal situation &#160;

of the Puerto Rico government has improved in recent years, &#160;

including 

as &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

government &#160;

and &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

having &#160;

restructured &#160;

their &#160;

debt &#160;

obligations, &#160;

some &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico 

government entities, including certain municipalities, still face significant &#160;

fiscal challenges. A deterioration in the fiscal situation of &#160;

the 

Puerto Rico &#160;

government and its &#160;

instrumentalities, and in &#160;

particular in the &#160;

fiscal situation &#160;

of the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

municipalities to &#160;

which 

we have direct lending exposure, could result in &#160;

higher credit losses and reserves for credit losses. For &#160;

a discussion of risks related 

to the Corporation&#8217;s credit exposure to the Puerto Rico &#160;

and USVI governments, see the Geographic and &#160;

loan and construction portfolios &#160;

have in 

the past resulted, and may in the future result, &#160;

in increased credit losses and harm our results &#160;

of operations.

As of &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022, approximately &#160;

56% of &#160;

our loan &#160;

portfolio consisted &#160;

of loans &#160;

secured by &#160;

real estate &#160;

collateral 

(comprised of 29% in commercial loans, 25% in residential &#160;

mortgage loans and 2% in construction loans). &#160;

The value of the collateral 

securing such loans is dependent upon economic conditions in the area in which the collateral is located. Weakness in the economy 

of some of the &#160;

markets we serve has in &#160;

the past resulted in significant &#160;

declines in the value of &#160;

the real properties securing our loan 

portfolio, leading to increased credit losses. If the value of &#160;

the real estate properties securing our loan portfolio declines again in the 

future, we may be &#160;

required to increase our &#160;

provisions for loan losses &#160;

and allowance for loan &#160;

losses. Any such increase could &#160;

have 

an adverse effect on &#160;

our financial condition and results of &#160;

operations. For more information on the credit &#160;

quality of our construction, 

commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk &#160;

section of the MD&#38;A included in this Form &#160;

10-K. 

We &#160;

are &#160;

exposed &#160;

to &#160;

credit &#160;

risk &#160;

from &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

that &#160;

have &#160;

been &#160;

sold &#160;

or &#160;

are &#160;

being &#160;

serviced &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

recourse 

arrangements. 

Popular &#160;

is &#160;

generally &#160;

at &#160;

risk &#160;

for &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loan &#160;

defaults &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

it &#160;

funds &#160;

a &#160;

loan &#160;

until &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

is &#160;

sold &#160;

or 

securitized into a &#160;

mortgage

-

backed security. &#160;

However, we &#160;

have retained part &#160;

of the credit &#160;

risk on sales &#160;

of mortgage loans &#160;

through 

recourse &#160;

arrangements, &#160;

and &#160;

we &#160;

also &#160;

service &#160;

certain &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

with &#160;

recourse. &#160;

At &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

we &#160;

were 

exposed to credit risk with respect to $0.6 billion in residential mortgage loans sold &#160;

or serviced subject to credit recourse provisions, 

consisting principally of loans associated with the Fannie Mae and &#160;

Freddie Mac programs. Pursuant to such recourse provisions, &#160;

we 

are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss in the event of a customer default. The 

maximum potential amount of future payments that &#160;

we would be required to make &#160;

under the recourse arrangements in the &#160;

event of 

nonperformance &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

borrowers &#160;

is &#160;

equivalent &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

total &#160;

outstanding balance &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

residential mortgage &#160;

loans &#160;

serviced &#160;

with 

recourse &#160;

and &#160;

interest, &#160;

if &#160;

applicable. In &#160;

the &#160;

event of &#160;

nonperformance by &#160;

the &#160;

borrower, &#160;

we &#160;

have rights &#160;

to &#160;

the underlying &#160;

collateral 

securing the &#160;

mortgage loan. &#160;

During 2022, &#160;

we repurchased &#160;

approximately $7 &#160;

million in &#160;

mortgage loans &#160;

subject to &#160;

credit recourse 

provisions. As &#160;

of December &#160;

31, 2022, &#160;

our liability &#160;

established &#160;

to cover &#160;

the estimated &#160;

credit loss &#160;

exposure related &#160;

to loans &#160;

sold or 

serviced with credit recourse amounted &#160;

to $7 million. We may suffer losses on these loans if the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of 

the property underlying &#160;

a defaulted mortgage &#160;

loan are less &#160;

than the outstanding &#160;

principal balance of &#160;

the loan plus &#160;

any uncollected 

interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of &#160;

the related property. 

Defective and repurchased

loans may harm our business and financial &#160;

condition.

In &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

sale &#160;

and &#160;

securitization &#160;

of &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans, &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

a &#160;

variety &#160;

of &#160;

customary 

representations &#160;

and &#160;

warranties regarding &#160;

Popular &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

loans being &#160;

sold &#160;

or securitized. &#160;

Our &#160;

obligations with &#160;

respect to &#160;

these 

representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life &#160;

of the loan, and they relate &#160;

to, among other things, compliance 

with &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

the &#160;

accuracy &#160;

of &#160;

information &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

documents &#160;

and &#160;

loan &#160;

file &#160;

and &#160;

the 

characteristics &#160;

and &#160;

enforceability of &#160;

the &#160;

loan. &#160;

A &#160;

loan &#160;

that &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

comply &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

secondary &#160;

market&#8217;s &#160;

requirements &#160;

may &#160;

take 

longer to &#160;

sell, impact &#160;

our ability &#160;

to securitize &#160;

the loans &#160;

or pledge &#160;

the loans &#160;

as collateral &#160;

for borrowings, &#160;

or be &#160;

unsalable or &#160;

salable 

only &#160;

at &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

discount. &#160;

Moreover, &#160;

if &#160;

any &#160;

such &#160;

loan &#160;

is &#160;

sold &#160;

before &#160;

we &#160;

detect &#160;

non-compliance, &#160;

we &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

obligated &#160;

to 

repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, &#160;

or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss. &#160;

We 

seek to &#160;

minimize repurchases and &#160;

losses from defective &#160;

loans by correcting &#160;

flaws, if possible, &#160;

and selling or &#160;

re-selling such loans. 

However, &#160;

if &#160;

we &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

suffer &#160;

significant &#160;

losses &#160;

from &#160;

defective &#160;

and &#160;

repurchased &#160;

loans, &#160;

our &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

financial 

condition could be materially impacted. 

If we are &#160;

unable to maintain &#160;

or grow our &#160;

deposits, we may &#160;

be subject to &#160;

paying higher funding costs &#160;

and our net &#160;

interest 

income may decrease. 

&#160;

We must maintain adequate liquidity and funding sources &#160;

to support our operations, comply with our financial &#160;

obligations, 

finance our transformation initiative, fund &#160;

planned capital distributions and meet &#160;

regulatory requirements. We rely &#160;

primarily on bank 

deposits &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

low cost &#160;

and stable &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

our &#160;

lending activities &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

operation of &#160;

our &#160;

business. &#160;

Therefore, &#160;

our 

funding costs &#160;

are largely &#160;

dependent on &#160;

our ability &#160;

to maintain &#160;

and grow &#160;

our deposits. &#160;

As our &#160;

competitors have &#160;

raised the &#160;

interest 

rates they pay on deposits, our &#160;

funding costs have increased, as we have &#160;

needed to increase the rates we pay &#160;

to our depositors to 

avoid losing &#160;

deposits. We &#160;

may also &#160;

need to &#160;

rely on &#160;

more expensive &#160;

sources of &#160;

funding if &#160;

deposits decrease. Rising &#160;

interest rates 

have &#160;

also &#160;

led &#160;

customers &#160;

to &#160;

move &#160;

their &#160;

funds &#160;

to &#160;

alternative &#160;

investments &#160;

that &#160;

pay &#160;

higher &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

we &#160;

have &#160;

a 

significant &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

deposits &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

government, &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and &#160;

municipalities &#160;

($15.2 &#160;

billion, &#160;

or 

approximately 25% of our &#160;

total deposits, as of &#160;

December 31, 2022), and &#160;

the amount of these &#160;

deposits may fluctuate depending on 

the financial &#160;

condition and &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

these entities, &#160;

as well &#160;

as &#160;

on our &#160;

ability to &#160;

maintain these &#160;

customer relationships. &#160;

If we &#160;

are 

unable to &#160;

maintain or &#160;

grow our &#160;

deposits for &#160;

any &#160;

reason, we &#160;

may be &#160;

subject to &#160;

paying higher &#160;

funding costs &#160;

and &#160;

our &#160;

net interest 

income may decrease. 

OPERATIONAL RISKS 

We &#160;

and our &#160;

third-party providers &#160;

have been, &#160;

and expect &#160;

in the &#160;

future to &#160;

continue to &#160;

be, subject &#160;

to cyber &#160;

attacks, which 

could cause substantial harm and have an adverse &#160;

effect on our business and results of operations. 

Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part 

because &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

proliferation &#160;

of &#160;

new &#160;

technologies, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

Internet &#160;

and &#160;

mobile &#160;

banking &#160;

to &#160;

conduct &#160;

instant &#160;

financial &#160;

transactions 

anywhere globally, &#160;

growing geo-political threats, &#160;

such as the &#160;

ongoing Russian conflict &#160;

in Ukraine, and &#160;

the increased sophistication 

and activities of organized crime, hackers, &#160;

terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In &#160;

the ordinary course of business, 

we rely on &#160;

electronic communications and &#160;

information systems to &#160;

conduct our operations &#160;

and to transmit &#160;

and store sensitive &#160;

data. 

We employ &#160;

a layered &#160;

defensive approach &#160;

that employs &#160;

people, processes &#160;

and technology &#160;

to manage &#160;

and maintain &#160;

cybersecurity 

controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity &#160;

and 

identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to 

protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times, especially as 

the threats from cyber-attacks &#160;

are continuous and severe. The &#160;

risk of a &#160;

security breach due to &#160;

a cyber attack could &#160;

increase in the 

future as &#160;

we continue &#160;

to expand &#160;

our mobile &#160;

banking and &#160;

other internet &#160;

based product &#160;

offerings, the &#160;

use &#160;

of the &#160;

cloud for &#160;

system 

development and hosting and internal use of &#160;

internet-based products and applications. 

We &#160;

continue to &#160;

detect and &#160;

identify attacks &#160;

that are &#160;

becoming more &#160;

sophisticated and &#160;

increasing in &#160;

volume, as &#160;

well as 

attackers that &#160;

respond rapidly to &#160;

changes in &#160;

defensive countermeasures. The &#160;

most significant cyber-attack &#160;

risks that we &#160;

may face 

are e-fraud, denial-of-service (DDoS), ransomware, &#160;

computer intrusion and the &#160;

exploitation of software zero-day &#160;

vulnerabilities that 

might result &#160;

in disruption &#160;

of services &#160;

and in &#160;

the exposure &#160;

or loss &#160;

of customer &#160;

or proprietary &#160;

data. Loss &#160;

from e-fraud &#160;

occurs when 

cybercriminals compromise &#160;

our systems &#160;

or the &#160;

systems of &#160;

our customers &#160;

and extract &#160;

funds from &#160;

customer&#8217;s credit &#160;

cards or &#160;

bank 

accounts, including through &#160;

brute force, password &#160;

spraying and credential &#160;

stuffing attacks directed &#160;

at gaining unauthorized &#160;

access 

to &#160;

individual &#160;

accounts. &#160;

Denial-of-service &#160;

attacks &#160;

intentionally &#160;

disrupt &#160;

the &#160;

ability &#160;

of &#160;

legitimate &#160;

users, &#160;

including &#160;

customers &#160;

and 

employees, &#160;

to &#160;

access &#160;

networks, &#160;

websites &#160;

and &#160;

online &#160;

resources. &#160;

Computer &#160;

intrusion &#160;

attempts &#160;

either &#160;

direct &#160;

or &#160;

through &#160;

social 

engineering, supply chain compromise, email, text or voice messages, including &#160;

using brand impersonation (regularly referred to as 

phishing, vishing and smishing), might &#160;

result in the compromise &#160;

of sensitive customer data, &#160;

such as account numbers, &#160;

credit cards 

and social security numbers, and could present &#160;

significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs &#160;

to Popular if successful. 

We are &#160;

the target of &#160;

phishing, smishing and vishing &#160;

attacks targeting both &#160;

our customers and &#160;

employees through brand, 

email, text and &#160;

voicemail impersonation, that &#160;

have compromised the &#160;

email accounts of &#160;

certain of our &#160;

customers and employees &#160;

or 

have &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

our &#160;

customers &#160;

being &#160;

deceived &#160;

into &#160;

revealing &#160;

their &#160;

sensitive &#160;

information &#160;

to &#160;

threat &#160;

actors. &#160;

There &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

no 

assurances that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future. Our customer-facing platforms 

are &#160;

also &#160;

routinely &#160;

attacked &#160;

by &#160;

threat &#160;

actors &#160;

aiming &#160;

to &#160;

gain &#160;

unauthorized &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

our &#160;

clients&#8217; &#160;

accounts. &#160;

Popular &#160;

has &#160;

recently 

implemented certain defensive measures in response to &#160;

brute force attacks on one &#160;

of our platforms which &#160;

resulted in certain of our 

customers &#160;

log-in &#160;

credentials &#160;

and &#160;

information &#160;

being &#160;

exposed. &#160;

As &#160;

a &#160;

result, &#160;

Popular &#160;

notified, &#160;

as &#160;

required &#160;

or &#160;

otherwise &#160;

deemed 

appropriate, customers &#160;

identified as &#160;

affected by &#160;

the incident. &#160;

We have &#160;

to date &#160;

not experienced &#160;

material losses &#160;

in connection &#160;

with 

these &#160;

attacks. &#160;

Cyber-security &#160;

risks &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

been &#160;

recently &#160;

exacerbated &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

discovery &#160;

of &#160;

zero-day &#160;

vulnerabilities &#160;

in &#160;

widely 

distributed &#160;

third &#160;

party &#160;

software, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

vulnerability &#160;

identified &#160;

in &#160;

December &#160;

2021 &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Apache &#160;

log4j, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

affect 

Popular&#8217;s or any of its service provider&#8217;s &#160;

systems. 

The &#160;

increased &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

remote &#160;

access &#160;

and &#160;

third-party &#160;

video &#160;

conferencing &#160;

solutions &#160;

to &#160;

enable &#160;

work-from-home 

arrangements for &#160;

employees &#160;

and &#160;

facilitating the &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

digital channels &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

customers, &#160;

has &#160;

increased &#160;

our &#160;

exposure to &#160;

cyber 

attacks. In &#160;

addition, a &#160;

third party &#160;

could misappropriate &#160;

confidential information &#160;

obtained by &#160;

intercepting signals &#160;

or communications 

from mobile devices used by Popular&#8217;s customers or employees. Recent events, including the Russian conflict in Ukraine, have also 

illustrated &#160;

increased geo-political &#160;

factors &#160;

and the &#160;

risks related &#160;

to &#160;

supply-chain compromises &#160;

and &#160;

de-stabilizing activities &#160;

linked to 

nation-state sponsored activity as an increasing trend &#160;

to monitor actively. &#160;

Risks and exposures related to cyber security &#160;

attacks are 

expected to &#160;

remain high for &#160;

the foreseeable future &#160;

due to &#160;

the rapidly evolving &#160;

nature and sophistication &#160;

of these &#160;

threats, including 

the rise in the use of cyber-attacks as geopolitical weapons. Although we are &#160;

regularly targeted by unauthorized threat-actor activity, 

we have not, to date, experienced any material &#160;

losses as a result of any cyber-attacks. &#160;

A material compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could &#160;

have serious negative consequences for us, 

including &#160;

significant &#160;

disruption &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

those &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

clients, &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

counterparties, &#160;

misappropriation &#160;

of 

confidential information &#160;

of us &#160;

or that &#160;

of our &#160;

clients, customers, &#160;

counterparties or &#160;

employees, or &#160;

damage to &#160;

computers or &#160;

systems 

used &#160;

by &#160;

us &#160;

or &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

clients, &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

counterparties, &#160;

and &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

violations &#160;

of &#160;

applicable &#160;

privacy &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

laws, 

financial loss &#160;

to us &#160;

or to &#160;

our customers, &#160;

loss of &#160;

confidence in &#160;

our security &#160;

measures, customer &#160;

dissatisfaction, significant litigation 

exposure and harm to &#160;

our reputation, all of &#160;

which could have a &#160;

material adverse effect &#160;

on us. For example, &#160;

if personal, non-public, 

confidential &#160;

or &#160;

proprietary &#160;

information &#160;

in &#160;

our &#160;

possession &#160;

were &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

mishandled, &#160;

misused &#160;

or &#160;

stolen, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

suffer &#160;

significant 

regulatory consequences, reputational damage &#160;

and financial loss. &#160;

Such mishandling, misuse &#160;

or misappropriation could include, &#160;

for 

example, if such information &#160;

were provided to parties &#160;

who are not permitted &#160;

to have the &#160;

information, either by fault &#160;

of our systems, 

by our employees &#160;

or counterparties, or &#160;

where such information &#160;

is intercepted or &#160;

otherwise inappropriately taken by &#160;

our employees 

or third parties. 

The &#160;

extent &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

particular &#160;

cyber &#160;

attack &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

steps &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

may &#160;

need &#160;

to &#160;

take &#160;

to &#160;

investigate the &#160;

attack &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be 

immediately &#160;

clear, &#160;

and &#160;

it &#160;

may &#160;

take &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

time &#160;

before &#160;

such &#160;

an &#160;

investigation &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

completed. &#160;

While &#160;

such &#160;

an 

investigation is ongoing, Popular may not necessarily know the full &#160;

extent of the harm caused by the cyber &#160;

attack, and that damage 

may continue to spread. &#160;

These factors may inhibit &#160;

our ability to provide &#160;

rapid, full and reliable &#160;

information about the cyber &#160;

attack to 

our clients, &#160;

customers, counterparties and &#160;

regulators, as well &#160;

as the public. &#160;

Moreover, potential &#160;

new regulations may &#160;

require us to 

disclose information about &#160;

a cybersecurity event before &#160;

it has been &#160;

resolved or fully &#160;

investigated. Furthermore, it may &#160;

not be clear 

how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or 

compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Cyber attacks could cause interruptions in our operations and result in the 

incurrence &#160;

of &#160;

significant &#160;

costs, &#160;

including those &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

forensic analysis &#160;

and &#160;

legal counsel, &#160;

each of &#160;

which may &#160;

be &#160;

required to 

ascertain the extent &#160;

of any potential &#160;

harm to our &#160;

customers, or employees, or &#160;

damage to our information &#160;

systems and any &#160;

legal or 

regulatory obligations that &#160;

may result therefrom. &#160;

Any cyber incidents &#160;

could also result &#160;

in, among other &#160;

things, increased regulatory 

scrutiny &#160;

and adverse &#160;

regulatory or &#160;

civil &#160;

litigation consequences. &#160;

For a &#160;

discussion of &#160;

the guidance &#160;

and rules &#160;

that federal &#160;

banking 

regulators &#160;

have &#160;

released &#160;

or &#160;

proposed &#160;

regarding &#160;

cybersecurity &#160;

and &#160;

cyber &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

standards, &#160;

see &#160;

&#8220;Regulation &#160;

and 

Supervision&#8221; in &#160;

Part &#160;

I, &#160;

Item &#160;

1 &#8212; &#160;

Business, &#160;

included in &#160;

the &#160;

Form 10-K &#160;

for the &#160;

year &#160;

ended December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022. Any &#160;

or &#160;

all &#160;

of &#160;

the 

foregoing factors could further increase the impact &#160;

of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences &#160;

of a cyber attack. &#160;

We also &#160;

rely on &#160;

third parties &#160;

for the &#160;

performance of &#160;

a significant &#160;

portion of &#160;

our information &#160;

technology functions and &#160;

the 

provision of information security, &#160;

technology and business process services. As a result, a &#160;

successful compromise or circumvention 

of &#160;

the security &#160;

of &#160;

the systems &#160;

of these &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers could &#160;

have serious &#160;

negative consequences &#160;

for us, &#160;

including 

misappropriation of &#160;

confidential information &#160;

of us &#160;

or that &#160;

of our &#160;

clients, customers, &#160;

counterparties or &#160;

employees, or &#160;

other negative 

implications identified above with respect to a cyber-attack on our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Cyber 

attacks at third-party service &#160;

providers are also becoming &#160;

increasingly common, and, as &#160;

a result, cybersecurity risks &#160;

relating to our 

vendors have &#160;

increased. The most &#160;

important of &#160;

these third-party service &#160;

providers for us &#160;

is Evertec, and &#160;

certain risks &#160;

particular to 

Evertec are &#160;

discussed under &#160;

&#8220;Operational Risks &#160;

&#8212; We &#160;

are subject &#160;

to additional &#160;

risks relating &#160;

to the &#160;

Evertec Business &#160;

Acquisition 

Transaction&#8221;. During 2021, we &#160;

determined that, as a result &#160;

of the widely reported breach of &#160;

Accellion, Inc.&#8217;s File Transfer &#160;

Appliance 

tool, which &#160;

was being &#160;

used at &#160;

the time &#160;

of such &#160;

breach by &#160;

a U.S.-based &#160;

third-party advisory &#160;

services vendor &#160;

of Popular, &#160;

personal 

information &#160;

of &#160;

certain &#160;

Popular &#160;

customers &#160;

was &#160;

compromised. &#160;

As &#160;

a &#160;

result, &#160;

Popular &#160;

notified, &#160;

as &#160;

required &#160;

or &#160;

otherwise &#160;

deemed 

appropriate, customers identified as affected by the incident. Although we are not aware of fraudulent activity &#160;

in connection with this 

incident, &#160;

Popular&#8217;s &#160;

networks &#160;

and &#160;

systems &#160;

were &#160;

not &#160;

impacted, &#160;

and &#160;

our &#160;

third-party &#160;

service &#160;

provider &#160;

agreed &#160;

to &#160;

cover &#160;

external 

remediation costs associated with the incident. A compromise of the personal information of our &#160;

customers maintained by third party 

vendors &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

significant &#160;

regulatory &#160;

consequences, &#160;

reputational &#160;

damage &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

loss &#160;

to &#160;

us. &#160;

The &#160;

success &#160;

of &#160;

our 

business depends &#160;

in part &#160;

on the &#160;

continuing ability &#160;

of these &#160;

(and other) &#160;

third parties &#160;

to perform &#160;

these functions &#160;

and services &#160;

in a 

timely &#160;

and &#160;

satisfactory &#160;

manner, &#160;

which &#160;

performance &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

disrupted &#160;

or &#160;

otherwise &#160;

adversely &#160;

affected &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

failures &#160;

or &#160;

other 

information security &#160;

events originating at &#160;

the third &#160;

parties or at &#160;

the third parties&#8217; &#160;

suppliers or vendors &#160;

(so-called &#8220;fourth party &#160;

risk&#8221;). 

We &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

able &#160;

to &#160;

effectively &#160;

directly &#160;

monitor &#160;

or &#160;

mitigate &#160;

fourth-party &#160;

risk, &#160;

in &#160;

particular &#160;

as &#160;

it &#160;

relates &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

common 

suppliers &#160;

or &#160;

vendors &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

third &#160;

parties that &#160;

perform &#160;

functions &#160;

and &#160;

services &#160;

for &#160;

us. &#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

discussion of &#160;

the &#160;

risks &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

our 

dependence &#160;

on &#160;

third &#160;

parties, &#160;

including &#160;

Evertec, &#160;

see &#160;

&#8220;We &#160;

rely &#160;

on &#160;

other &#160;

companies &#160;

to &#160;

provide &#160;

key &#160;

components &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business 

infrastructure, including certain of our core &#160;

financial transaction processing and information technology and &#160;

security services, which 

exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material &#160;

adverse effect on us&#8221; in the Operational Risks section of Item 

1A in this Form 10-K. 

As &#160;

cyber &#160;

threats &#160;

continue &#160;

to &#160;

evolve, &#160;

we &#160;

expect &#160;

to &#160;

expend &#160;

significant &#160;

additional &#160;

resources &#160;

to &#160;

continue &#160;

to &#160;

modify &#160;

or 

enhance our &#160;

layers of &#160;

defense or &#160;

to investigate &#160;

and remediate &#160;

additional information &#160;

security vulnerabilities &#160;

or incidents. &#160;

System 

enhancements and &#160;

updates also &#160;

create risks &#160;

associated with &#160;

implementing new &#160;

systems and &#160;

integrating them &#160;

with existing &#160;

ones, 

including risks associated with supply chain compromises &#160;

and the software development lifecycle of the &#160;

systems used by us and our 

service providers. Due &#160;

to the complexity &#160;

and interconnectedness of information &#160;

technology systems, the &#160;

process of enhancing &#160;

our 

layers &#160;

of &#160;

defense can &#160;

itself &#160;

create &#160;

a &#160;

risk &#160;

of &#160;

systems &#160;

disruptions &#160;

and &#160;

security &#160;

issues. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

addressing &#160;

certain &#160;

information 

security vulnerabilities, such as &#160;

hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect &#160;

the performance of our &#160;

information technology systems. 

The ability of our &#160;

hardware and software providers to deliver &#160;

patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities &#160;

in a timely manner &#160;

can 

introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability &#160;

is being actively exploited by threat &#160;

actors. Moreover, our ability &#160;

to timely 

mitigate &#160;

vulnerabilities &#160;

and &#160;

manage &#160;

such &#160;

risks, &#160;

given &#160;

the &#160;

rise &#160;

in &#160;

number &#160;

of &#160;

required &#160;

patches &#160;

and &#160;

third-party &#160;

software, &#160;

including 

&#8220;zero-day &#160;

vulnerabilities&#8221;, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

obsolescence &#160;

in &#160;

some &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

hardware &#160;

and &#160;

software, &#160;

may &#160;

impact &#160;

our &#160;

day-to-day 

operations, the availability of our systems and &#160;

delay the deployment of technology enhancements &#160;

and innovation. &#160;

If Popular&#8217;s operational systems, &#160;

or those of &#160;

external parties on which &#160;

Popular&#8217;s businesses depend, are &#160;

unable to meet 

the requirements of our &#160;

businesses and operations or bank &#160;

regulatory standards, or if they &#160;

fail, have other significant &#160;

shortcomings 

or are impacted by cyber attacks, Popular could be &#160;

materially and adversely affected. 

Unforeseen or &#160;

catastrophic events, &#160;

including &#160;

extreme weather &#160;

events and &#160;

other natural &#160;

disasters, man-made &#160;

disasters, 

acts of violence or &#160;

war, or the &#160;

emergence of pandemics or epidemics, could &#160;

cause a disruption in our &#160;

operations or other 

consequences that could have a material adverse &#160;

effect on our financial condition and results &#160;

of operations. 

A &#160;

significant &#160;

portion &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

operations &#160;

are &#160;

located &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

Caribbean &#160;

and &#160;

Florida, &#160;

a &#160;

region &#160;

susceptible &#160;

to &#160;

hurricanes, 

earthquakes and other &#160;

similar events. In &#160;

2017, Puerto Rico, &#160;

USVI and BVI &#160;

were severely impacted &#160;

by Hurricanes Irma &#160;

and Mar&#237;a, 

which resulted in significant disruption to our operations and adversely affected &#160;

our clients in these markets, and in 2022, Hurricane 

Fiona impacted the &#160;

southwest area of &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

adversely affecting our &#160;

customers in &#160;

that region. Other &#160;

types of &#160;

unforeseen or 

catastrophic events, including &#160;

pandemics, epidemics, man-made &#160;

disasters, or acts &#160;

of violence or &#160;

war, or &#160;

the fear that &#160;

such events 

could &#160;

occur, &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

adversely &#160;

impact &#160;

our &#160;

operations &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

results. &#160;

For &#160;

example, &#160;

in &#160;

2020, &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

pandemic 

severely &#160;

impacted &#160;

global &#160;

health, &#160;

financial &#160;

markets, &#160;

consumer &#160;

spending &#160;

and &#160;

global &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

and &#160;

caused &#160;

significant 

disruption &#160;

to &#160;

businesses worldwide, &#160;

including &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

those &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

customers, service &#160;

providers &#160;

and &#160;

suppliers. &#160;

Future 

unforeseen &#160;

or &#160;

catastrophic &#160;

events, &#160;

including &#160;

the &#160;

appearance &#160;

of &#160;

new &#160;

strains &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

COVID-19 &#160;

virus, &#160;

and &#160;

actions &#160;

taken &#160;

by 

governmental &#160;

authorities and &#160;

other &#160;

third &#160;

parties in &#160;

response to &#160;

such &#160;

events, &#160;

could &#160;

again &#160;

adversely affect &#160;

our &#160;

operations, cause 

economic &#160;

and &#160;

market disruption, &#160;

adversely &#160;

impact the &#160;

ability &#160;

of &#160;

borrowers to &#160;

timely &#160;

repay their &#160;

loans, &#160;

or &#160;

affect &#160;

the value &#160;

of &#160;

any 

collateral held by us, any of &#160;

which could have a material adverse effect &#160;

on our business, financial condition or results &#160;

of operations. 

The frequency, &#160;

severity and &#160;

impact of &#160;

future unforeseen &#160;

or catastrophic &#160;

events is &#160;

difficult to &#160;

predict. While &#160;

we maintain &#160;

insurance 

against &#160;

natural &#160;

disasters &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

unforeseen &#160;

events, &#160;

including &#160;

coverage &#160;

for &#160;

business &#160;

interruption, &#160;

the &#160;

insurance &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be 

sufficient to cover all &#160;

of the damage from any such &#160;

event, and there is no insurance &#160;

against the disruption that a catastrophic event 

could produce to the markets that we serve and &#160;

the potential negative impact to economic &#160;

activity. 

Climate change could have a material adverse &#160;

impact on our business operations and that &#160;

of our clients and customers.

Our business and &#160;

the activities and &#160;

operations of our &#160;

clients and customers &#160;

may be disrupted &#160;

by global climate &#160;

change. 

Potential physical risks &#160;

from climate change &#160;

include the increase &#160;

in the &#160;

frequency and severity &#160;

of weather &#160;

events, such as &#160;

storms 

and &#160;

hurricanes, &#160;

and &#160;

long-term &#160;

shifts &#160;

in &#160;

climate &#160;

patterns, such &#160;

as &#160;

sustained &#160;

higher &#160;

and &#160;

lower &#160;

temperatures, &#160;

sea &#160;

level &#160;

rise, &#160;

heat 

waves and &#160;

droughts, among &#160;

others. Additionally, &#160;

the impact &#160;

of climate &#160;

change in &#160;

the markets &#160;

that we &#160;

operate and &#160;

in other &#160;

global 

markets may &#160;

have the &#160;

effect of &#160;

increasing the &#160;

costs or &#160;

reducing the &#160;

availability of &#160;

insurance needed &#160;

for our &#160;

business operations. 

Climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a low-carbon economy. &#160;

These transition risks may include 

changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, technology, consumer sentiment and preferences, and market demands that seek to 

mitigate the &#160;

effects &#160;

of climate &#160;

change. Changes &#160;

in the &#160;

legal &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

landscape may &#160;

additionally increase &#160;

our compliance 

costs. &#160;

These &#160;

climate &#160;

driven &#160;

changes &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

material &#160;

adverse &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

asset &#160;

values &#160;

and &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

financial 

performance and those of our clients and customers. 

We &#160;

rely &#160;

on &#160;

other &#160;

companies &#160;

to &#160;

provide &#160;

key &#160;

components &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

infrastructure, &#160;

including &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

core 

financial &#160;

transaction &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

information &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

security &#160;

services, &#160;

which &#160;

exposes &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

number &#160;

of 

operational risks that could have a material &#160;

adverse effect on us. 

Third parties provide key components of our business operations, such &#160;

as data processing, information security, recording 

and monitoring transactions, &#160;

online banking interfaces and &#160;

services, Internet connections and &#160;

network access. The most &#160;

important 

of these third-party &#160;

service providers for &#160;

us is Evertec. &#160;

Although the Evertec &#160;

Business Acquisition Transaction &#160;

narrowed the scope 

of &#160;

services &#160;

which &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

dependent &#160;

on &#160;

Evertec to &#160;

obtain &#160;

and &#160;

released &#160;

us &#160;

from &#160;

exclusivity &#160;

restrictions &#160;

that &#160;

limited &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to 

engage other third-party &#160;

providers of financial &#160;

technology services, we &#160;

are still dependent &#160;

on Evertec for &#160;

the provision of &#160;

essential 

services &#160;

to &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

including &#160;

certain &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

core &#160;

financial &#160;

transaction &#160;

processing &#160;

and &#160;

information &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

security 

services. As &#160;

a &#160;

result, we &#160;

are &#160;

particularly exposed &#160;

to &#160;

the operational &#160;

risks &#160;

of Evertec, &#160;

including those &#160;

relating to &#160;

a &#160;

breakdown or 

failure of Evertec&#8217;s systems or internal controls environment. Over the course of &#160;

our relationship with Evertec, we have experienced 

interruptions &#160;

and &#160;

delays &#160;

in &#160;

key &#160;

services &#160;

provided &#160;

by &#160;

which &#160;

have &#160;

in &#160;

cases &#160;

led &#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

discussion &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Evertec &#160;

Business &#160;

Acquisition &#160;

Transaction, &#160;

Year &#160;

Significant Events 

section of the MD&#38;A. &#160;

&#160;

While we &#160;

select third-party vendors &#160;

carefully and &#160;

have increased our &#160;

oversight of these &#160;

relationships, we do &#160;

not control 

the &#160;

actions &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

vendors. &#160;

Any &#160;

problems &#160;

caused &#160;

by &#160;

these &#160;

vendors, &#160;

including &#160;

those &#160;

resulting &#160;

from &#160;

disruptions &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

services 

provided, vulnerabilities in or breaches &#160;

of the vendor&#8217;s systems, failure of &#160;

the vendor to handle &#160;

current or higher volumes, &#160;

failure of 

the vendor &#160;

to provide services &#160;

for any &#160;

reason or &#160;

poor performance of &#160;

services, or &#160;

failure of &#160;

the vendor to &#160;

notify us of &#160;

a reportable 

event in a timely manner, &#160;

could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to &#160;

our customers and otherwise conduct 

our &#160;

business, &#160;

result in &#160;

potential liability &#160;

to &#160;

clients &#160;

and customers, &#160;

result in &#160;

the &#160;

imposition of &#160;

fines, &#160;

penalties or &#160;

judgments by &#160;

our 

regulators or &#160;

harm to &#160;

our reputation, &#160;

any of &#160;

which could &#160;

materially and &#160;

adversely affect &#160;

us. The &#160;

inability of &#160;

our third-party &#160;

service 

providers to timely address &#160;

evolving cybersecurity threats may further &#160;

exacerbate these risks. Financial or &#160;

operational difficulties of 

a third-party vendor could also &#160;

hurt our operations if those &#160;

difficulties interfere with the vendor&#8217;s ability to &#160;

serve us. Replacing these 

third-party vendors, when possible, could also create significant &#160;

delay and expense. Accordingly, &#160;

the use of third parties &#160;

creates an 

unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. 

The transition to new financial services technology providers, and the replacement of services currently provided &#160;

to us by 

Evertec, will be lengthy and complex. 

Switching from &#160;

one vendor &#160;

of core &#160;

bank processing &#160;

and related &#160;

technology and &#160;

security services &#160;

to &#160;

one &#160;

or more &#160;

new 

vendors &#160;

is &#160;

a &#160;

complex &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

carries &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

risks. &#160;

The &#160;

implementation &#160;

cycle &#160;

for &#160;

such &#160;

a &#160;

transition &#160;

can &#160;

be 

lengthy and require significant financial and &#160;

management resources from us. Such &#160;

a transition can also expose us, &#160;

and our clients, 

to &#160;

increased &#160;

costs &#160;

(including &#160;

conversion &#160;

costs), &#160;

business &#160;

disruption, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

operational &#160;

and &#160;

cybersecurity &#160;

risks. &#160;

Upon &#160;

the 

transition of all or &#160;

a portion of existing services &#160;

provided by Evertec to a &#160;

new financial services technology provider, &#160;

either (i) at the 

end of the term of the Second Amended and Restated &#160;

Master Services Agreement (the &#8220;MSA&#8221;) and related &#160;

agreements or (ii) earlier 

upon the &#160;

termination of any &#160;

service for &#160;

convenience under the &#160;

MSA, these transition &#160;

risks could result &#160;

in an &#160;

adverse effect &#160;

on our 

business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Evertec &#160;

has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to &#160;

us in 

connection with &#160;

the termination of &#160;

the MSA, &#160;

we are &#160;

ultimately dependent on &#160;

their ability &#160;

to provide &#160;

those services &#160;

in a &#160;

responsive 

and competent manner. Furthermore, we &#160;

may require transition assistance from Evertec beyond the term of &#160;

the MSA, delaying and 

lengthening any transition process away from Evertec &#160;

while increasing related costs. 

&#160;

Under the &#160;

MSA, we &#160;

are able &#160;

to terminate &#160;

services for &#160;

convenience with &#160;

180 days&#8217; &#160;

prior notice. &#160;

We expect &#160;

to exercise 

during the &#160;

term of &#160;

the MSA &#160;

the right &#160;

to terminate &#160;

certain services &#160;

for convenience &#160;

and to &#160;

transition such &#160;

services to &#160;

other service 

providers prior to the expiration &#160;

of the MSA, subject to &#160;

complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in &#160;

the MSA and certain 

other conditions. In &#160;

practice, in order &#160;

to switch &#160;

to a &#160;

new provider for &#160;

a particular &#160;

service, we will &#160;

have to commence &#160;

procuring and 

working on &#160;

a transition &#160;

process for &#160;

such service &#160;

significantly in &#160;

advance of &#160;

its termination &#160;

and, in &#160;

any case, &#160;

much earlier &#160;

than the 

automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of &#160;

the MSA, and such process may extend beyond the current &#160;

term of the MSA. 

Furthermore, if &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

unsuccessful or &#160;

decide not &#160;

to &#160;

complete &#160;

the transition &#160;

after &#160;

expending significant &#160;

funds &#160;

and &#160;

management 

resources, it could also result in an adverse &#160;

effect on our business, financial condition and results of &#160;

operations. 

We are subject to additional risks relating to the &#160;

Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction. 

There are numerous additional risks and uncertainties &#160;

associated with the Evertec Business Acquisition &#160;

Transaction, including: 

&#9679;

&#160;

unforeseen events may materially diminish the expected &#160;

benefits of the Evertec Business Acquisition Transaction; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

we have devoted, and will continue to, devote significant attention and resources to post closing implementation efforts, which 

will involve a significant degree of technological complexity &#160;

and reliance on Evertec and other third parties; 

&#9679;

&#160;

we may be &#160;

unable to retain the &#160;

employees and third-party contractors hired or &#160;

engaged by us in connection &#160;

with the Evertec 

Business Acquisition

Transaction and who are &#160;

necessary to operate and integrate the &#160;

assets acquired as part of &#160;

the Evertec 

Business Acquisition

Transaction (the &#8220;Acquired Assets&#8221;); &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

we may &#160;

be subject &#160;

to incremental &#160;

operational and &#160;

security risks &#160;

arising from &#160;

the transfer &#160;

of the &#160;

Acquired Assets &#160;

to BPPR, 

including those risks arising from, among &#160;

other things, the activities required to &#160;

execute network segmentation, the possibility 

of misconfiguration of access or security services during &#160;

the transition period and during the implementation &#160;

of new processes 

or &#160;

security &#160;

controls, &#160;

the &#160;

possibility &#160;

of &#160;

mismanagement &#160;

of &#160;

security &#160;

services &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

transition &#160;

phase, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

need &#160;

to 

develop a robust internal control framework; 

&#9679;

&#160;

the anticipated benefits of the Evertec Business Acquisition

Transaction could be limited if Evertec fails to &#160;

deliver to BPPR, in 

a timely manner and in a manner that meets BPPR&#8217;s requirements, the core &#160;

application programming interfaces (&#8220;Core APIs&#8221;) 

that Evertec has committed &#160;

to develop in &#160;

order for BPPR to &#160;

connect future enhancements to the &#160;

Acquired Assets to existing 

Evertec core applications; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

we may be exposed to heightened business risks &#160;

as a result of the extension until &#160;

2035 of BPPR&#8217;s exclusivity with Evertec in 

connection with &#160;

its merchant &#160;

acquiring business, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the extension &#160;

until 2030 &#160;

of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commitment with respect &#160;

to 

the ATH Network, in light of the pace of technology changes and competition &#160;

in the payments industry; and &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Evertec&#8217;s strategy and investments after the &#160;

closing of the Evertec Business &#160;

Acquisition

Transaction may be refocused away 

from Popular towards other strategic initiatives. 

Any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a &#160;

material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, financial &#160;

condition, 

and/or stock price. 

LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 

Our &#160;

businesses &#160;

are &#160;

highly &#160;

regulated, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations &#160;

that &#160;

apply &#160;

to &#160;

us &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

significant &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

our 

business and operations. 

We are &#160;

subject to &#160;

extensive regulation &#160;

under U.S. &#160;

federal, state &#160;

and Puerto &#160;

Rico laws &#160;

that govern &#160;

almost all &#160;

aspects of 

our operations and limit the businesses &#160;

in which we may be &#160;

engaged, including regulation, supervision and examination by federal, 

state and foreign banking &#160;

authorities. These laws and regulations &#160;

have expanded significantly over an &#160;

extended period of time &#160;

and 

are primarily intended &#160;

for the protection &#160;

of consumers, borrowers and &#160;

depositors. Compliance with &#160;

these laws and &#160;

regulations has 

resulted, and will continue to result, in significant &#160;

costs. 

Additional &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

enacted &#160;

or &#160;

adopted &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

future &#160;

that &#160;

could &#160;

significantly &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

powers, 

authority &#160;

and &#160;

operations and &#160;

which could &#160;

have a &#160;

material adverse &#160;

effect &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

financial condition &#160;

and &#160;

results &#160;

of &#160;

operations. In 

particular, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

adversely &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, &#160;

or &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

application, &#160;

interpretation &#160;

or 

enforcement of &#160;

laws and &#160;

regulations, that proscribe &#160;

or institute more &#160;

stringent restrictions on &#160;

certain financial &#160;

services activities or 

impose new &#160;

requirements relating to &#160;

the impact of &#160;

business activities on &#160;

ESG concerns, the &#160;

management of &#160;

risks associated with 

those &#160;

concerns &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

offering of &#160;

products &#160;

intended to &#160;

achieve ESG-related &#160;

objectives. If &#160;

we &#160;

do not &#160;

appropriately comply &#160;

with 

current or &#160;

future laws &#160;

or regulations, &#160;

we may &#160;

be subject &#160;

to fines, &#160;

penalties or &#160;

judgements, or to &#160;

material regulatory restrictions &#160;

on 

our business, which could also materially and adversely &#160;

affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our participation &#160;

(or lack &#160;

of participation) &#160;

in certain &#160;

governmental programs, &#160;

such as &#160;

the Paycheck &#160;

Protection Program 

(&#8220;PPP&#8221;) enacted &#160;

in response &#160;

to the &#160;

COVID-19 pandemic, &#160;

also exposes &#160;

us to &#160;

increased legal &#160;

and regulatory &#160;

risks. We &#160;

have also 

been and could continue to &#160;

be exposed to adverse &#160;

action for the violation of &#160;

applicable legal requirements or the improper &#160;

conduct 

of our employees in connection with such loans. For example, on January 24, 2023, Popular Bank consented to the imposition of an 

order from &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

requiring it &#160;

to &#160;

pay a &#160;

$2.3 million &#160;

civil money &#160;

penalty to &#160;

settle certain &#160;

findings arising &#160;

from 

Popular Bank&#8217;s approval of six (6) Payment Protection Program loans. We may also have credit risk with respect to PPP loans if the 

SBA determines that &#160;

there have been &#160;

deficiencies in the &#160;

way a PPP &#160;

loan was originated, &#160;

funded, or serviced &#160;

by us and &#160;

denies its 

liability under the guaranty, &#160;

reduces the amount of the &#160;

guaranty or, if &#160;

it has already paid &#160;

under the guaranty, &#160;

seeks recovery of any 

loss related to the deficiency. 

We &#160;

are from &#160;

time to &#160;

time subject &#160;

to information &#160;

requests, investigations &#160;

and other &#160;

regulatory enforcement &#160;

proceedings 

from departments &#160;

of the &#160;

U.S. and &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

governments, including &#160;

those that &#160;

investigate compliance &#160;

with consumer 

protection &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, which &#160;

may &#160;

expose &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

significant penalties &#160;

and &#160;

collateral consequences, &#160;

and &#160;

could 

result in higher compliance costs or restrictions &#160;

on our operations. 

We from time-to-time self-report &#160;

compliance matters to, or receive &#160;

requests for information from, departments of &#160;

the U.S. 

and Puerto &#160;

Rico governments, &#160;

including with &#160;

respect to &#160;

compliance with &#160;

consumer protection &#160;

laws and &#160;

regulations. For &#160;

example, 

BPPR has &#160;

in the &#160;

past received &#160;

subpoenas and &#160;

other requests &#160;

for information &#160;

from the &#160;

departments of &#160;

the U.S. &#160;

government that 

investigate &#160;

mortgage-related conduct, &#160;

mainly &#160;

concerning &#160;

real &#160;

estate &#160;

appraisals &#160;

and &#160;

residential &#160;

and &#160;

construction &#160;

loans &#160;

in &#160;

Puerto 

Rico. BPPR &#160;

has also &#160;

self-identified and &#160;

reported to &#160;

applicable regulators compliance &#160;

matters related &#160;

to mortgage, &#160;

credit reporting 

and other consumer lending practices. &#160;

Incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities have resulted in the past, and may 

in the &#160;

future result, in &#160;

judgments, settlements, fines, &#160;

enforcement actions, penalties &#160;

or other sanctions &#160;

adverse to the &#160;

Corporation, 

which could materially and adversely affect the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause &#160;

serious 

reputational &#160;

harm. &#160;

In &#160;

connection with &#160;

the &#160;

resolution &#160;

of &#160;

regulatory proceedings, &#160;

enforcement authorities &#160;

may &#160;

seek &#160;

admissions of 

wrongdoing &#160;

and, &#160;

in &#160;

some &#160;

cases, &#160;

criminal &#160;

pleas, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

lead &#160;

to &#160;

increased &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

private &#160;

litigation, &#160;

loss &#160;

of &#160;

clients &#160;

or 

customers, &#160;

and &#160;

restrictions &#160;

on &#160;

offering &#160;

certain &#160;

products &#160;

or &#160;

services. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

responding &#160;

to &#160;

information-gathering &#160;

requests, 

investigations and &#160;

other regulatory &#160;

proceedings, regardless &#160;

of the &#160;

ultimate &#160;

outcome of &#160;

the matter, &#160;

could be &#160;

time-consuming and 

expensive. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power 

to &#160;

prevent &#160;

or &#160;

remedy &#160;

what &#160;

they &#160;

deem &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

unsafe &#160;

and &#160;

unsound &#160;

practices &#160;

or &#160;

violations &#160;

of &#160;

laws &#160;

by &#160;

banks &#160;

and &#160;

bank &#160;

holding 

companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion &#160;

and power could have a negative impact &#160;

on Popular. 

Complying with economic and trade sanctions programs &#160;

and anti-money laundering laws and regulations &#160;

can increase our 

operational &#160;

and &#160;

compliance &#160;

costs &#160;

and &#160;

risks. &#160;

If &#160;

we, &#160;

and &#160;

our &#160;

subsidiaries, &#160;

affiliates &#160;

or &#160;

third-party &#160;

service &#160;

providers, &#160;

are 

found to &#160;

have failed &#160;

to comply &#160;

with applicable &#160;

economic and &#160;

trade sanctions &#160;

programs and &#160;

anti-money laundering &#160;

laws 

and &#160;

regulations, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

exposed &#160;

to &#160;

fines, &#160;

sanctions &#160;

and &#160;

penalties, &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

regulatory &#160;

actions, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as 

governmental investigations. 

As &#160;

a &#160;

federally &#160;

regulated &#160;

financial &#160;

institution, &#160;

we &#160;

must &#160;

comply &#160;

with &#160;

regulations &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

and &#160;

trade &#160;

sanctions &#160;

and 

embargo &#160;

programs &#160;

administered by &#160;

the &#160;

Office &#160;

of &#160;

Foreign &#160;

Assets &#160;

Control &#160;

(&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Treasury, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

anti-money 

laundering laws and regulations, including those under &#160;

the Bank Secrecy Act. 

Economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by OFAC prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering 

into or facilitating &#160;

unlicensed transactions with, for &#160;

the benefit of, &#160;

or in some &#160;

or &#160;

more &#160;

sanctions &#160;

regimes. &#160;

We &#160;

are &#160;

also 

subject to &#160;

a variety &#160;

of reporting &#160;

and other &#160;

requirements under &#160;

the Bank &#160;

Secrecy Act, &#160;

including the &#160;

requirement to &#160;

file suspicious 

activity and currency &#160;

transaction reports, that &#160;

are designed to &#160;

assist in &#160;

the detection &#160;

and prevention of &#160;

money laundering, terrorist 

financing &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

criminal &#160;

activities. &#160;

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

financial &#160;

institution &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to, &#160;

among &#160;

other &#160;

things, &#160;

identify &#160;

our 

customers, adopt formal &#160;

and comprehensive anti-money &#160;

laundering programs, scrutinize &#160;

or altogether prohibit &#160;

certain transactions 

of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. &#160;

law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and &#160;

their 

transactions. Failure &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation, its &#160;

subsidiaries, affiliates &#160;

or &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers to &#160;

comply with &#160;

these &#160;

laws &#160;

and 

regulations &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

serious &#160;

legal &#160;

and &#160;

reputational &#160;

consequences &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation, &#160;

including &#160;

the &#160;

possibility &#160;

of &#160;

regulatory 

enforcement &#160;

or &#160;

other &#160;

legal &#160;

action, &#160;

including &#160;

significant &#160;

civil &#160;

and &#160;

criminal &#160;

penalties. &#160;

We &#160;

also &#160;

incur &#160;

higher &#160;

costs &#160;

and &#160;

face &#160;

greater 

compliance risks in &#160;

structuring and operating &#160;

our businesses to comply &#160;

with these requirements. The &#160;

markets in which &#160;

we operate 

heighten these costs and risks. 

We have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us &#160;

and our personnel in complying with these 

applicable laws and &#160;

regulations. With respect &#160;

to OFAC &#160;

regulations and economic &#160;

and trade sanction &#160;

programs, these policies &#160;

and 

procedures employ software to screen transactions for &#160;

evidence of sanctioned-country and person&#8217;s involvement. Consistent with &#160;

a 

risk-based approach and the &#160;

difficulties in identifying and &#160;

where applicable, blocking and rejecting &#160;

transactions of our customers &#160;

or 

our customers&#8217; customers that may involve a sanctioned &#160;

person, government or country, there can be no assurance that our policies 

and &#160;

procedures &#160;

will &#160;

prevent &#160;

us &#160;

from &#160;

violating &#160;

applicable &#160;

laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations &#160;

in &#160;

transactions &#160;

in &#160;

which &#160;

we &#160;

engage, &#160;

and &#160;

such 

violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, &#160;

financial condition and results of operations. 

From time &#160;

to time &#160;

we have &#160;

identified and &#160;

voluntarily self-disclosed &#160;

to OFAC &#160;

transactions that &#160;

were not &#160;

timely identified, 

blocked &#160;

or &#160;

rejected &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

policies, &#160;

controls &#160;

and &#160;

procedures &#160;

for &#160;

screening &#160;

transactions &#160;

that &#160;

might &#160;

violate &#160;

the &#160;

regulations &#160;

and 

economic and &#160;

trade sanctions &#160;

programs administered &#160;

by OFAC. &#160;

For example, &#160;

during the &#160;

second quarter &#160;

of 2022, &#160;

BPPR entered 

into &#160;

a &#160;

settlement &#160;

agreement &#160;

with &#160;

OFAC &#160;

with &#160;

respect &#160;

to &#160;

certain &#160;

transactions &#160;

processed &#160;

on &#160;

behalf &#160;

of &#160;

two &#160;

employees &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Government &#160;

of &#160;

Venezuela, &#160;

in &#160;

apparent &#160;

violation &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. &#160;

sanctions &#160;

against &#160;

Venezuela. &#160;

Popular &#160;

agreed &#160;

to &#160;

pay &#160;

approximately 

$256,000 to settle the &#160;

apparent violations, which had been &#160;

self disclosed to OFAC. &#160;

There can be no &#160;

assurances that any failure &#160;

to 

comply with &#160;

U.S. sanctions &#160;

and embargoes, &#160;

or &#160;

with anti-money &#160;

laundering laws &#160;

and &#160;

regulations, will &#160;

not result &#160;

in material &#160;

fines, 

sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. 

Furthermore, if &#160;

the policies, &#160;

controls, and &#160;

procedures of &#160;

one of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

third-party service &#160;

providers, together 

with our &#160;

third-party oversight &#160;

of such &#160;

providers, do &#160;

not prevent &#160;

it from &#160;

violating applicable &#160;

laws and &#160;

regulations in &#160;

transactions in 

which it engages, such violations could adversely affect its &#160;

ability to provide services to us. &#160;

We &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

regulatory &#160;

capital &#160;

adequacy &#160;

requirements, &#160;

and &#160;

if &#160;

we &#160;

fail &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

these &#160;

requirements &#160;

our 

business and financial condition will be adversely &#160;

affected. 

Under regulatory capital adequacy requirements, and other &#160;

regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries 

must &#160;

meet &#160;

requirements &#160;

that &#160;

include &#160;

quantitative &#160;

measures &#160;

of &#160;

assets, &#160;

liabilities &#160;

and &#160;

certain &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

items, &#160;

subject &#160;

to 

qualitative &#160;

judgments &#160;

by &#160;

regulators &#160;

regarding &#160;

components, &#160;

risk &#160;

weightings &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

factors. &#160;

If &#160;

we &#160;

fail &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

these &#160;

minimum 

capital &#160;

requirements &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

regulatory &#160;

requirements, &#160;

our &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

financial &#160;

condition &#160;

will &#160;

be &#160;

materially &#160;

and &#160;

adversely 

affected. If &#160;

a financial &#160;

holding company &#160;

fails to &#160;

maintain well-capitalized &#160;

status under &#160;

the regulatory &#160;

framework, or &#160;

is deemed &#160;

not 

well managed &#160;

under regulatory &#160;

exam procedures, or &#160;

if it &#160;

experiences certain &#160;

regulatory violations, its &#160;

status as &#160;

a financial &#160;

holding 

company and its &#160;

related eligibility for &#160;

a streamlined review &#160;

process for acquisition &#160;

proposals, and its &#160;

ability to offer &#160;

certain financial 

products, may be &#160;

compromised and its &#160;

financial condition and &#160;

results of operations &#160;

could be adversely &#160;

affected. The failure &#160;

of any 

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

subsidiary &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

financial &#160;

holding &#160;

company &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

well-capitalized &#160;

or &#160;

well-managed &#160;

status &#160;

could &#160;

have 

similar consequences. 

&#160;

In addition, &#160;

the Basel &#160;

Committee on &#160;

Banking Supervision &#160;

published a &#160;

set of &#160;

standards to &#160;

finalize Basel &#160;

III in &#160;

December 

2017. These standards significantly revise the Basel capital framework, which could heighten regulatory capital standards if adopted 

in the U.S. The federal bank regulators &#160;

have not yet proposed rules to implement these &#160;

revisions,

and the impact on us will depend 

on the way &#160;

the revisions are implemented &#160;

in the U.S. &#160;

Basel III finalization. 

Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may &#160;

have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 

Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and PB are subject to insurance up to applicable limits by the FDIC&#8217;s DIF and, as a 

result, BPPR and PB are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. &#160;

On October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that would 

increase initial &#160;

base deposit insurance &#160;

assessment rates by &#160;

2 basis &#160;

points, beginning with &#160;

the first &#160;

quarterly assessment period &#160;

of 

2023. &#160;

We &#160;

are &#160;

generally &#160;

unable to &#160;

control the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

premiums that &#160;

we &#160;

are &#160;

required to &#160;

pay &#160;

for &#160;

FDIC &#160;

insurance. If &#160;

there &#160;

are 

additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increases, or our risk profile changes or our capital 

position is &#160;

impaired, we &#160;

may be &#160;

required to &#160;

pay even &#160;

higher FDIC &#160;

premiums. Any &#160;

future increases &#160;

or special &#160;

assessments may 

materially adversely &#160;

affect our &#160;

LIQUIDITY RISKS 

We are &#160;

subject to risks &#160;

related to our &#160;

own credit rating &#160;

and capital levels. &#160;

Actions by the &#160;

rating agencies or &#160;

decreases in 

our capital &#160;

levels may &#160;

have adverse effects &#160;

on our &#160;

business, including by &#160;

raising the cost &#160;

of our &#160;

obligations or affecting 

our ability to borrow. 

Actions by the rating agencies &#160;

could raise the cost of &#160;

our borrowings, since lower rated securities &#160;

are usually required by 

the market &#160;

to pay &#160;

higher rates &#160;

than obligations &#160;

of higher &#160;

credit quality. &#160;

Our credit &#160;

ratings were &#160;

reduced substantially in &#160;

2009 and, 

although one of &#160;

the three major rating &#160;

agencies upgraded our senior &#160;

unsecured rating back to &#160;

&#8220;investment grade&#8221; during 2021, &#160;

the 

remaining two rating agencies have not &#160;

upgraded their current &#8220;non-investment grade&#8221; rating. The &#160;

market for non-investment grade 

securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. If we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or &#160;

debt 

securities into the capital markets, it &#160;

is possible that there would not &#160;

be sufficient demand to complete &#160;

a transaction or that the &#160;

cost 

could be substantially higher than for more highly &#160;

rated securities. 

In &#160;

addition, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

our &#160;

ratings &#160;

and &#160;

capital &#160;

levels &#160;

could &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

relationships &#160;

with &#160;

some &#160;

creditors &#160;

and &#160;

business 

counterparties. For example, having &#160;

negative tangible capital may &#160;

impact our ability to &#160;

access some sources of &#160;

wholesale funding. 

The Federal Housing Finance Agency &#160;

restricts the Federal Home &#160;

Loan Bank of New &#160;

York &#160;

(&#8220;FHLBNY&#8221;) from lending to members &#160;

of 

the FHLBNY with negative &#160;

tangible capital unless the &#160;

member&#8217;s primary banking regulator makes a &#160;

written request to the &#160;

FHLBNY 

to &#160;

maintain access &#160;

to &#160;

borrowings. Both &#160;

BPPR &#160;

and PB &#160;

have secured &#160;

borrowing facilities &#160;

with the &#160;

FHLBNY, &#160;

and &#160;

had &#160;

outstanding 

exposures of $1.9 &#160;

billion and $1.4 million &#160;

respectively as of December 31, &#160;

2022. Losing access to &#160;

the FHLBNY borrowing facilities 

could adversely impact &#160;

liquidity at the &#160;

banking subsidiaries. Additionally, &#160;

if BPPR or &#160;

PB cease to &#160;

be well-capitalized, the &#160;

FDIA and 

regulations &#160;

adopted thereunder &#160;

would &#160;

restrict &#160;

their &#160;

ability to &#160;

accept &#160;

brokered &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

limits &#160;

the &#160;

rate &#160;

of &#160;

interest &#160;

payable &#160;

on 

deposits. &#160;

&#160;

Our banking &#160;

subsidiaries also have &#160;

recourse obligations under &#160;

certain agreements with &#160;

third parties, including 

servicing and &#160;

custodial agreements, &#160;

that include &#160;

ratings covenants. &#160;

Upon failure &#160;

to &#160;

maintain the &#160;

required credit &#160;

ratings, the &#160;

third 

parties could &#160;

have the &#160;

right to &#160;

require us &#160;

to &#160;

engage a &#160;

substitute fund &#160;

custodian and &#160;

increase collateral &#160;

levels securing &#160;

recourse 

obligations. Collateral pledged by &#160;

us to secure &#160;

recourse obligations approximated $29 &#160;

million at December &#160;

31, 2022. Management 

expects &#160;

that &#160;

we &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

able &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

any &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements &#160;

if &#160;

and &#160;

when &#160;

needed. &#160;

The &#160;

requirements &#160;

to &#160;

post 

collateral under &#160;

certain agreements &#160;

or the &#160;

loss of &#160;

custodian funds, &#160;

however, &#160;

could reduce &#160;

our liquidity &#160;

resources and &#160;

impact our 

results of operations. The termination of those agreements or the &#160;

inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have 

an &#160;

adverse &#160;

effect &#160;

on &#160;

those &#160;

businesses. &#160;

Other &#160;

counterparties &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

sensitive &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

risk &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

ratings &#160;

downgrade &#160;

and &#160;

the 

implications &#160;

for &#160;

our &#160;

businesses, &#160;

and &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

less &#160;

likely &#160;

to &#160;

engage &#160;

in &#160;

transactions &#160;

with &#160;

us, &#160;

or &#160;

may &#160;

only &#160;

engage &#160;

in &#160;

them &#160;

at &#160;

a 

substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below &#160;

investment grade. 

As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from &#160;

our subsidiaries for liquidity. 

As a bank holding company, &#160;

we depend primarily on dividends from &#160;

our banking and other operating subsidiaries &#160;

to fund 

our cash needs, including to capitalize our subsidiaries. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and PB, are limited by law in their ability to 

make dividend &#160;

payments and other &#160;

distributions to &#160;

us based &#160;

on their earnings, &#160;

dividend history, &#160;

and capital &#160;

position. Based &#160;

on its 

current financial condition, &#160;

PB may &#160;

not declare or &#160;

pay a &#160;

dividend without the &#160;

prior approval of &#160;

the Federal Reserve &#160;

Board and &#160;

the 

NYSDFS. A &#160;

failure by &#160;

our banking subsidiaries &#160;

to generate &#160;

sufficient income &#160;

and free &#160;

cash flow to &#160;

make dividend &#160;

payments to &#160;

us 

may &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

ability to &#160;

fund &#160;

our cash &#160;

needs, which &#160;

could have &#160;

a negative &#160;

impact on &#160;

our financial &#160;

condition, liquidity, &#160;

results &#160;

of 

operation or capital position. Such failure could also affect &#160;

our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and to &#160;

repurchase shares 

of our common stock. We have in the past suspended dividend payments &#160;

on our common stock and preferred stock during times of 

economic uncertainty, &#160;

and there &#160;

can be &#160;

no assurance &#160;

that we &#160;

will be &#160;

able to &#160;

continue to &#160;

declare dividends to &#160;

our stockholders &#160;

in 

any future periods. &#160;

An &#160;

impact &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

levels &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

operating &#160;

subsidiaries, &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

capital &#160;

we &#160;

may 

upstream to the holding company. &#160;

Tangible &#160;

capital levels have, and may continue to &#160;

be, adversely affected by the impact &#160;

of rapidly 

rising interest rates on investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. For a discussion &#160;

rates, &#160;

our &#160;

including &#160;

our &#160;

investment 

portfolio, since a significant portion of our &#160;

business involves borrowing and lending money, &#160;

and investing in financial instruments&#8221; &#160;

in 

Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

We also depend &#160;

on dividends from our &#160;

banking and other operating subsidiaries &#160;

to pay debt service &#160;

on outstanding debt 

and to &#160;

repay maturing &#160;

debt. We &#160;

have $300 &#160;

million of &#160;

notes that &#160;

mature on &#160;

September 14, &#160;

2023. If &#160;

we were &#160;

unable to &#160;

refinance 

these &#160;

notes, we &#160;

could &#160;

have to &#160;

declare extraordinary &#160;

dividends from &#160;

our &#160;

banking &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

operating subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

repay such 

notes. Our ability to &#160;

declare such dividends would be &#160;

subject to regulatory requirements and &#160;

could require the prior &#160;

approval of the 

Federal Reserve Board. 

STRATEGIC RISKS 

Potential acquisitions of businesses or &#160;

loan portfolios could increase some &#160;

of the risks that &#160;

we face, and may &#160;

be delayed 

or prohibited due to regulatory constraints. 

To &#160;

the extent &#160;

permitted by &#160;

our applicable &#160;

regulators, we &#160;

may pursue &#160;

strategic acquisition &#160;

opportunities. Acquiring &#160;

other 

businesses, however, involves various risks, &#160;

including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the &#160;

target company, 

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

potential &#160;

asset &#160;

quality &#160;

issues &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

target &#160;

company, &#160;

potential &#160;

disruption &#160;

to &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

the &#160;

possible &#160;

loss &#160;

of &#160;

key 

employees and customers of &#160;

the target company, &#160;

and difficulty in &#160;

estimating the value of &#160;

the target company. &#160;

If we pay &#160;

a premium 

over book or &#160;

market value in &#160;

connection with an &#160;

acquisition, some dilution of &#160;

our tangible book &#160;

value and net &#160;

income per common 

share &#160;

may &#160;

occur &#160;

in &#160;

connection with &#160;

any &#160;

future &#160;

transaction. Furthermore, &#160;

failure &#160;

to &#160;

realize the &#160;

expected &#160;

revenue increases, &#160;

cost 

savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse 

effect on our business, financial condition and results of &#160;

operations. 

Similarly, &#160;

acquiring &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

involves &#160;

various &#160;

risks. &#160;

When &#160;

acquiring &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios, &#160;

management &#160;

makes 

assumptions and &#160;

judgments about &#160;

the collectability &#160;

of the &#160;

loans, including &#160;

the creditworthiness &#160;

of borrowers &#160;

and the &#160;

value of &#160;

the 

real &#160;

estate and &#160;

other assets &#160;

serving &#160;

as collateral &#160;

for the &#160;

repayment of &#160;

secured loans. &#160;

In &#160;

estimating the &#160;

extent of &#160;

the losses, &#160;

we 

analyze &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolio &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

historical &#160;

loss &#160;

experience, &#160;

volume &#160;

and &#160;

classification &#160;

of &#160;

loans, &#160;

volume &#160;

and &#160;

trends &#160;

in 

delinquencies &#160;

and &#160;

nonaccruals, &#160;

local &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

and &#160;

other &#160;

pertinent &#160;

information. &#160;

If &#160;

our &#160;

assumptions &#160;

are &#160;

incorrect, 

however, &#160;

our actual &#160;

losses could &#160;

be higher &#160;

than estimated &#160;

and increased &#160;

loss reserves &#160;

may be &#160;

required, which &#160;

would negatively 

affect our results of operations. 

Finally, certain &#160;

acquisitions by financial institutions, &#160;

including us, are &#160;

subject to approval &#160;

by a variety &#160;

of federal and &#160;

state 

regulatory agencies. &#160;

Regulatory approvals &#160;

could be &#160;

delayed, impeded, &#160;

restrictively conditioned &#160;

or denied. &#160;

We may &#160;

fail to &#160;

pursue, 

evaluate &#160;

or &#160;

complete &#160;

strategic &#160;

and &#160;

competitively &#160;

significant &#160;

acquisition &#160;

opportunities &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

inability, &#160;

or &#160;

perceived &#160;

or 

anticipated inability, &#160;

to obtain regulatory &#160;

approvals in a &#160;

timely manner, &#160;

under reasonable conditions or &#160;

at all. Difficulties &#160;

associated 

with &#160;

potential &#160;

acquisitions &#160;

that &#160;

may &#160;

result &#160;

from &#160;

these &#160;

factors &#160;

could &#160;

have &#160;

a &#160;

material &#160;

adverse &#160;

effect &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. 

We &#160;

have &#160;

embarked &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

broad-based &#160;

multi-year, &#160;

technological &#160;

and &#160;

business &#160;

process &#160;

transformation. &#160;

The &#160;

failure &#160;

to 

achieve &#160;

the &#160;

goals &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

transformation &#160;

project, &#160;

the &#160;

inability &#160;

to &#160;

maintain &#160;

project &#160;

expenses &#160;

within &#160;

current &#160;

estimates &#160;

or 

delays in &#160;

executing our plans &#160;

to implement the &#160;

transformation project, may &#160;

materially and adversely &#160;

affect our business, 

financial condition, results of operations, or &#160;

cause reputational harm.

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

embarked &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

broad-based &#160;

multi-year, &#160;

technological &#160;

and &#160;

business &#160;

process &#160;

transformation. Our 

technology and &#160;

business transformation will &#160;

be a significant &#160;

priority for the &#160;

Corporation over the &#160;

next three years &#160;

and beyond. &#160;

We 

expect the &#160;

expenses tied &#160;

to this &#160;

transformation project, &#160;

which will &#160;

continue through &#160;

at least &#160;

2025, to &#160;

result in &#160;

an enhanced &#160;

digital 

experience for our clients, as well as better technology &#160;

and more efficient processes for our employees. &#160;

To &#160;

execute the &#160;

transformation project, &#160;

we plan &#160;

to expand &#160;

our digital &#160;

capabilities, modernize &#160;

our technology &#160;

foundation, 

and &#160;

implement &#160;

agile &#160;

and &#160;

efficient &#160;

business &#160;

processes &#160;

across &#160;

the &#160;

entire &#160;

company. &#160;

We &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

succeed &#160;

in &#160;

executing &#160;

the 

transformation project, may fail &#160;

to properly estimate cost &#160;

of the same, or &#160;

may experience delays in &#160;

executing our plans, which &#160;

may 

in turn &#160;

cause the &#160;

Corporation to &#160;

incur costs &#160;

exceeding our &#160;

current estimates &#160;

or disrupt &#160;

our operations, &#160;

including our &#160;

technological 

services to our customers, or fall short &#160;

of our projected earnings targets driven by these &#160;

efforts. To &#160;

the extent that these disruptions 

persist over time and/or recur, this could negatively impact our competitive &#160;

position, require additional expenditures, and/or harm &#160;

our 

relationships &#160;

with &#160;

our &#160;

customers &#160;

and &#160;

thus &#160;

may &#160;

materially &#160;

and &#160;

adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

business, &#160;

financial &#160;

condition, &#160;

results &#160;

of 

operations, or cause reputational harm. 

We face significant and increasing competition in the &#160;

rapidly evolving financial services industry. 

&#160;

We &#160;

operate &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

highly competitive &#160;

environment, in &#160;

which &#160;

we &#160;

compete &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

basis &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

number of &#160;

factors, &#160;

including 

customer service, &#160;

quality and variety &#160;

of products &#160;

and services, &#160;

price, interest rates &#160;

on loans &#160;

and deposits, &#160;

innovation, technology, 

ease of use, reputation, and transaction execution. While our main competition &#160;

continues to come from other Puerto Rico banks and 

financial &#160;

institutions, &#160;

we &#160;

may &#160;

face &#160;

increased &#160;

competition &#160;

from &#160;

other &#160;

institutions &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

future &#160;

as &#160;

emerging &#160;

technologies &#160;

and &#160;

the 

growth of e-commerce have significantly reduced geographic barriers, made it easier for non-depositary institutions to offer products 

and &#160;

services &#160;

that &#160;

traditionally &#160;

were &#160;

banking &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

allowed &#160;

non-traditional &#160;

financial &#160;

service &#160;

providers &#160;

and &#160;

technology 

companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services. Increased competition could create &#160;

pressure to 

lower &#160;

prices, &#160;

fees, &#160;

commissions &#160;

or &#160;

credit &#160;

standards &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

services, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

adversely &#160;

affect &#160;

our &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. Increased competition could also &#160;

create pressure to raise interest rates on deposits, which could 

also impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to &#160;

meet constant technological changes and react quickly to &#160;

meet new industry standards, including as a 

result &#160;

of our &#160;

continued dependence &#160;

on &#160;

Evertec, we &#160;

may &#160;

be unable &#160;

to enhance &#160;

our &#160;

current services &#160;

and introduce &#160;

new 

products and &#160;

services in &#160;

a timely &#160;

and cost-effective &#160;

manner, &#160;

placing us &#160;

at a &#160;

competitive disadvantage &#160;

and significantly 

affecting our business, financial condition and results &#160;

of operations.

To compete effectively, &#160;

we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products 

and &#160;

services &#160;

to &#160;

attract &#160;

and &#160;

retain &#160;

clients &#160;

or &#160;

to &#160;

match &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

services &#160;

offered &#160;

by &#160;

our &#160;

competitors, &#160;

including &#160;

technology 

companies and &#160;

other nonbank &#160;

firms that &#160;

are engaged &#160;

in providing &#160;

similar products &#160;

and services. &#160;

Although the &#160;

Evertec Business 

Acquisition Transaction eliminated certain &#160;

provisions of a previous Master Services &#160;

Agreement with Evertec that required &#160;

us to use 

Evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or &#160;

enhanced products and services, and is expected to &#160;

improve Popular&#8217;s ability 

to manage &#160;

and control &#160;

the development &#160;

of the &#160;

customer channels &#160;

supported by &#160;

the Acquired &#160;

Assets, Popular &#160;

expects that &#160;

it will 

continue to depend &#160;

on Evertec&#8217;s technology services &#160;

to operate and &#160;

control current products and &#160;

services and to &#160;

implement future 

products and &#160;

services, making &#160;

our success &#160;

dependent on &#160;

Evertec&#8217;s ability &#160;

to timely &#160;

complete and &#160;

introduce these &#160;

enhancements 

and &#160;

new &#160;

products &#160;

and &#160;

services &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

cost-effective &#160;

manner. &#160;

Our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

enhance our &#160;

customer channels &#160;

is &#160;

also &#160;

dependent &#160;

on 

Evertec timely delivering Core &#160;

APIs that meet BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

requirements, which Evertec has committed &#160;

to develop under the &#160;

MSA. The 

Core APIs are necessary for BPPR to connect &#160;

future enhancements to the Acquired Assets to existing &#160;

Evertec core applications. &#160;

Some &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

competitors &#160;

rely &#160;

on &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

technology &#160;

and &#160;

outsourcing &#160;

companies &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

much &#160;

larger &#160;

than 

Evertec, serve a &#160;

greater number of &#160;

clients than Evertec, &#160;

and may have &#160;

better technological capabilities and &#160;

product offerings than 

Evertec. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

technology &#160;

companies &#160;

typically &#160;

make &#160;

capital &#160;

investments &#160;

to &#160;

develop &#160;

and &#160;

modify &#160;

their 

product &#160;

and &#160;

service &#160;

offerings &#160;

to &#160;

facilitate &#160;

their &#160;

customers&#8217; &#160;

compliance &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

extensive &#160;

and &#160;

evolving &#160;

regulatory &#160;

and &#160;

industry 

requirements, &#160;

and &#160;

in &#160;

most cases &#160;

such &#160;

costs &#160;

are &#160;

borne &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

technology provider. &#160;

Because &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

contractual &#160;

relationship with 

Evertec, and because Popular is the &#160;

sole customer of certain of &#160;

Evertec&#8217;s services and products, we &#160;

have in the past borne &#160;

the full 

cost of such developments and modifications and &#160;

may be required to do so in the future, subject &#160;

to the terms of the MSA. 

Moreover, &#160;

the terms, &#160;

speed, scalability, &#160;

and functionality &#160;

of certain &#160;

of Evertec&#8217;s &#160;

technology services &#160;

are not &#160;

competitive 

when compared &#160;

to offerings &#160;

from its &#160;

competitors. Evertec&#8217;s &#160;

failure to &#160;

sufficiently invest &#160;

in and &#160;

upscale its &#160;

technology and &#160;

services 

infrastructure to &#160;

meet the &#160;

rapidly changing &#160;

technology demands &#160;

of our &#160;

industry may &#160;

result in &#160;

us being &#160;

unable to &#160;

meet &#160;

customer 

expectations and attract &#160;

or retain customers. &#160;

Any such impact &#160;

could, in turn, &#160;

reduce Popular&#8217;s revenues, place &#160;

us in a &#160;

competitive 

disadvantage and &#160;

significantly affect &#160;

our &#160;

business, financial &#160;

condition and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations. While &#160;

the closing &#160;

of &#160;

the Evertec 

Business Acquisition &#160;

Transaction narrowed &#160;

the scope &#160;

of services &#160;

which we &#160;

are dependent &#160;

on Evertec &#160;

to obtain &#160;

and released &#160;

us 

from &#160;

exclusivity &#160;

restrictions &#160;

that &#160;

limited &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

engage &#160;

other &#160;

third-party &#160;

providers &#160;

of &#160;

financial &#160;

technology &#160;

services, &#160;

it &#160;

also 

resulted in extensions &#160;

of certain existing &#160;

commercial agreements with Evertec &#160;

and, as a &#160;

result, have prolonged &#160;

the duration of &#160;

our 

exposure to &#160;

the risks &#160;

presented by &#160;

Evertec&#8217;s technological &#160;

capabilities and &#160;

its failures &#160;

to &#160;

enhance its &#160;

products and &#160;

services &#160;

and 

otherwise meet evolving demands. 

The ability to attract and retain qualified employees &#160;

is critical to our success. 

Our &#160;

success &#160;

depends, &#160;

in &#160;

large &#160;

part, &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

attract &#160;

and &#160;

retain &#160;

qualified &#160;

employees. Competition &#160;

for &#160;

qualified 

candidates is intense and has &#160;

increased recently as a result &#160;

of a tighter labor market. Increased competition &#160;

may lead to difficulties 

in &#160;

attracting &#160;

or &#160;

retaining qualified &#160;

employees, which &#160;

may, &#160;

in turn, &#160;

lead to &#160;

significant challenges &#160;

in the &#160;

execution &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

business 

strategies and &#160;

have an &#160;

adverse effect &#160;

on the &#160;

quality of the &#160;

service we &#160;

provide to &#160;

the customers &#160;

and communities we &#160;

serve. Such 

challenges could &#160;

adversely affect &#160;

our business, &#160;

operations and &#160;

financial condition. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

increased competition &#160;

may lead &#160;

to 

higher compensation &#160;

packages and &#160;

more flexible &#160;

work arrangements. &#160;

We may &#160;

also be &#160;

required to &#160;

hire employees &#160;

outside of &#160;

our 

market &#160;

areas &#160;

for &#160;

certain &#160;

positions &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

specific &#160;

expertise, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

employment &#160;

and &#160;

tax &#160;

compliance-related 

expenses, challenges and &#160;

risks. In &#160;

addition, flexible &#160;

work arrangements, such &#160;

as remote &#160;

or hybrid &#160;

work models, have &#160;

led to &#160;

other 

workplace &#160;

challenges, &#160;

including fewer &#160;

opportunities &#160;

for &#160;

face-to-face interactions &#160;

or &#160;

to &#160;

promote &#160;

a &#160;

cohesive &#160;

corporate &#160;

culture &#160;

and 

heightened cybersecurity, information security and other operational risks. 

Our &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

attract &#160;

and &#160;

retain &#160;

qualified &#160;

employees &#160;

is &#160;

also &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

regulatory &#160;

limitations &#160;

on &#160;

our &#160;

compensation 

practices, such a s clawback requirements of incentive compensation, &#160;

which may not affect other institutions with which we compete 

for talent. The &#160;

scope and &#160;

content of &#160;

regulators&#8217; policies &#160;

on executive &#160;

compensation continue to &#160;

develop and &#160;

are likely &#160;

to continue 

evolving. Such policies and limitations on our compensation &#160;

practices could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate 

talented senior leaders in support of our long-term &#160;

strategy. 

OTHER RISKS 

An impairment &#160;

of our &#160;

goodwill, deferred &#160;

tax assets &#160;

or amortizable &#160;

intangible assets &#160;

could adversely &#160;

affect our &#160;

financial 

condition and results of operations. 

As of December 31, &#160;

2022, we had approximately $827 &#160;

million, $954 million and &#160;

$94 million, respectively, &#160;

of goodwill, net 

deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets &#160;

recorded on our balance sheet. 

Under &#160;

GAAP, &#160;

goodwill &#160;

is &#160;

tested &#160;

for &#160;

impairment &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

annually &#160;

and &#160;

amortizable &#160;

intangible &#160;

assets &#160;

are &#160;

tested &#160;

for 

impairment &#160;

when &#160;

events &#160;

or &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

circumstances indicate &#160;

the &#160;

carrying value &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

be &#160;

recoverable. Factors &#160;

that &#160;

may &#160;

be 

considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be 

recoverable, include &#160;

a decline in &#160;

Popular&#8217;s stock price &#160;

related to &#160;

a deterioration in &#160;

global or &#160;

local economic conditions, &#160;

declines in 

our market capitalization, reduced future earnings estimates, and interest rate changes. The goodwill impairment evaluation process 

requires &#160;

us &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

estimates &#160;

and &#160;

assumptions &#160;

with &#160;

regards &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

fair &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

our &#160;

reporting &#160;

units. &#160;

Actual &#160;

values &#160;

may &#160;

differ 

significantly &#160;

from &#160;

these &#160;

estimates. &#160;

Such &#160;

differences &#160;

could &#160;

result &#160;

in &#160;

future &#160;

impairment &#160;

of &#160;

goodwill &#160;

that &#160;

would, &#160;

in &#160;

turn, &#160;

negatively 

impact our results of operations and the reporting &#160;

unit where the goodwill is recorded. 

The &#160;

determination &#160;

of &#160;

whether &#160;

a &#160;

deferred &#160;

tax &#160;

asset &#160;

is &#160;

realizable &#160;

is &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

weighting &#160;

all &#160;

available &#160;

evidence. &#160;

The 

realization &#160;

of &#160;

deferred &#160;

tax &#160;

assets, including &#160;

carryforwards &#160;

and &#160;

deductible temporary &#160;

differences, &#160;

depends upon &#160;

the &#160;

existence &#160;

of 

sufficient taxable &#160;

income of the &#160;

same character during &#160;

the carryback or &#160;

carryforward period. The &#160;

analysis considers all &#160;

sources of 

taxable income &#160;

available to &#160;

realize the &#160;

deferred tax &#160;

asset, including &#160;

the future &#160;

reversal of &#160;

existing taxable &#160;

temporary differences, 

future taxable income &#160;

exclusive of reversing temporary &#160;

differences and carryforwards, &#160;

taxable income in &#160;

prior carryback years and 

tax-planning strategies. Changes in these &#160;

factors may affect &#160;

the realizability of our &#160;

deferred tax assets in &#160;

our Puerto Rico and &#160;

U.S. 

operations. 

If our &#160;

goodwill, deferred &#160;

tax assets &#160;

or amortizable &#160;

intangible assets &#160;

become impaired, &#160;

we may &#160;

be required &#160;

to record &#160;

a 

significant charge to earnings, which could adversely &#160;

affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We could experience unexpected &#160;

losses if the estimates &#160;

or assumptions we use &#160;

in preparing our financial &#160;

statements are 

incorrect or differ materially from actual results. 

In preparing &#160;

our financial &#160;

statements pursuant &#160;

to U.S. &#160;

GAAP, &#160;

we are &#160;

required to &#160;

make estimates &#160;

and assumptions &#160;

that 

are often based &#160;

on subjective and &#160;

complex judgments about &#160;

matters that are &#160;

inherently uncertain. For example, &#160;

we use estimates 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses, our &#160;

liability for contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain 

of our &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, such &#160;

as debt &#160;

securities, loans &#160;

held for &#160;

sale, MSRs, &#160;

intangible assets &#160;

and deferred &#160;

tax assets. &#160;

If such 

estimates &#160;

or &#160;

assumptions are &#160;

incorrect &#160;

or &#160;

differ &#160;

materially &#160;

from &#160;

actual &#160;

results, &#160;

we &#160;

could &#160;

experience &#160;

unexpected &#160;

losses &#160;

or &#160;

other 

adverse impacts, some of which could be significant.
