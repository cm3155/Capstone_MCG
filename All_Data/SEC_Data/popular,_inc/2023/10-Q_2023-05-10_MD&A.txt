&#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

interest earning &#160;

assets include &#160;

investment securities &#160;

and loans &#160;

that are &#160;

exempt from &#160;

income tax, &#160;

principally in 

Puerto &#160;

Rico. The &#160;

main sources &#160;

of tax-exempt &#160;

interest income &#160;

are certain &#160;

investments in &#160;

obligations of &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. Government, &#160;

its 

agencies and sponsored entities, certain obligations of the Commonwealth &#160;

of Puerto Rico and/or its agencies and municipalities and 

assets held by the Corporation&#8217;s international banking entities. To facilitate the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the 

interest income &#160;

has been converted &#160;

to a &#160;

taxable equivalent basis, &#160;

using the &#160;

applicable statutory income &#160;

tax rates &#160;

for each &#160;

period. 

The &#160;

taxable equivalent &#160;

computation considers &#160;

the interest &#160;

expense and &#160;

other related &#160;

expense disallowances &#160;

required by &#160;

Puerto 

Rico tax law. Thereunder, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable &#160;

income. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

income on &#160;

a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis &#160;

is a &#160;

non-GAAP financial &#160;

measure. Management &#160;

believes that &#160;

this presentation 

provides meaningful &#160;

information since &#160;

it facilitates &#160;

the comparison &#160;

of &#160;

revenues arising &#160;

from taxable &#160;

and tax-exempt &#160;

sources. Net 

interest &#160;

income &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

taxable &#160;

equivalent &#160;

basis &#160;

(GAAP), for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

period in &#160;

2022,

assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures &#160;

the Corporation may &#160;

Financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 

&#9679;

&#160;

For the &#160;

quarter ended March &#160;

31, 2023, the &#160;

Corporation recorded net &#160;

income of $ &#160;

159.0 million, compared &#160;

to net &#160;

income of $ 

211.7 million for the same quarter of the previous year. &#160;

Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2023 was 3.22%, an increase 

of &#160;

47 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

2.75% &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

previous &#160;

year, &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

an &#160;

improvement &#160;

in 

earnings assets mix, &#160;

higher interest income &#160;

from money market, &#160;

investment and trading securities &#160;

and higher interest &#160;

income 

from loans, &#160;

which was &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by higher &#160;

interest expense &#160;

on deposits. &#160;

On a &#160;

taxable equivalent &#160;

basis, the &#160;

net interest 

margin was &#160;

of 3.46%, compared &#160;

to 3.05% &#160;

for the &#160;

same quarter &#160;

of the previous &#160;

year. For &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2023, 

the Corporation &#160;

recorded a &#160;

provision for &#160;

credit losses &#160;

of $47.6 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to &#160;

a release &#160;

of $15.5 &#160;

million for &#160;

the same 

quarter of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The higher &#160;

provision for &#160;

2023 is &#160;

attributed to &#160;

reductions in &#160;

the P.R. &#160;

Home Pricing &#160;

Index (&#8220;HPI&#8221;) 

forecast, higher loan volumes and migration of consumer credit scores. The first quarter of 2022 also included releases of ACL 

reserves &#160;

originally &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

Covid-19 &#160;

economic &#160;

uncertainty. &#160;

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

was &#160;

$162.0 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter, &#160;

an 

increase of &#160;

$7.3 million &#160;

when compared &#160;

to &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2022, &#160;

mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

other service &#160;

fees and 

income from &#160;

a litigation-related &#160;

insurance claim &#160;

reimbursement. &#160;

Operating expenses &#160;

were higher &#160;

by $38.3 &#160;

million principally 

due to higher personnel costs, business promotion &#160;

expenses, &#160;

and higher processing and transactional &#160;

expenses. 

&#9679;

&#160;

Total &#160;

assets at March 31, 2023 amounted to $67.7 billion, compared to &#160;

$67.6 billion, at December 31, 2022. The increase was 

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

money &#160;

market &#160;

investments, &#160;

loans, &#160;

and &#160;

debt &#160;

securities &#160;

held-to-maturity, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

debt 

securities available-for-sale and other assets. 

&#9679;

Total &#160;

deposits at March 31, &#160;

2023 decreased by $273.3 million &#160;

when compared to deposits &#160;

at December 31, 2022, mainly &#160;

due 

to lower Puerto Rico public sector deposits by $0.4 billion &#160;

and lower interest bearing retail deposits at &#160;

BPPR.

&#9679;

&#160;

Stockholders&#8217; equity &#160;

totaled $4.5 &#160;

billion at &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, an &#160;

increase of &#160;

$377.3 million &#160;

when compared &#160;

to &#160;

December 31, 

2022, &#160;

principally &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

net &#160;

income &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

$159.0 &#160;

million, &#160;

the &#160;

after-tax &#160;

impact &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

favorable &#160;

variance &#160;

in &#160;

net 

unrealized losses in the portfolio of available-for-sale securities of $191.8 million, the amortization of the unrealized losses from 

securities &#160;

reclassified to &#160;

held-to-maturity as &#160;

described below &#160;

of &#160;

$33.6 million, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

adoption of &#160;

the &#160;

new &#160;

ASU &#160;

during the 

quarter of $28.8 million, partially offset by dividends &#160;

declared for the quarter. 

&#9679;

&#160;

At March 31, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book value per common share was $50.15, an increase of $5.18 from December 

31, 2022 due mainly to the increase in Stockholders&#8217; &#160;

equity during the period. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Capital ratios continued to &#160;

be strong. As &#160;

of March 31, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s common equity &#160;

tier 1 capital &#160;

ratio was 16.73%, 

the tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.47%, and the total &#160;

capital ratio was 18.61%. Refer to Table 8 for capital ratios.

within this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

additional discussion &#160;

of significant 

quarterly variances and items impacting the financial performance &#160;

of the Corporation. 

As a financial services company, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected &#160;

by general business and economic conditions 

in the &#160;

markets which &#160;

we serve. &#160;

Lending and &#160;

deposit activities &#160;

and fee &#160;

income generation &#160;

are influenced &#160;

by the &#160;

level of &#160;

business 

spending and &#160;

investment, consumer &#160;

income, spending &#160;

and savings, &#160;

capital market &#160;

activities, competition, &#160;

customer preferences, 

interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates &#160;

on competing products. 

The Corporation &#160;

operates in &#160;

a highly &#160;

regulated environment &#160;

and may &#160;

be adversely &#160;

affected by &#160;

changes in &#160;

federal and &#160;

local laws 

and regulations. Also, competition with other financial institutions &#160;

could adversely affect its profitability. 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

continuously &#160;

monitors &#160;

general &#160;

business &#160;

and &#160;

economic &#160;

conditions, &#160;

industry-related &#160;

indicators &#160;

and &#160;

trends, 

competition, interest rate volatility, credit &#160;

quality indicators, loan and deposit demand, operational and systems efficiencies, revenue 

enhancements and changes in the regulation of financial &#160;

services companies. &#160;

The description of the Corporation&#8217;s business contained in &#160;

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES &#160;

The accounting &#160;

and reporting &#160;

policies followed &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation and &#160;

its subsidiaries &#160;

conform to &#160;

generally accepted &#160;

accounting 

principles &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States &#160;

of &#160;

America &#160;

and &#160;

general &#160;

practices &#160;

within &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

services &#160;

industry. &#160;

Various &#160;

elements &#160;

of &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by &#160;

their nature, are &#160;

inherently subject to &#160;

estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and &#160;

other 

subjective assessments. &#160;

These estimates &#160;

are made &#160;

under facts &#160;

and circumstances &#160;

at a &#160;

point in &#160;

time and &#160;

changes in &#160;

those facts 

and circumstances could produce actual results that &#160;

differ from those estimates. &#160;

Management has discussed &#160;

the development and &#160;

selection of the &#160;

critical accounting policies &#160;

and estimates with &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s 

Audit &#160;

Committee. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

identified &#160;

as &#160;

critical &#160;

accounting &#160;

policies &#160;

those &#160;

related &#160;

to: &#160;

(i) &#160;

Fair &#160;

Value &#160;

Measurement &#160;

of 

Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans &#160;

and Allowance for Credit &#160;

Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired &#160;

with Deteriorated Credit Quality; &#160;

(iv) Income 

Taxes; &#160;

(v) Goodwill and &#160;

Other Intangible Assets; and &#160;

(vi) Pension and Postretirement &#160;

Benefit Obligations. For a &#160;

summary of these 

critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to that particular section in &#160;

the MD&#38;A included in the 2022 Form &#160;

10-K. Also, refer to

Financial Statements &#160;

included in &#160;

the 2022 &#160;

Form 10-K &#160;

for a &#160;

summary of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

significant 

accounting policies and &#160;

to Note &#160;

3 to &#160;

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest &#160;

income for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2023 &#160;

was $531.7 &#160;

million, compared &#160;

to $494.3 &#160;

million in &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of 

2022, an increase of $37.3 million. Net &#160;

interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for &#160;

the first quarter of 2023 was $570.4 million 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$548.1 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2022, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$22.3 &#160;

million. &#160;

The &#160;

lower &#160;

positive &#160;

variance &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

taxable 

equivalent &#160;

net &#160;

interest income &#160;

as compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

GAAP &#160;

net interest &#160;

income &#160;

is &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

a &#160;

higher &#160;

effective &#160;

tax &#160;

during the &#160;

first 

quarter of 2023 due to a higher disallowed interest expense as a result of the increase in the Corporation&#8217;s cost of deposits. Refer to 

the Income taxes discussion for further information. &#160;

Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.22% compared to 2.75% in the first quarter of 2022 or an increase of 47 basis points. On a 

taxable equivalent basis, &#160;

net interest margin &#160;

for the first &#160;

quarter of 2023, &#160;

was 3.46%, compared &#160;

to 3.05% for &#160;

the same quarter &#160;

the 

prior year. The main variances in net interest income on a taxable &#160;

equivalent basis were: 

&#9679;

Higher interest &#160;

income from &#160;

money market, &#160;

investment and &#160;

trading securities &#160;

by $80.1 &#160;

million driven &#160;

by higher &#160;

average 

yield &#160;

by 128 &#160;

basis points, &#160;

related to &#160;

a &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate environment, &#160;

partially offset &#160;

by lower &#160;

volume by &#160;

$8.7 billion 

linked to a lower volume &#160;

of &#160;

the Puerto Rico public sector deposits &#160;

at BPPR, as a &#160;

result of the payments made by &#160;

Puerto 

Rico pursuant &#160;

to the &#160;

Plan of &#160;

Adjustment for &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

under Title &#160;

III of &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico Oversight, &#160;

Management, and 

Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) which became &#160;

effective on March 15, 2022 and the increase in &#160;

loan volume; 

&#9679;

higher interest income &#160;

from loans &#160;

by $114.1 &#160;

million resulting from &#160;

an increase &#160;

in average loans &#160;

by $2.8 &#160;

billion reflecting 

increases &#160;

in &#160;

both &#160;

PB &#160;

and &#160;

Banco &#160;

Popular &#160;

de &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

(&#8220;BPPR&#8221;) &#160;

and &#160;

across &#160;

most &#160;

major &#160;

lending &#160;

segments. &#160;

Loan 

origination in &#160;

a higher &#160;

interest rate &#160;

environment and &#160;

the repricing &#160;

of &#160;

adjustable-rate loans &#160;

resulted in &#160;

a higher &#160;

yield on 

loans by 91 basis points. &#160;

The categories with the highest impact &#160;

were commercial loans with an increase of &#160;

$73.3 million 

in interest income, or 124 basis points, and consumer loans which increased $25.7 million in interest income, or 165 basis 

points. &#160;

Partially offset by: 

&#9679;

higher interest expense &#160;

on deposits by &#160;

$168.4 million due &#160;

to the increase &#160;

in rates, mainly &#160;

from Puerto Rico &#160;

government, 

commercial &#160;

deposits &#160;

and &#160;

Popular &#160;

Bank &#160;

(&#8220;PB&#8221;) &#160;

deposits, &#160;

partially &#160;

offset &#160;

by &#160;

lower &#160;

volume &#160;

of &#160;

average &#160;

interest-bearing 

deposits by $6.0 billion mainly related to the &#160;

decrease on Puerto Rico government deposits, accounting for approximately 

75% of the decrease in volume; 

Net interest income for the BPPR segment amounted to $449.8 &#160;

million for the first quarter of 2023, compared &#160;

to $415.2 million in the 

first quarter &#160;

of 2022. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin increased &#160;

to 3.24% &#160;

compared to &#160;

2.67% in &#160;

the first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2022. The &#160;

increase in &#160;

net 

interest income &#160;

of $34.7 &#160;

million was &#160;

driven by &#160;

a higher &#160;

volume on &#160;

loans and &#160;

a higher &#160;

yield on &#160;

earning assets &#160;

related to &#160;

a higher 

interest rate environment, partially offset &#160;

by the increase in the &#160;

cost of deposits, mainly from &#160;

the P.R. &#160;

public sector and commercial 

interest-bearing deposits. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 145 basis points to 1.61% from 0.16% in the &#160;

same quarter 

of 2022. Total deposit cost for the quarter increased by 106 basis points, from 0.12% &#160;

in the first quarter of 2022 to 1.18%. 

Net &#160;

interest &#160;

income &#160;

for &#160;

PB &#160;

was &#160;

$90.1 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter &#160;

ended &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

$86.5 &#160;

million &#160;

during &#160;

the &#160;

first 

quarter of &#160;

2022, an &#160;

increase of &#160;

$3.6 million. &#160;

Net interest &#160;

margin decreased &#160;

22 basis &#160;

points when &#160;

compared to &#160;

the first &#160;

quarter of 

2022 to 3.56%. The decrease in net interest margin was mostly driven by a higher cost of deposits, partially offset by the increase in 

loan volume and the &#160;

repricing of adjustable-rate loans driven &#160;

by the changes in interest &#160;

rates. The cost of &#160;

interest-bearing deposits 

was 2.47% &#160;

compared to &#160;

0.46%, or &#160;

an increase &#160;

of 201 &#160;

basis points, while &#160;

total deposit cost &#160;

was 2.01% compared &#160;

to 0.36% &#160;

in the 

first quarter of 2022.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio &#160;

and Unfunded Commitments 

For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Corporation recorded an &#160;

expense of $47.8 million for its reserve for credit losses &#160;

related 

to &#160;

loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

unfunded &#160;

commitments. &#160;

The &#160;

provision &#160;

for &#160;

credit &#160;

loss &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

loans-held-in-portfolio &#160;

for &#160;

the 

quarter ended March 31, 2023 &#160;

was $47.1 million, compared to the &#160;

reserve release of $14.4 million for &#160;

the quarter ended March 31, 

2022. The provision &#160;

expense was mainly driven &#160;

by reductions in &#160;

the HPI forecast, &#160;

higher loan volumes &#160;

and migration of consumer 

credit scores. &#160;

The first quarter of 2022 also included releases of ACL reserves originally related to &#160;

COVID-19 economic uncertainty. 

The &#160;

provision &#160;

related &#160;

to &#160;

unfunded commitments &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023 &#160;

was &#160;

$0.6 &#160;

million, &#160;

compared &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

reserve &#160;

release 

related to unfunded commitments of $0.8 million for the &#160;

same period of 2022. &#160;

For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Corporation recorded a provision for credit loss of $45.2 million for loans-held-in-portfolio 

for the &#160;

BPPR segment, &#160;

compared to &#160;

a reserve &#160;

release of &#160;

$12.7 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2022. The &#160;

Popular U.S. 

segment recorded a provision of $1.9 million &#160;

for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to &#160;

a reserve release of $1.7 million for 

the same quarter in 2022. &#160;

At March 31, &#160;

2023, the total &#160;

allowance for credit &#160;

losses for loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio amounted to &#160;

$689.1 million, compared &#160;

to $720.3 

million as of December 31, 2022. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses &#160;

to loans held-in-portfolio was 2.13% at March 31, 2023, 

compared &#160;

to &#160;

2.25% &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

During &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation adopted &#160;

ASU &#160;

2022-02 &#160;

which &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

a 

reduction of approximately $46 million, $29 million net of tax, in the reserve related to &#160;

TDR which was recorded as an adjustment to 

the beginning balance of retained earnings. &#160;

As discussed in Note 9 to &#160;

the Consolidated Financial Statements, within the process &#160;

to 

estimate its &#160;

ACL, the &#160;

Corporation applies probability &#160;

weightings to the &#160;

outcomes of simulations &#160;

using Moody&#8217;s Analytics&#8217; &#160;

Baseline, 

S3 (pessimistic) and S1 (optimistic) scenarios. The baseline scenario is assigned the highest probability, followed by the pessimistic 

scenario &#160;

given &#160;

Non-Interest Income 

Non-interest &#160;

income &#160;

was &#160;

$162.0 million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter of &#160;

2023, &#160;

an &#160;

increase &#160;

of &#160;

$7.3 &#160;

million &#160;

when compared &#160;

with &#160;

the &#160;

same 

quarter of the previous year. The increase in non-interest income was primarily &#160;

driven by: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other service fees &#160;

by $12.9 million mainly &#160;

due to higher credit card &#160;

fees by $6.9 million &#160;

and higher debit card fees 

by $1.4 million as a result of higher interchange transactional volumes &#160;

and higher other fees by $4.4 million mainly due to 

the merchant &#160;

business fees &#160;

as a &#160;

result of &#160;

the revenue &#160;

sharing agreement &#160;

entered into &#160;

with Evertec, &#160;

Inc. on &#160;

July 2022; 

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

a favorable &#160;

variance in &#160;

unrealized net &#160;

gains on &#160;

equity securities &#160;

by $3.2 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

on deferred &#160;

compensation plans 

that have an offsetting expense in personnel related expenses. 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower service &#160;

charges on &#160;

deposit accounts &#160;

by $6.0 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

as &#160;

a &#160;

result of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

initiative of &#160;

reducing 

overdraft fees implemented in the third quarter of 2022; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income from mortgage banking activities by $5.5 million mainly due to an unfavorable variance of &#160;

$2.5 million in the 

fair value adjustment &#160;

of mortgage servicing &#160;

rights and lower &#160;

net gains on &#160;

closed derivative positions, partially &#160;

offset by a 

positive variance of $1.8 million in net gains (losses) &#160;

on the sale and valuation adjustments of mortgage &#160;

loans. &#160;

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses &#160;

for the &#160;

increased by &#160;

$38.3 million &#160;

when compared &#160;

with the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter of 

2022, driven primarily by: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher &#160;

personnel &#160;

cost &#160;

by &#160;

$31.8 &#160;

million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher &#160;

salaries &#160;

by &#160;

$26.7 &#160;

million &#160;

as &#160;

and higher &#160;

payroll taxes &#160;

and fringe &#160;

benefits by &#160;

$6.8 million; &#160;

partially 

offset by a decrease in profit-sharing accrual of $4.2 &#160;

million; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher business promotion expenses by $3.8 million &#160;

mainly due to higher credit cards rewards expense; &#160;

and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher processing &#160;

and transactional expenses &#160;

by $3.0 &#160;

million mainly due &#160;

to higher &#160;

merchant processing and &#160;

credit card 

processing expenses as a result of higher &#160;

transactional volumes; 

partially offset by: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Income Taxes 

For the &#160;

quarter ended March &#160;

31, 2023, the &#160;

corporation recorded an &#160;

income tax &#160;

expense of $46.3 &#160;

million with &#160;

an effective tax &#160;

rate 

(ETR) of 23%, compared to $50.5 &#160;

million with an ETR of &#160;

19% for the same period &#160;

of 2022. The income tax expense for &#160;

the quarter 

ended March 31, &#160;

2023, reflects the &#160;

impact of lower &#160;

pre-tax income, a reversal &#160;

of a valuation &#160;

allowance on a &#160;

tax credit expected to 

be realized on the &#160;

U. S. operations as &#160;

a result of the &#160;

implementation of the Corporate Alternative Minimum &#160;

Tax, &#160;

and lower benefits 

on the exempt income mainly due to higher &#160;

allocation of interest expense disallowance. 

At &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, the &#160;

Corporation had &#160;

a net &#160;

deferred tax &#160;

asset amounting &#160;

to &#160;

$0.9 billion, &#160;

net of &#160;

a valuation &#160;

allowance of &#160;

$0.5 

billion. The net deferred tax asset related to the U.S. &#160;

operations was $0.3 billion, net of a valuation &#160;

allowance of $0.4 billion. 

The Inflation &#160;

Reduction Act of &#160;

2022 imposed &#160;

a new &#160;

corporate alternative minimum &#160;

tax (&#8220;AMT&#8221;), &#160;

effective for &#160;

taxable year &#160;

2023, to 

corporations that meet a dual three-year average adjusted financial statement income (&#8220;AFSI&#8221;) &#160;

threshold of $1 billion on a worldwide 

basis and $100 &#160;

million for its &#160;

U.S. operations. &#160;

The AFSI is, &#160;

in general, the &#160;

GAAP net income &#160;

per financial statements &#160;

with certain 

adjustments, &#160;

including foreign &#160;

taxes &#160;

and &#160;

tax &#160;

depreciation. As &#160;

of &#160;

January 1, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation met &#160;

this &#160;

dual threshold. &#160;

The 

implementation of the AMT &#160;

will not have &#160;

a material impact in &#160;

the Corporation, since any &#160;

amount paid would be &#160;

recorded as a &#160;

DTA 

with no expiration period. 

Refer to &#160;

tax rate &#160;

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

reportable segments &#160;

for managerial &#160;

reporting purposes &#160;

consist of &#160;

Banco Popular &#160;

de Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

Popular 

U.S. A Corporate group &#160;

has been defined to support the reportable &#160;

segments. &#160;

&#160;

For &#160;

a &#160;

description &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

additional &#160;

financial &#160;

information &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

underlying 

management accounting process, refer to Note 33 &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

The Corporate &#160;

group reported a &#160;

net income &#160;

of $1.3 &#160;

million for &#160;

the quarter &#160;

ended March &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

compared with &#160;

a net &#160;

income of 

$6.3 million for &#160;

the same &#160;

quarter of the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

The decrease in &#160;

net income was &#160;

mainly attributed to &#160;

an $8.1 million &#160;

amounted to &#160;

$132.9 million &#160;

for the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March 31, 

2023, &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

net &#160;

income &#160;

of &#160;

$178.5 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the &#160;

previous year. &#160;

The &#160;

decrease &#160;

in &#160;

net &#160;

income &#160;

was 

principally driven by the following: &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $34.7 million mainly &#160;

due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment &#160;

securities by $92.5 million due to higher yields driven 

by the increase in interest rates and higher average &#160;

balances of U.S. Treasury securities. 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by $77.9 million mainly &#160;

due to higher average balances from commercial and 

consumer loans, mainly from credit cards and personal &#160;

loans. 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest expense on deposits by &#160;

$135.5 million mainly due to higher &#160;

costs on the market-indexed Puerto 

Rico &#160;

government &#160;

deposits, &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rate &#160;

environment&#8217;s &#160;

impact on &#160;

the cost &#160;

of &#160;

NOW accounts, 

time deposits, and savings deposits. 

The &#160;

net interest &#160;

margin &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

quarter ended &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023 &#160;

was &#160;

3.24% &#160;

compared to &#160;

2.67% for &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter in &#160;

the 

previous year. The &#160;

increase in net interest margin is &#160;

driven by higher yields from investments securities &#160;

and loans, particularly 

commercial and consumer loans, due to the increase &#160;

in rates; &#160;

partially offset by higher cost of deposits.

$45.7 million, &#160;

of &#160;

$13.7 million &#160;

in &#160;

quarter ended 

March 31, 2022, &#160;

or an unfavorable &#160;

variance of $59.4 &#160;

million as the &#160;

2022 results included &#160;

a release of &#160;

COVID-19 related 

reserves; 

&#9679;

&#160;

Non-interest income was higher by $11.4 million mainly due to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher other service fees by $12.7 million mainly due to higher credit card fees as a result of higher interchange 

transactional volumes; &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher other &#160;

operating income &#160;

by $6.7 &#160;

million mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

an insurance &#160;

policy reimbursement &#160;

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

lower income &#160;

from mortgage &#160;

banking activities &#160;

by $5.2 &#160;

million mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

an unfavorable &#160;

variance of &#160;

$2.2 

million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service rights and lower &#160;

net gains on closed derivative positions, 

partially offset by a &#160;

positive variance of $1.8 million &#160;

in net gains (losses) on &#160;

the sale and valuation &#160;

adjustments 

of mortgage loans. &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $28.8 million mostly due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel &#160;

costs by &#160;

$21.5 million &#160;

driven by &#160;

higher salaries &#160;

due to &#160;

minimum salary &#160;

adjustments, market 

adjustments, annual salary &#160;

revisions, &#160;

and increase in headcount;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

For the &#160;

quarter ended March &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

the reportable &#160;

segment of &#160;

Popular U.S. &#160;

reported a &#160;

net income &#160;

of $25.0 &#160;

million, compared 

with &#160;

a &#160;

net income &#160;

of &#160;

$27.0 million &#160;

for the &#160;

same &#160;

quarter of &#160;

the previous &#160;

year. &#160;

The &#160;

factors that &#160;

contributed to &#160;

the variance &#160;

in the 

financial results included the following: 

&#9679;

&#160;

Higher net interest income by $3.6 million due &#160;

to: 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from loans by &#160;

$36.5 million, mainly from growth in the commercial &#160;

portfolio loans as well 

as higher yields due to increase in rates; and 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest income from money market and investment securities &#160;

by $6.3 million due to higher yields &#160;

due to 

the increase in market rates; 

partially offset by 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher interest &#160;

expense on &#160;

deposits by &#160;

$37.4 million &#160;

mainly &#160;

due &#160;

to &#160;

higher interest &#160;

rates &#160;

and &#160;

higher average 

balance of time deposits. &#160;

The net interest &#160;

margin for the &#160;

quarter ended March 31, &#160;

2023 was 3.34% compared &#160;

to 3.56% for &#160;

the same quarter in &#160;

the previous 

year. 

&#9679;

&#160;

An unfavorable variance of $4.1 million &#160;

&#160;

Higher operating expenses by $9.6 million mostly &#160;

due to &#160;

&#9679;

&#160;

higher personnel costs by $4.5 million due to salary &#160;

merit and market adjustments; 

&#9679;

&#160;

higher other &#160;

FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS &#160;

Assets 

The Corporation&#8217;s total &#160;

assets were $67.7 billion &#160;

at March 31, &#160;

2023, compared to $67.6 &#160;

billion at December 31, &#160;

2022. Refer to the 

Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition included &#160;

in this report for additional information. &#160;

Money market investments and debt securities available-for-sale 

Money market investments increased by $483.7 million due mainly to an increase in overnight FED fund balances of &#160;

$483.1 million, 

reflecting &#160;

net funding &#160;

activities &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

issuance of &#160;

senior &#160;

notes &#160;

due &#160;

in &#160;

2028. &#160;

Debt securities &#160;

available-for-sale 

decreased $631.2 &#160;

million reflecting &#160;

repayment and &#160;

maturities, offset &#160;

by &#160;

a reduction &#160;

of $215.5 &#160;

million in &#160;

unrealized losses &#160;

mainly 

from U.S. Treasury &#160;

and mortgage-backed securities at &#160;

BPPR. Debt securities &#160;

held-to-maturity increased by &#160;

$37.8 million at &#160;

March 

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

due &#160;

mainly &#160;

Deposits 

The Corporation&#8217;s deposits &#160;

totaled $61.0 billion &#160;

at March 31, &#160;

2023, compared to &#160;

$61.2 billion at &#160;

December 31, 2022. &#160;

The deposits 

decrease of $273.3 &#160;

million was mainly &#160;

in public sector &#160;

accounts as well &#160;

as interest bearing &#160;

retail deposits at &#160;

BPPR, partially offset 

by an &#160;

increase at &#160;

PB, mainly from &#160;

time and &#160;

savings deposits gathered &#160;

through its &#160;

direct channel. At &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, Puerto Rico 

public sector deposits amounted &#160;

to $15.5 billion. The &#160;

rate at which public &#160;

deposit balances may change is &#160;

uncertain and difficult to 

predict. The &#160;

receipt by &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico Government &#160;

of additional &#160;

hurricane recovery &#160;

related Federal &#160;

assistance and &#160;

seasonal tax 

collections, could increase public deposit balances at BPPR in the &#160;

near term. The amount and timing of any reduction is &#160;

likely to be 

impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for &#160;

example, &#160;

the &#160;

speed &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

federal &#160;

assistance &#160;

is &#160;

distributed, &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

condition, &#160;

liquidity &#160;

and &#160;

cash 

management &#160;

practices &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Government &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

instrumentalities &#160;

and &#160;

the &#160;

implementation &#160;

of &#160;

fiscal &#160;

and &#160;

debt 

adjustment plans approved &#160;

pursuant to PROMESA &#160;

or other actions &#160;

mandated by the &#160;

Fiscal Oversight and &#160;

Management Board for 

Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;). &#160;

Approximately 25% of &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

deposits are public &#160;

fund deposits from &#160;

the Government of &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

municipalities and 

government instrumentalities &#160;

and corporations. &#160;

These deposits &#160;

are indexed &#160;

to &#160;

short-term market &#160;

rates and &#160;

fluctuate in &#160;

cost &#160;

with 

changes &#160;

in &#160;

those &#160;

rates &#160;

with &#160;

a &#160;

one-quarter &#160;

lag, &#160;

in &#160;

accordance &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

terms. &#160;

As &#160;

a &#160;

result, &#160;

these &#160;

deposits&#8217; &#160;

costs &#160;

have 

generally lagged &#160;

variable asset &#160;

repricing. Generally, &#160;

these &#160;

deposits require &#160;

that the &#160;

bank pledge &#160;

high credit &#160;

quality securities &#160;

as 

collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising &#160;

from public sector deposit outflows &#160;

are lower. &#160;

REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Corporation, BPPR and PB &#160;

are subject to regulatory capital &#160;

requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. &#160;

The risk-

based &#160;

capital &#160;

standards &#160;

applicable &#160;

to &#160;

and &#160;

PB &#160;

(&#8220;Basel &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

final &#160;

capital 

framework for strengthening international capital standards, known &#160;

as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. &#160;

As 

of March 31, 2023, the Corporation&#8217;s, BPPR&#8217;s and &#160;

PB&#8217;s capital ratios continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#160;

&#8220;well-

a depository institution will be deemed to be &#160;

well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio &#160;

of 

at least 5%, a common equity Tier &#160;

Tier 1 capital ratio of &#160;

at least 8% and a total risk-based &#160;

has determined &#160;

that &#160;

as of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

provided in &#160;

the &#160;

final &#160;

regulatory capital &#160;

rules effective &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2020. &#160;

The &#160;

five-year &#160;

period provision delays for two &#160;

years the estimated impact &#160;

delay. &#160;

As &#160;

of &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the 

Corporation had phased-in 50% of &#160;

the cumulative CECL deferral with &#160;

the remaining impact to &#160;

be recognized over the &#160;

remainder of 

the three-year transition period. 

On April 9, &#160;

2020, federal banking regulators &#160;

issued an interim final &#160;

rule to modify &#160;

the Basel III &#160;

regulatory capital rules applicable &#160;

to 

banking organizations to allow &#160;

those organizations participating in &#160;

the Paycheck Protection Program &#160;

(&#8220;PPP&#8221;) established under the 

Coronavirus Aid, Relief &#160;

and Economic Security &#160;

Act (the &#160;

&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) to &#160;

neutralize the regulatory &#160;

capital effects &#160;

of participating in 

the &#160;

program. &#160;

Specifically, &#160;

the &#160;

agencies &#160;

have &#160;

clarified &#160;

that &#160;

banking &#160;

organizations, &#160;

including &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

Bank 

subsidiaries, are permitted to &#160;

assign a zero &#160;

percent risk weight to &#160;

PPP loans for &#160;

purposes of determining risk-weighted &#160;

assets and 

risk-based &#160;

capital &#160;

ratios. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

in &#160;

order &#160;

to &#160;

facilitate &#160;

use &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Paycheck &#160;

Protection &#160;

Program &#160;

Liquidity &#160;

Facility &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;PPPL 

Facility&#8221;), which provides Federal Reserve Bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the Corporation&#8217;s Bank subsidiaries to 

fund PPP loans, the &#160;

agencies further clarified that, &#160;

for purposes of determining &#160;

leverage ratios, a banking &#160;

organization is permitted 

to exclude from total average assets PPP loans that &#160;

have been pledged as collateral for a PPPL &#160;

Facility. As of March &#160;

31, 2023, the 

Corporation has $27 million in PPP loans and no &#160;

loans were pledge as collateral for PPPL Facilities. 

The increase in the common equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio, and total capital ratio as of March &#160;

31, 2023 as compared to 

December 31, &#160;

2022 was &#160;

mainly to &#160;

the period &#160;

earnings. &#160;

The increase &#160;

in leverage &#160;

capital ratio &#160;

was mainly &#160;

due to &#160;

the decrease &#160;

in 

average total assets, which mostly did not have &#160;

a significant impact on the risk-weighted assets. 

Non-GAAP financial measures

stock &#160;

analysts &#160;

use &#160;

the &#160;

tangible &#160;

common 

equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in &#160;

conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare &#160;

the capital 

adequacy of banking organizations with significant &#160;

amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, &#160;

typically stemming from the use of 

the &#160;

purchase &#160;

method &#160;

mergers &#160;

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the &#160;

Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest &#160;

rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk &#160;

refers to the &#160;

risk of a &#160;

reduction in the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s capital due &#160;

to changes in &#160;

the market valuation &#160;

of its assets &#160;

and/or 

liabilities. &#160;

Most of the assets &#160;

subject to market valuation risk &#160;

are debt securities classified as &#160;

available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 &#160;

and 7 to the 

Consolidated Financial &#160;

Statements for &#160;

further information &#160;

on the &#160;

debt &#160;

securities available-for-sale &#160;

and &#160;

held-to-maturity portfolios. 

Debt securities classified &#160;

as available-for-sale amounted to &#160;

$17.2 billion as &#160;

of March 31, &#160;

2023. Other assets subject &#160;

to market risk 

include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $11 &#160;

million, mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $127 &#160;

million and 

securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted &#160;

to $30 million, as of March 31, 2023. &#160;

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject &#160;

to various categories of interest rate risk, &#160;

including repricing, basis, yield curve and 

option risks. &#160;

In managing &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk, management may &#160;

alter the &#160;

mix of &#160;

floating and &#160;

fixed rate &#160;

assets and &#160;

liabilities, change 

pricing &#160;

schedules, &#160;

adjust &#160;

maturities &#160;

through &#160;

sales &#160;

and &#160;

purchases &#160;

of &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

and &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

derivative &#160;

contracts, 

among other alternatives. &#160;

Interest &#160;

rate &#160;

risk &#160;

management &#160;

is &#160;

an &#160;

active &#160;

process &#160;

that &#160;

encompasses &#160;

monitoring &#160;

loan &#160;

and &#160;

deposit &#160;

flows &#160;

complemented &#160;

by 

investment and funding &#160;

activities. Effective management of &#160;

interest rate risk begins &#160;

with understanding the dynamic &#160;

characteristics 

of assets and &#160;

liabilities and determining the &#160;

appropriate rate risk position &#160;

given line of &#160;

business forecasts, management objectives, 

market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest &#160;

Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 

Economic Value &#160;

of Equity &#160;

(&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The &#160;

three methodologies &#160;

complement each &#160;

other and &#160;

are used &#160;

jointly in &#160;

the evaluation &#160;

of the 

Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII &#160;

simulation modeling is &#160;

prepared for a &#160;

five-year period, which &#160;

in conjunction with &#160;

the EVE analysis, &#160;

provides 

management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest &#160;

income simulation analysis &#160;

performed by legal &#160;

entity and on &#160;

a consolidated basis &#160;

is a &#160;

tool used &#160;

by the &#160;

Corporation in 

estimating the &#160;

potential change &#160;

in net &#160;

interest income &#160;

resulting from &#160;

hypothetical changes &#160;

in interest &#160;

rates. Sensitivity &#160;

analysis is 

calculated using a simulation model which incorporates &#160;

actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity &#160;

and interest yields or costs. &#160;

Management assesses &#160;

interest rate &#160;

risk by &#160;

comparing various &#160;

NII simulations &#160;

under different &#160;

interest rate &#160;

scenarios that &#160;

differ in 

direction of interest &#160;

rate changes, the &#160;

degree of change &#160;

and the projected &#160;

shape of the &#160;

yield curve. For &#160;

example, the types &#160;

of rate 

scenarios processed during the &#160;

quarter include flat &#160;

rates, implied forwards, and &#160;

parallel and non-parallel rate &#160;

shocks. Management 

also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis &#160;

and prepayment risk exposures. &#160;

The asset &#160;

and liability &#160;

management group &#160;

performs validation &#160;

procedures on &#160;

various assumptions &#160;

used as &#160;

part of &#160;

the simulation 

analyses as well as validations &#160;

of results on a &#160;

monthly basis. In addition, the &#160;

model and processes used to &#160;

assess IRR are subject 

to independent validations according to the guidelines &#160;

established in the Model Governance and &#160;

Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII &#160;

simulations under interest rate &#160;

scenarios in which the &#160;

yield curve is assumed &#160;

to rise and &#160;

decline by 

the same &#160;

magnitude (parallel &#160;

shifts). The &#160;

rate scenarios &#160;

considered in &#160;

these market &#160;

risk simulations &#160;

reflect instantaneous &#160;

parallel 

changes &#160;

of &#160;

-100, &#160;

-200, &#160;

+100, &#160;

+200 &#160;

and &#160;

+400 &#160;

basis &#160;

points &#160;

during the &#160;

succeeding &#160;

twelve-month period. &#160;

Simulation &#160;

analyses &#160;

are 

based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points &#160;

and indexes, interest rate 

spreads, loan prepayments &#160;

and deposit elasticity. &#160;

Thus, they should &#160;

not be &#160;

relied upon as &#160;

indicative of actual &#160;

results. Further, &#160;

the 

estimates &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

contemplate &#160;

actions &#160;

that &#160;

management &#160;

could &#160;

take &#160;

to &#160;

respond &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

interest &#160;

rates. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the 

Corporation is also subject to &#160;

basis risk in the &#160;

repricing of its assets and &#160;

liabilities, including the basis related &#160;

to using different rate 

indexes for &#160;

the repricing &#160;

of assets and &#160;

liabilities, as &#160;

well as &#160;

the effect &#160;

of pricing &#160;

lags which &#160;

may be &#160;

contractual or &#160;

due to &#160;

historical 

differences &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

management &#160;

responses &#160;

to &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

rate &#160;

environment. &#160;

By &#160;

their &#160;

nature, &#160;

these &#160;

forward-looking 

computations are only &#160;

estimates and may &#160;

be different from &#160;

what may actually &#160;

occur in the &#160;

future. The following &#160;

table presents the 

results of the simulations at March 31, 2023 and December &#160;

31, 2022, assuming a static balance sheet &#160;

and parallel changes over flat

As of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, NII &#160;

simulations show &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has a &#160;

relatively neutral &#160;

sensitivity position &#160;

as compared &#160;

to a &#160;

slightly 

liability sensitive position as of December 31, 2022. The primary reasons for the variation in sensitivity are changes in balance sheet 

composition that &#160;

include &#160;

a &#160;

decrease in &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

public sector &#160;

deposits &#160;

which &#160;

are &#160;

indexed &#160;

to &#160;

market &#160;

rates &#160;

combined &#160;

with &#160;

an 

increase in time &#160;

deposits, as well &#160;

as loan growth &#160;

and maturities of &#160;

investments. These results suggest &#160;

that changes in &#160;

net interest 

income are driven primarily by changes in liability costs, primarily &#160;

Puerto Rico public sector deposits that represented $15.5 billion &#160;

or 

25% &#160;

of &#160;

deposits &#160;

as &#160;

of &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

and &#160;

partly &#160;

by &#160;

portfolio &#160;

management &#160;

strategies. &#160;

In &#160;

declining &#160;

rate &#160;

scenarios &#160;

net &#160;

interest 

income would increase as &#160;

the decline in the &#160;

cost of these deposits &#160;

generates a greater benefit &#160;

than the changes in &#160;

asset yields. In 

rising rate scenarios Popular&#8217;s sensitivity profile &#160;

is also impacted by its &#160;

large proportion of Puerto Rico &#160;

public sector deposits which 

are indexed to market rates. As short-term rates have &#160;

risen, the cost of these deposits now increases in &#160;

sync with market rates and 

therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in &#160;

rising rate environments. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

loan and &#160;

investment portfolios &#160;

are subject &#160;

to &#160;

prepayment risk, &#160;

which results &#160;

from the &#160;

ability of &#160;

a third-party &#160;

to 

repay debt &#160;

obligations prior &#160;

to maturity. &#160;

Prepayment risk &#160;

also could &#160;

have a &#160;

significant impact &#160;

on the &#160;

duration of &#160;

mortgage-backed 

securities &#160;

and &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

since &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

shorten &#160;

(or &#160;

lower &#160;

prepayments &#160;

could &#160;

extend) &#160;

the 

weighted average life of these portfolios.

Trading &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

engages in &#160;

trading activities &#160;

in the &#160;

ordinary course &#160;

of business &#160;

at its &#160;

subsidiaries, BPPR &#160;

and Popular &#160;

Securities. 

Popular Securities&#8217; &#160;

trading activities &#160;

consist primarily &#160;

of market-making &#160;

activities to &#160;

meet expected &#160;

customers&#8217; needs &#160;

related to &#160;

its 

retail brokerage business, &#160;

and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and &#160;

government sponsored securities with the objective of 

realizing gains &#160;

from expected &#160;

short-term price &#160;

movements. BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

trading activities consist &#160;

primarily of &#160;

holding U.S. &#160;

Government 

sponsored &#160;

mortgage-backed securities &#160;

classified &#160;

as &#160;

&#8220;trading&#8221; and &#160;

hedging &#160;

the &#160;

related &#160;

market &#160;

risk &#160;

with &#160;

&#8220;TBA&#8221; &#160;

(to-be-announced) 

market &#160;

transactions. &#160;

The &#160;

objective &#160;

is &#160;

to &#160;

derive &#160;

spread &#160;

income &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

portfolio &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

to &#160;

benefit &#160;

from &#160;

short-term &#160;

market 

movements. In &#160;

addition, BPPR &#160;

uses forward &#160;

contracts or &#160;

TBAs to &#160;

hedge its &#160;

securitization pipeline. &#160;

Risks related &#160;

to variations &#160;

in 

interest rates &#160;

and market volatility &#160;

are hedged &#160;

with TBAs &#160;

that have &#160;

characteristics similar to &#160;

that of &#160;

the forecasted security &#160;

and its 

conversion timeline. 

At March 31, &#160;

2023, the Corporation held trading &#160;

securities with a fair &#160;

value of $30 &#160;

million, representing approximately 0.04% of &#160;

the 

Corporation&#8217;s total &#160;

assets, &#160;

compared with &#160;

$28 million &#160;

and 0.04%, &#160;

respectively, &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2022. &#160;

As shown &#160;

in Table &#160;

11, &#160;

the 

trading portfolio consists &#160;

principally of mortgage-backed &#160;

securities and U.S. &#160;

Treasuries, which &#160;

at March &#160;

31, 2023 were &#160;

investment 

grade &#160;

securities. &#160;

As &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

the &#160;

trading &#160;

portfolio &#160;

also &#160;

included &#160;

$0.1 &#160;

million &#160;

in &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Trading instruments are &#160;

recognized at fair value, &#160;

with changes resulting from fluctuations &#160;

in market prices, 

interest rates or &#160;

exchange rates reported in &#160;

current period earnings. The &#160;

Corporation recognized net trading &#160;

account gain of $ &#160;

thousand and a net trading account loss of &#160;

$723 thousand, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and &#160;

had &#160;

a &#160;

There &#160;

are 

numerous assumptions &#160;

and estimates &#160;

associated with &#160;

VAR &#160;

In the opinion of management, the size and composition &#160;

of the trading portfolio does not represent &#160;

a significant source of market risk 

for the Corporation. 

Liquidity &#160;

The objective &#160;

of effective &#160;

liquidity management &#160;

is to &#160;

ensure that &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

has sufficient &#160;

liquidity to &#160;

meet all &#160;

of its &#160;

financial 

obligations, finance &#160;

expected future &#160;

growth, &#160;

fund &#160;

planned capital &#160;

distributions and &#160;

maintain a &#160;

reasonable safety &#160;

margin for &#160;

cash 

needs under &#160;

both normal &#160;

and stressed market &#160;

conditions. The Board &#160;

of Directors &#160;

is responsible &#160;

for establishing the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s 

tolerance for liquidity risk, &#160;

including approving relevant risk limits and &#160;

policies. The Board of &#160;

Directors has delegated the monitoring 

of &#160;

these risks &#160;

to &#160;

the Board&#8217;s &#160;

Risk Management &#160;

The &#160;

Financial and &#160;

Operational Risk &#160;

Management Division &#160;

is &#160;

responsible for &#160;

the independent &#160;

monitoring and 

reporting of adherence with established policies. 

An &#160;

institution&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

may be &#160;

pressured if, &#160;

for example, &#160;

it experiences &#160;

a sudden &#160;

and unexpected &#160;

substantial cash &#160;

outflow due 

deposit outflows &#160;

(whether due &#160;

to a &#160;

loss of &#160;

confidence by &#160;

depositors, or &#160;

other reasons) &#160;

exogenous events &#160;

such as &#160;

the COVID-19 

pandemic), a &#160;

downgrading of &#160;

rating, or &#160;

some other &#160;

event that &#160;

causes counterparties &#160;

to avoid &#160;

exposure to &#160;

the institution. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the &#160;

economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets, perceptions of 

the financial services industry and regulatory changes, &#160;

could also affect its ability to obtain funding. &#160;

The Corporation &#160;

has adopted &#160;

policies and &#160;

limits to &#160;

monitor the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s liquidity &#160;

position and &#160;

that of &#160;

its banking &#160;

subsidiaries. 

Additionally, contingency funding &#160;

plans are used to &#160;

model various stress events &#160;

of different magnitudes and &#160;

affecting different time 

horizons that assist &#160;

management in evaluating &#160;

the size of &#160;

the liquidity &#160;

buffers needed if &#160;

those stress events &#160;

occur. However, &#160;

such 

models &#160;

may &#160;

not &#160;

predict &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s borrowings, &#160;

including 

their terms, &#160;

is included &#160;

in Note &#160;

16 to &#160;

the Consolidated &#160;

Financial Statements. Also, &#160;

the Consolidated Statements &#160;

Flows in 

the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide &#160;

information on the Corporation&#8217;s cash inflows and outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Banking Subsidiaries 

Primary &#160;

sources of &#160;

funding &#160;

for the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries &#160;

(BPPR and &#160;

PB &#160;

or, &#160;

collectively, &#160;

&#8220;the banking &#160;

subsidiaries&#8221;) 

include &#160;

retail, &#160;

commercial &#160;

and &#160;

public &#160;

sector &#160;

deposits, &#160;

brokered &#160;

deposits, &#160;

unpledged &#160;

investment &#160;

securities, &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loan 

securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In &#160;

addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the 

discount window &#160;

of the &#160;

Federal Reserve &#160;

Bank of &#160;

New York &#160;

(the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) &#160;

and has &#160;

a considerable &#160;

amount of &#160;

collateral pledged &#160;

that 

can be used to raise funds under these facilities. &#160;

During the first quarter of 2023 the Corporation had &#160;

no material incremental use of its available liquidity sources. At &#160;

March 31,2023, 

the Corporation&#8217;s available liquidity &#160;

increased to $18.3 billion from &#160;

$17.0 billion on December &#160;

31, 2022. The liquidity sources &#160;

of the 

Corporation at March 31,2023 are presented in &#160;

additional &#160;

information &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

borrowing &#160;

facilities 

available through its banking subsidiaries. &#160;

The principal &#160;

uses of &#160;

funds for &#160;

the banking &#160;

subsidiaries include &#160;

loan originations, &#160;

investment portfolio &#160;

purchases, loan &#160;

purchases 

and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 

expenses. Also, the &#160;

banking subsidiaries assume liquidity &#160;

risk related to collateral &#160;

posting requirements for certain &#160;

activities mainly 

in &#160;

connection &#160;

with &#160;

contractual &#160;

commitments, &#160;

recourse &#160;

provisions, &#160;

servicing &#160;

advances, &#160;

derivatives &#160;

and &#160;

credit &#160;

card &#160;

licensing 

agreements. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries maintain &#160;

sufficient funding &#160;

capacity to &#160;

address large &#160;

increases in &#160;

funding requirements &#160;

such as &#160;

deposit 

outflows. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation has &#160;

established &#160;

liquidity &#160;

guidelines &#160;

that &#160;

require &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

to &#160;

have &#160;

sufficient &#160;

liquidity &#160;

to 

cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete &#160;

successfully in the marketplace for &#160;

deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 

factors, including pricing, service, convenience &#160;

and financial stability as &#160;

reflected by operating results and &#160;

financial condition, credit 

ratings (by &#160;

nationally recognized credit &#160;

rating agencies), customer &#160;

confidence, and &#160;

importantly, &#160;

FDIC deposit &#160;

insurance coverage. 

Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured &#160;

(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 

the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Deposits are a &#160;

key source of &#160;

funding as they &#160;

tend to be &#160;

less volatile than institutional &#160;

borrowings and their cost &#160;

is less sensitive &#160;

to 

changes in &#160;

market rates. &#160;

Refer to &#160;

Table &#160;

7 for &#160;

a breakdown &#160;

of deposits &#160;

by major &#160;

types. Core &#160;

deposits are &#160;

generated from &#160;

a large 

base &#160;

of &#160;

consumer, &#160;

corporate &#160;

and &#160;

public &#160;

sector &#160;

customers. &#160;

Core &#160;

deposits &#160;

include certificate &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

under &#160;

$250,000, &#160;

all &#160;

non-

interest bearing deposits, and &#160;

savings deposits. &#160;

Core deposits exclude brokered &#160;

deposits. Core deposits have &#160;

historically provided 

the Corporation &#160;

with a &#160;

sizable source &#160;

of relatively &#160;

stable and &#160;

low-cost funds. &#160;

Core deposits &#160;

totaled $57.0 &#160;

billion, or &#160;

94% of &#160;

total 

deposits, at March &#160;

31, 2023, compared &#160;

with $57.6 billion, &#160;

or 94% of &#160;

total deposits, at &#160;

December 31, 2022. &#160;

Core deposits financed 

89% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at March 31, &#160;

2023, compared with 90% at December 31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

had &#160;

$1.2 &#160;

billion &#160;

in &#160;

brokered &#160;

deposits &#160;

at &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

which &#160;

financed &#160;

approximately &#160;

2% &#160;

of &#160;

its &#160;

total &#160;

assets 

(December 31, 2022 - &#160;

$1.1 billion and 2%, &#160;

respectively). &#160;

In the event that &#160;

any of the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory 

capital &#160;

ratios fall &#160;

below those &#160;

required &#160;

by &#160;

a well-capitalized &#160;

institution or &#160;

are subject &#160;

to capital &#160;

restrictions by &#160;

the regulators, &#160;

that 

banking subsidiary faces &#160;

the risk of &#160;

not being able &#160;

to raise or &#160;

maintain brokered deposits &#160;

and faces limitations &#160;

on the rate &#160;

paid on 

deposits, which &#160;

may hinder &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to &#160;

effectively compete &#160;

in its &#160;

retail markets &#160;

and could &#160;

affect its &#160;

deposit raising 

efforts. &#160;

Deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the Corporation. As of March 31, 2023, total public sector 

deposits were $15.5 billion, &#160;

compared to $15.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Generally, these deposits require that the bank pledge 

high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the 

bank receives its &#160;

collateral in return. &#160;

This, now unpledged, &#160;

collateral can either &#160;

be financed via &#160;

repurchase agreements or &#160;

sold for 

cash. &#160;

However, &#160;

there &#160;

are &#160;

some &#160;

timing &#160;

differences &#160;

between the &#160;

time &#160;

the &#160;

deposit &#160;

outflow occurs &#160;

and &#160;

when the &#160;

bank receives &#160;

its 

collateral. Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation mainly &#160;

utilizes fixed-rate U.S. &#160;

Treasury debt &#160;

securities as collateral. &#160;

While these securities 

have limited credit risk, they are subject to market &#160;

value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment. &#160;

When interest rates 

increase, the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the Corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the 

same &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

deposit &#160;

liabilities. &#160;

This &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

could &#160;

reduce &#160;

unpledged &#160;

securities &#160;

otherwise &#160;

available &#160;

as &#160;

liquidity 

sources to the Corporation. &#160;

At March 31, 2023, management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected &#160;

liquidity sources to meet 

their &#160;

anticipated &#160;

cash &#160;

flow &#160;

obligations, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

special &#160;

needs &#160;

and &#160;

off-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

commitments, &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

ordinary &#160;

course &#160;

of 

business and have sufficient &#160;

liquidity resources to address a &#160;

stress event. Although the &#160;

banking subsidiaries have historically been 

able to replace &#160;

maturing deposits and advances, &#160;

no assurance can &#160;

be given that &#160;

they would be &#160;

able to replace &#160;

those funds in &#160;

the 

future if the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s financial condition &#160;

or general market &#160;

conditions were to &#160;

deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

financial flexibility 

will &#160;

be &#160;

severely constrained &#160;

if &#160;

the &#160;

banking subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

unable to &#160;

maintain access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

or &#160;

if &#160;

adequate &#160;

financing is &#160;

not 

available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The &#160;

banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit 

cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase &#160;

agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities. To 

the extent that &#160;

the value of securities &#160;

previously pledged as collateral &#160;

declines because of market &#160;

changes, the Corporation will &#160;

be 

required to &#160;

deposit additional cash &#160;

or securities to &#160;

meet its &#160;

margin requirements, thereby &#160;

adversely affecting its &#160;

liquidity. Finally, &#160;

if 

management &#160;

is &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

rely &#160;

more &#160;

heavily &#160;

on &#160;

more &#160;

expensive &#160;

funding &#160;

sources &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

its &#160;

future &#160;

growth, &#160;

revenues &#160;

may &#160;

not 

increase proportionately to cover costs. In this &#160;

case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

The Corporation &#160;

monitors uninsured &#160;

deposits under &#160;

applicable FDIC &#160;

regulations. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

monitors accounts 

with balances over $250,000. &#160;

While the Corporation has a &#160;

diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, &#160;

corporate and government 

clients, &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

6.125% unsecured &#160;

senior debt &#160;

securities mature &#160;

in September &#160;

of 2023. &#160;

As of &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, the &#160;

BHCs had 

cash &#160;

and &#160;

money markets &#160;

investments totaling &#160;

$593 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

borrowing potential &#160;

of &#160;

$211 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

its &#160;

secured &#160;

facility &#160;

with 

BPPR. The BHCs&#8217; liquidity position continues to be adequate &#160;

with sufficient cash on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity 

which are expected to be enough to meet all interest &#160;

payments and dividend obligations during the &#160;

foreseeable future. On March 13, 

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

issued &#160;

$400 &#160;

million &#160;

aggregate &#160;

principal &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

7.25% &#160;

Senior &#160;

Notes &#160;

due &#160;

2028 &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;Notes&#8221;) &#160;

in &#160;

an 

underwritten public offering. The Corporation intends to use a portion of the proceeds &#160;

of the offering to redeem or repay $300 million 

aggregate principal &#160;

amount of &#160;

its &#160;

outstanding 6.125% &#160;

Senior &#160;

Notes due &#160;

September 2023. &#160;

For the &#160;

remainder of &#160;

year &#160;

2023, debt 

service at &#160;

the BHCs &#160;

is approximately &#160;

$40 million, &#160;

including $8 &#160;

million from &#160;

the 6.125% &#160;

unsecured senior &#160;

debt through &#160;

maturity in 

September &#160;

2023. &#160;

Additionally, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

latest &#160;

quarterly &#160;

dividend &#160;

was &#160;

$0.55 &#160;

per &#160;

share &#160;

or &#160;

approximately &#160;

$40 &#160;

million &#160;

per 

quarter. 

The BHCs have in &#160;

the past borrowed in the &#160;

corporate debt market primarily to finance &#160;

their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 

debt obligations. These &#160;

sources of funding &#160;

are more costly &#160;

due to the &#160;

fact that &#160;

two out of &#160;

the three principal &#160;

credit rating agencies 

rate the Corporation below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which &#160;

affects the Corporation&#8217;s cost and &#160;

ability to raise funds in &#160;

the capital markets. 

Factors that the Corporation &#160;

does not control, such &#160;

as the economic outlook, &#160;

interest rate volatility, &#160;

inflation, disruptions in the &#160;

debt 

market, among others, &#160;

could also affect &#160;

its ability to &#160;

obtain funding. The &#160;

Corporation has an &#160;

automatic shelf registration &#160;

statement 

filed and effective &#160;

with the Securities and Exchange &#160;

Commission, which permits the Corporation &#160;

to issue an &#160;

unspecified amount of 

debt or equity securities. 

Non-Banking Subsidiaries 

The &#160;

principal &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funding &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

include &#160;

internally &#160;

generated &#160;

cash &#160;

flows &#160;

from &#160;

operations, &#160;

loan 

sales, repurchase agreements, capital &#160;

injections and borrowed funds &#160;

from their direct &#160;

parent companies or the &#160;

holding companies. 

The principal uses of funds for the non-banking &#160;

subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, &#160;

operational expenses and payment 

of dividends to the &#160;

BHCs. The liquidity needs &#160;

of the non-banking subsidiaries &#160;

are minimal since most &#160;

of them are &#160;

funded internally 

from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings &#160;

or capital contributions from their holding companies. &#160;

Dividends 

During the &#160;

quarter ended March &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

declared cash &#160;

dividends of &#160;

$0.55 per common &#160;

share outstanding ($40 

million in the &#160;

aggregate). The dividends for the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s Series A preferred &#160;

stock amounted to $0.4 &#160;

million. During the quarter 

ended &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

BHCs &#160;

received &#160;

dividends &#160;

amounting &#160;

to &#160;

$50 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

BPPR. &#160;

Dividends &#160;

from &#160;

BPPR &#160;

constitute 

Popular, Inc.&#8217;s primary source of liquidity. &#160;

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

In addition &#160;

to cash &#160;

reserves held &#160;

at the &#160;

FRB that &#160;

totaled $ &#160;

6.1 billion &#160;

at March &#160;

31,2023, &#160;

the debt &#160;

securities portfolio &#160;

provides an 

additional &#160;

source &#160;

of &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

which &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

realized &#160;

through &#160;

either &#160;

securities &#160;

sales, &#160;

collateralized &#160;

borrowings &#160;

or &#160;

repurchase 

agreements. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

debt &#160;

securities &#160;

portfolio &#160;

consists &#160;

primarily &#160;

of &#160;

liquid &#160;

U.S. &#160;

U.S. 

government &#160;

sponsored &#160;

agency &#160;

collateralized &#160;

mortgage &#160;

obligations &#160;

that &#160;

can &#160;

be &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

raise &#160;

funds &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

repo &#160;

markets. &#160;

The 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

availability &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

repurchase &#160;

agreement &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

having &#160;

sufficient &#160;

unpledged &#160;

collateral &#160;

available &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

the 

transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s 

unpledged debt securities amounted to $ 8.0 billion at March 31, 2023 &#160;

and $ 7.8 billion at December 31, 2022. A substantial portion 

of these &#160;

debt securities &#160;

could be &#160;

used to &#160;

raise financing &#160;

in the &#160;

U.S. money &#160;

markets or &#160;

from secured &#160;

lending sources, &#160;

subject to 

changes in their fair market value and customary adjustments &#160;

(haircuts). &#160;

Additional liquidity may &#160;

be provided through &#160;

loan maturities, prepayments &#160;

and sales. The &#160;

loan portfolio can &#160;

also be used &#160;

to obtain 

funding in the capital markets. In particular, &#160;

mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have &#160;

secondary markets which the 

Corporation could use. 

Off-Balance Sheet arrangements and other commitments 

In the ordinary course &#160;

of business, the Corporation &#160;

engages in financial transactions that &#160;

are not recorded on &#160;

the balance sheet or 

may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 

provider of &#160;

financial services, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

routinely enters &#160;

into commitments &#160;

with off-balance &#160;

sheet risk &#160;

to meet &#160;

the financial 

needs of &#160;

its customers. These &#160;

commitments may include &#160;

loan commitments and &#160;

standby letters of &#160;

credit. These commitments &#160;

are 

subject &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

same &#160;

credit &#160;

policies &#160;

and &#160;

approval &#160;

process &#160;

used &#160;

for &#160;

on-balance &#160;

sheet &#160;

instruments. &#160;

These &#160;

instruments &#160;

involve, &#160;

to 

varying degrees, elements &#160;

of credit and &#160;

interest rate risk &#160;

in excess of &#160;

the amount recognized &#160;

in the statement &#160;

of financial position.

that the &#160;

Corporation enters &#160;

of business &#160;

include derivatives,

FDIC Special Assessments &#160;

On March &#160;

12 and &#160;

13, 2023, &#160;

following the &#160;

closures of &#160;

Silicon Valley &#160;

Bank (&#8220;SVB&#8221;) &#160;

and Signature Bank &#160;

and the &#160;

appointment of the 

FDIC as the &#160;

receiver for those &#160;

banks, the FDIC announced &#160;

that, under the &#160;

systemic risk exception set &#160;

forth in the &#160;

Federal Deposit 

Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), &#160;

all insured and &#160;

uninsured deposits of those &#160;

banks were transferred to &#160;

the respective bridge &#160;

banks for SVB 

and Signature Bank. &#160;

The FDIC &#160;

also announced &#160;

that, as &#160;

required by &#160;

the FDIA, &#160;

any losses &#160;

to the &#160;

Deposit Insurance &#160;

Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) &#160;

to support &#160;

uninsured 

depositors &#160;

would &#160;

be &#160;

recovered &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

special &#160;

assessment. &#160;

Under &#160;

the &#160;

FDIA, &#160;

the &#160;

assessment &#160;

may &#160;

be &#160;

on &#160;

insured &#160;

depository 

institutions, &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

holding &#160;

companies &#160;

(with &#160;

the &#160;

concurrence &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

Treasury &#160;

Secretary), &#160;

or &#160;

both, &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC 

determines to &#160;

be &#160;

appropriate. &#160;

In &#160;

March 2023 &#160;

testimony &#160;

before &#160;

Congress, the &#160;

Chairman of &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC &#160;

stated &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

FDIC &#160;

then 

preliminarily estimated the &#160;

losses to the &#160;

DIF of &#160;

resolving SVB and &#160;

Signature Bank to &#160;

be $22.5 &#160;

billion in the &#160;

aggregate. &#160;

The FDIA 

provides that the special assessment will be prescribed through regulation, and the Chairman also noted in the same &#160;

testimony that 

the FDIC &#160;

intends to &#160;

issue a &#160;

proposed rulemaking &#160;

for the &#160;

assessment in &#160;

May 2023. &#160;

The FDIC &#160;

has discretion &#160;

with respect &#160;

to the 

design and &#160;

timeframe for &#160;

any special &#160;

assessment, and, &#160;

under the &#160;

FDIA, the &#160;

FDIC may &#160;

consider the &#160;

types of &#160;

entities that &#160;

benefit 

from the action taken, economic conditions, the effects on the industry, and such other factors as the FDIC deems appropriate. &#160;

The 

timing, amount and &#160;

allocation of the special &#160;

assessment that will be &#160;

imposed on banking organizations &#160;

is uncertain, but &#160;

the impact 

of the special assessment on our noninterest &#160;

expense and results of operations may be &#160;

material.

PIHC&#8217;s &#160;

obligation &#160;

to &#160;

make &#160;

a 

guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct &#160;

payment of the required amounts to the &#160;

holders of the applicable capital securities or 

by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions 

by &#160;

liabilities in the same manner &#160;

as the applicable debentures as &#160;

set 

forth in the applicable indentures&#894; and equally with all other guarantees &#160;

that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee 

of &#160;

and &#160;

not &#160;

of &#160;

collection, &#160;

which means &#160;

that &#160;

Risks to Liquidity &#160;

Total lines of credit outstanding, or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily &#160;

a measure of the total credit 

available &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

continuing &#160;

basis. &#160;

Some &#160;

of &#160;

these &#160;

lines &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements, &#160;

changes &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

the 

collateral, standards of &#160;

creditworthiness, leverage ratios &#160;

and other regulatory &#160;

requirements, among other factors. &#160;

Derivatives, such 

as &#160;

those &#160;

embedded &#160;

in &#160;

long-term &#160;

repurchase &#160;

transactions &#160;

or &#160;

interest &#160;

exposures, &#160;

such &#160;

as 

&#160;

recourse, performance bonds &#160;

or credit card &#160;

arrangements, are subject &#160;

to collateral requirements. &#160;

As their fair &#160;

value increases, the 

collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing &#160;

the balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

market for the &#160;

Corporation is an &#160;

additional risk factor &#160;

that could affect &#160;

its financing activities. &#160;

In 

the case &#160;

of a &#160;

deterioration in economic &#160;

and fiscal conditions &#160;

in Puerto Rico, &#160;

the credit quality &#160;

of the &#160;

Corporation could be &#160;

affected 

and result &#160;

in higher &#160;

credit costs. &#160;

Refer to &#160;

the Geographic &#160;

and Government &#160;

Risk section &#160;

of this &#160;

MD&#38;A for &#160;

some highlights &#160;

on the 

current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing &#160;

fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic &#160;

outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory 

changes, &#160;

could also &#160;

affect &#160;

its &#160;

ability to &#160;

obtain funding. &#160;

In &#160;

order to &#160;

prepare for &#160;

the &#160;

possibility of &#160;

such scenario, &#160;

management &#160;

has 

adopted &#160;

contingency &#160;

plans &#160;

for &#160;

raising &#160;

financing &#160;

under &#160;

stress &#160;

scenarios &#160;

when &#160;

important &#160;

sources &#160;

of &#160;

funds &#160;

that &#160;

are &#160;

usually &#160;

fully 

available &#160;

are &#160;

temporarily &#160;

unavailable. These &#160;

plans call &#160;

for &#160;

using &#160;

alternate &#160;

funding &#160;

mechanisms, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

pledging &#160;

of &#160;

certain 

asset classes &#160;

and accessing &#160;

secured credit &#160;

lines and &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

put in &#160;

place with &#160;

the FHLB &#160;

and the &#160;

FRB. The &#160;

Corporation is 

subject to &#160;

positive tangible &#160;

capital &#160;

requirements to &#160;

utilize secured &#160;

loan facilities &#160;

with the &#160;

FHLB that &#160;

could &#160;

result in &#160;

a limitation &#160;

of 

borrowing amounts or maturity terms, even if the Corporation &#160;

exceeds well-capitalized regulatory capital levels. &#160;

The credit &#160;

ratings of &#160;

Popular&#8217;s debt &#160;

obligations are &#160;

a relevant &#160;

factor for &#160;

liquidity because &#160;

they impact &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ability to 

borrow &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

capital &#160;

markets, &#160;

its &#160;

cost &#160;

and &#160;

access &#160;

to &#160;

funding &#160;

sources. &#160;

Credit &#160;

ratings &#160;

are &#160;

based &#160;

on &#160;

the &#160;

financial &#160;

strength, &#160;

credit 

quality and &#160;

concentrations in &#160;

the loan &#160;

portfolio, the &#160;

level and &#160;

volatility of &#160;

earnings, capital &#160;

adequacy, &#160;

the quality &#160;

of management, 

geographic concentration &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico, the &#160;

liquidity of &#160;

the balance &#160;

sheet, the &#160;

availability of &#160;

a significant &#160;

base of &#160;

core retail &#160;

and 

commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access &#160;

a broad array of wholesale funding sources, &#160;

among other factors. &#160;

Furthermore, &#160;

various &#160;

statutory &#160;

provisions &#160;

limit &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

of &#160;

dividends &#160;

an &#160;

insured &#160;

depository &#160;

institution &#160;

may &#160;

pay &#160;

to &#160;

its &#160;

holding 

company without &#160;

regulatory approval. A &#160;

member bank must &#160;

obtain the &#160;

approval of &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board &#160;

for any &#160;

dividend, if 

the total &#160;

of all &#160;

dividends declared &#160;

by the &#160;

member bank &#160;

during the &#160;

calendar year &#160;

would exceed &#160;

the total &#160;

of its &#160;

net income &#160;

for that 

year, &#160;

combined with &#160;

its retained &#160;

net income &#160;

for the &#160;

preceding two &#160;

years, after &#160;

considering those &#160;

years&#8217; dividend &#160;

activity, &#160;

less any 

required transfers to surplus or to a &#160;

fund for the retirement of any &#160;

preferred stock. During the quarter ended March 31, &#160;

2023, BPPR 

declared cash dividends of $50 million. At March 31, 2023, BPPR can declare a dividend of approximately $259 million without prior 

approval of the Federal Reserve Board due to its retained income, declared &#160;

dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over 

the measurement &#160;

period. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

a member &#160;

bank may &#160;

not declare &#160;

or pay &#160;

a dividend &#160;

in an &#160;

amount greater &#160;

than its &#160;

undivided 

profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, &#160;

unless the member bank has received the &#160;

approval of the Federal Reserve 

Board. A &#160;

member bank &#160;

also may &#160;

not permit &#160;

any portion &#160;

of its &#160;

permanent capital to &#160;

be withdrawn &#160;

unless the &#160;

withdrawal has &#160;

been 

approved by &#160;

the Federal &#160;

Reserve Board. Pursuant &#160;

to these &#160;

requirements, PB may &#160;

not declare &#160;

or pay &#160;

a dividend &#160;

without the &#160;

prior 

approval of the &#160;

Federal Reserve Board and &#160;

the NYSDFS. The &#160;

ability of a &#160;

bank subsidiary to &#160;

up-stream dividends to its &#160;

BHC could 

thus &#160;

be &#160;

impacted &#160;

by &#160;

its &#160;

financial &#160;

performance &#160;

and &#160;

capital, &#160;

including &#160;

tangible &#160;

and &#160;

regulatory &#160;

capital, &#160;

thus &#160;

potentially &#160;

limiting &#160;

the 

amount &#160;

of &#160;

cash &#160;

moving &#160;

up &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

BHCs &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries. &#160;

This &#160;

could, &#160;

in &#160;

turn, &#160;

affect &#160;

the &#160;

BHCs &#160;

ability &#160;

to &#160;

declare 

dividends on its outstanding common and preferred &#160;

stock, repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations, &#160;

for example. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not &#160;

used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance &#160;

its operations, and 

therefore are less sensitive to the level and &#160;

changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

currently &#160;

do &#160;

not &#160;

issue &#160;

unsecured &#160;

senior &#160;

debt, &#160;

as &#160;

these &#160;

banking &#160;

subsidiaries &#160;

are &#160;

funded 

primarily with &#160;

deposits and &#160;

secured borrowings. &#160;

The banking &#160;

subsidiaries had &#160;

$8.7 million &#160;

in deposits &#160;

at March &#160;

31, 2023 &#160;

that are 

subject to rating triggers. &#160;

In addition, &#160;

certain mortgage servicing &#160;

and custodial agreements &#160;

that BPPR &#160;

has with &#160;

third parties &#160;

include rating covenants. &#160;

In the 

event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 

escrow &#160;

deposits &#160;

and/or &#160;

increase &#160;

collateral &#160;

levels &#160;

securing &#160;

the &#160;

recourse &#160;

obligations. &#160;

to &#160;

secure &#160;

such &#160;

are &#160;

not &#160;

maintained. &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation &#160;

to &#160;

amounted &#160;

to 

approximately &#160;

$28.2 &#160;

million &#160;

at &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

could &#160;

be &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

post &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

under &#160;

the 

agreements. &#160;

Management &#160;

that &#160;

it &#160;

be &#160;

able &#160;

to &#160;

meet &#160;

additional &#160;

collateral &#160;

requirements &#160;

if &#160;

and &#160;

when &#160;

needed. &#160;

The 

requirements &#160;

to &#160;

collateral under &#160;

certain &#160;

agreements or &#160;

the &#160;

loss &#160;

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

A &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of &#160;

our financial &#160;

activities and &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure is &#160;

concentrated in &#160;

the &#160;

Commonwealth of &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

(&#8220;Puerto 

Rico&#8221;), which has faced severe economic and fiscal &#160;

challenges in the past and may face additional &#160;

challenges in the future. &#160;

Economic Performance. &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy suffered &#160;

a &#160;

severe and &#160;

prolonged recession &#160;

from &#160;

2007 &#160;

to &#160;

2017, &#160;

with real &#160;

gross national &#160;

product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) 

contracting approximately 15% &#160;

during this &#160;

period. In 2017, &#160;

Hurricane Mar&#237;a caused &#160;

significant damage and &#160;

destruction across the 

island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico&#8217;s &#160;

economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in &#160;

part aided by 

the large amount &#160;

of federal disaster &#160;

relief and recovery &#160;

assistance funds injected &#160;

into the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy in &#160;

connection with 

Hurricane Mar&#237;a &#160;

and other &#160;

recent natural &#160;

disasters. This &#160;

growth was &#160;

interrupted by &#160;

the economic &#160;

shock caused &#160;

by the &#160;

COVID-19 

pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part &#160;

aided by additional federal assistance from &#160;

pandemic-related stimulus measures. 

The &#160;

latest &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

Economic Activity &#160;

Index, &#160;

published &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Economic &#160;

Development Bank &#160;

for &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;Economic 

Activity Index&#8221;), reflected a 0.6% and &#160;

0.2% decrease in January and February &#160;

2023, respectively, compared to &#160;

the same months in 

2022. During January and February &#160;

2023, the Economic Activity Index &#160;

increased by 0.5% and 0.3%, &#160;

respectively, in &#160;

a month-over-

month basis. &#160;

The Economic Activity Index is a coincident indicator of ongoing &#160;

economic activity but not a direct measurement of real 

GNP. &#160;

In February &#160;

2023, the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Planning Board &#160;

revised its &#160;

real GNP &#160;

forecast for &#160;

the current &#160;

fiscal year &#160;

(July 2022-June 

2023) from 1.7% growth to 0.7% growth, citing &#160;

an anticipated deacceleration in the global economy. &#160;

While the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy has &#160;

not directly &#160;

tracked the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy in &#160;

recent years, &#160;

many of &#160;

the external &#160;

factors 

that impact &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy &#160;

are affected &#160;

by the &#160;

policies and performance &#160;

of the &#160;

United States &#160;

economy. &#160;

These external 

factors include &#160;

the level &#160;

of interest &#160;

rates and &#160;

the rate &#160;

of inflation. &#160;

Inflation in &#160;

the United &#160;

States, as &#160;

measured by the &#160;

United States 

Consumer Price Index (published by the U.S. &#160;

Bureau of Labor Statistics), increased 5.0% during &#160;

the 12-month period ended March 

2023, mainly driven by pent-up demand and supply-chain &#160;

disruptions caused by the pandemic. &#160;

During the same period, inflation in 

Puerto Rico, as measured by the Puerto Rico Consumer Price Index (published by the Department of Labor and Human Resources 

of Puerto &#160;

Rico), increased 5.1% &#160;

for similar &#160;

reasons. The rate &#160;

of inflation has &#160;

slowed down &#160;

in recent months, &#160;

following a &#160;

mid-2022 

peak, as the Federal Reserve has implemented a series &#160;

of benchmark interest rate increases. The speed and &#160;

scope of the inflation 

slowdown will &#160;

inform if &#160;

and how &#160;

much &#160;

interest rates &#160;

will continue &#160;

to &#160;

increase, as &#160;

well how &#160;

these changes &#160;

will &#160;

impact the &#160;

United 

States and Puerto Rico economies. &#160;

Fiscal Challenges. &#160;

As the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

economy contracted, the &#160;

government&#8217;s public &#160;

debt rose &#160;

rapidly, &#160;

in part &#160;

from borrowing to &#160;

cover deficits &#160;

to pay 

debt service, &#160;

pension benefits and &#160;

other government &#160;

expenditures. By 2016, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico government had &#160;

over $120 &#160;

billion in 

combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had &#160;

lost access to the capital markets, and was in &#160;

the midst of a fiscal crisis. 

Puerto &#160;

Rico&#8217;s &#160;

escalating fiscal &#160;

and economic &#160;

challenges &#160;

and imminent &#160;

widespread defaults &#160;

in &#160;

its &#160;

public debt &#160;

prompted the &#160;

U.S. 

Congress to &#160;

enact the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Oversight, Management, &#160;

and Economic &#160;

Stability Act &#160;

(&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in &#160;

June 2016. &#160;

PROMESA 

created the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; with ample powers over Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 

instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, &#160;

&#8220;PR Government Entities&#8221;). Pursuant &#160;

to PROMESA, the &#160;

Oversight Board will be &#160;

in 

place &#160;

until &#160;

market &#160;

access &#160;

is &#160;

restored &#160;

and &#160;

balanced &#160;

budgets &#160;

are &#160;

produced &#160;

for &#160;

at &#160;

least &#160;

four &#160;

consecutive &#160;

years. &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

also 

established two &#160;

mechanisms for &#160;

the restructuring &#160;

of the &#160;

obligations of &#160;

PR Government &#160;

Entities: (a) &#160;

Title III, &#160;

which provides &#160;

an in-

court process that incorporates many of the &#160;

powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code &#160;

and permits adjustment of a broad 

&#160;

&#160;

range of obligations, and &#160;

(b) Title VI, &#160;

which provides for a &#160;

largely out-of-court process through which &#160;

modifications to financial debt 

can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors &#160;

and bind holdouts. 

Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several &#160;

of its instrumentalities have availed themselves &#160;

of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 

III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 

including Government &#160;

Development Bank for &#160;

Puerto Rico, &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico Sales &#160;

Tax &#160;

Financing Corporation, and &#160;

the Puerto &#160;

Rico 

Highways &#160;

and &#160;

Transportation &#160;

Authority, &#160;

have &#160;

also &#160;

completed &#160;

debt &#160;

restructurings &#160;

under &#160;

Titles &#160;

III &#160;

or &#160;

VI &#160;

of &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

While &#160;

the 

majority &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debt &#160;

has &#160;

already &#160;

been &#160;

restructured, &#160;

some &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities &#160;

still &#160;

face &#160;

significant &#160;

fiscal &#160;

challenges. &#160;

For 

example, the &#160;

Puerto Rico &#160;

Electric Power &#160;

Authority is &#160;

still in &#160;

the process &#160;

of restructuring &#160;

its debts &#160;

under Title &#160;

III of &#160;

PROMESA and 

other PR Government &#160;

Entities, such as &#160;

the Puerto Rico &#160;

Industrial Development Company, &#160;

have defaulted on &#160;

their bonds but &#160;

have 

not commenced debt restructuring proceedings under &#160;

PROMESA. &#160;

Municipalities. &#160;

Puerto Rico&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges have &#160;

also adversely impacted its municipalities. Budgetary subsidies to municipalities 

have &#160;

gradually &#160;

declined &#160;

in &#160;

recent &#160;

years &#160;

and &#160;

are &#160;

scheduled &#160;

to &#160;

be &#160;

ultimately &#160;

eliminated &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

year &#160;

2025 &#160;

as &#160;

part &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

fiscal 

measures &#160;

required &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board. &#160;

According &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

latest &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

fiscal &#160;

plan &#160;

certified &#160;

by &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board, 

municipalities &#160;

have &#160;

made &#160;

little &#160;

to &#160;

no &#160;

progress &#160;

towards &#160;

implementing &#160;

the &#160;

fiscal &#160;

discipline &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

reduce &#160;

reliance &#160;

on &#160;

these 

budgetary appropriations and this &#160;

lack of fiscal &#160;

management may threaten the &#160;

ability of certain &#160;

municipalities to provide &#160;

necessary 

services, such as health, sanitation, public safety &#160;

and emergency services to their residents, forcing them &#160;

to prioritize expenditures. 

Municipalities &#160;

are &#160;

subject &#160;

to &#160;

PROMESA &#160;

and, &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board&#8217;s &#160;

request, &#160;

are &#160;

required &#160;

to &#160;

submit &#160;

fiscal &#160;

plans &#160;

and &#160;

annual 

budgets &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

for &#160;

its &#160;

review &#160;

and &#160;

approval. &#160;

They &#160;

are &#160;

also &#160;

required to &#160;

seek &#160;

Oversight &#160;

Board &#160;

approval &#160;

to &#160;

issue, 

guarantee &#160;

or &#160;

modify &#160;

their &#160;

debts &#160;

and &#160;

to &#160;

enter &#160;

into &#160;

contracts &#160;

with an &#160;

aggregate &#160;

value &#160;

of &#160;

$10 &#160;

million &#160;

or &#160;

more. &#160;

With &#160;

the &#160;

Oversight 

Board&#8217;s approval, municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. To 

date, however, no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring &#160;

process. &#160;

Exposure of the Corporation &#160;

The credit &#160;

quality of BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

loan portfolio &#160;

reflects, among other &#160;

things, the &#160;

general economic conditions &#160;

in Puerto &#160;

Rico and &#160;

other 

adverse conditions affecting Puerto &#160;

Rico consumers and businesses. &#160;

Deterioration in the Puerto &#160;

Rico economy has resulted &#160;

in the 

past, and could &#160;

result in the future, &#160;

in higher delinquencies, greater &#160;

charge-offs and increased losses, &#160;

which could materially affect 

our financial condition and results of operations. &#160;

At March &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

direct exposure &#160;

to PR &#160;

Government Entities &#160;

totaled $353 &#160;

million, of &#160;

which $324 &#160;

million were 

outstanding, compared &#160;

to &#160;

$374 million &#160;

at &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022, of &#160;

which $327 &#160;

million &#160;

were outstanding. &#160;

A &#160;

deterioration in &#160;

Puerto 

Rico&#8217;s fiscal and &#160;

economic situation could adversely &#160;

affect the value &#160;

of our Puerto &#160;

Rico government obligations, resulting &#160;

in losses 

to &#160;

us. &#160;

Of &#160;

the &#160;

amount &#160;

outstanding, &#160;

$302 &#160;

million &#160;

consists &#160;

of &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

$22 &#160;

million &#160;

are &#160;

securities &#160;

($302 &#160;

million &#160;

and &#160;

$25 &#160;

million, 

respectively, at &#160;

December 31, 2022). &#160;

All of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure &#160;

outstanding at March &#160;

31, 2023 were &#160;

obligations from 

various &#160;

Puerto &#160;

Rico &#160;

municipalities. &#160;

In &#160;

most &#160;

cases, &#160;

these &#160;

were &#160;

&#8220;general &#160;

obligations&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

municipality, &#160;

to &#160;

which &#160;

the &#160;

applicable 

municipality &#160;

has &#160;

pledged its &#160;

good &#160;

faith, credit &#160;

and unlimited &#160;

taxing power, &#160;

or &#160;

&#8220;special obligations&#8221; &#160;

of &#160;

a municipality, &#160;

to &#160;

which the 

applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax revenues. &#160;

At March 31, 2023, 73% of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure 

to &#160;

municipal &#160;

loans &#160;

and &#160;

securities &#160;

was &#160;

concentrated &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

municipalities &#160;

of &#160;

San &#160;

Juan, &#160;

Guaynabo, &#160;

Carolina &#160;

and &#160;

Bayam&#243;n. &#160;

For 

additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto &#160;

Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, 

refer to Note 21 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies &#160;

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &#160;

In addition, at March &#160;

31, 2023, the Corporation had &#160;

$245 million in loans &#160;

insured or securities issued by &#160;

Puerto Rico governmental 

entities, but for &#160;

which the principal source &#160;

of repayment is &#160;

non-governmental ($251 million at December 31, 2022). &#160;

These included 

$204 million in &#160;

residential mortgage loans insured &#160;

by the Puerto &#160;

Rico Housing Finance Authority &#160;

(&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a &#160;

PR Government Entity 

(December 31, 2022 - $209 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto &#160;

Rico residential properties and 

the &#160;

HFA &#160;

insurance &#160;

covers &#160;

losses &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

event &#160;

of &#160;

a &#160;

borrower &#160;

default &#160;

and &#160;

upon &#160;

the &#160;

satisfaction &#160;

of &#160;

certain &#160;

other &#160;

conditions. &#160;

The 

Corporation also &#160;

had &#160;

at &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

$41 &#160;

million &#160;

in bonds &#160;

issued by &#160;

HFA &#160;

which &#160;

are secured &#160;

by &#160;

second &#160;

mortgage &#160;

loans on 

Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to &#160;

cover losses in the event of a borrower default, and 

upon the satisfaction of certain &#160;

other conditions (December 31, 2022 - $42 &#160;

million). In the event that &#160;

the mortgage loans insured by 

HFA and held &#160;

by the Corporation directly or those serving &#160;

as collateral for the HFA &#160;

bonds default and the collateral is &#160;

insufficient to 

satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA&#8217;s &#160;

ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

condition &#160;

of &#160;

HFA &#160;

at &#160;

the &#160;

time &#160;

such &#160;

obligations &#160;

become &#160;

due &#160;

and &#160;

payable. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

does &#160;

not &#160;

consider &#160;

the &#160;

government 

guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated &#160;

with this portfolio. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

commercial loan &#160;

portfolio also &#160;

includes loans &#160;

to &#160;

private borrowers &#160;

who &#160;

are service &#160;

providers, lessors, &#160;

suppliers or &#160;

have 

other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively &#160;

affected by a deterioration in the fiscal &#160;

and economic 

situation &#160;

of &#160;

PR &#160;

Government &#160;

Entities. &#160;

Similarly, &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

mortgage &#160;

and &#160;

consumer &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolios &#160;

include &#160;

loans &#160;

to &#160;

government 

employees &#160;

and &#160;

retirees, &#160;

which &#160;

could &#160;

also &#160;

be &#160;

negatively &#160;

affected &#160;

by &#160;

fiscal &#160;

measures, &#160;

such &#160;

as &#160;

employee &#160;

layoffs &#160;

or &#160;

furloughs &#160;

or 

reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic &#160;

situation deteriorates. 

As of March 31, 2023, BPPR had $15.5 billion in deposits from the Puerto Rico government, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. 

The &#160;

rate &#160;

at &#160;

which &#160;

public &#160;

deposit &#160;

balances &#160;

may &#160;

decline is &#160;

uncertain and &#160;

difficult &#160;

to &#160;

predict. &#160;

The &#160;

amount &#160;

and &#160;

timing &#160;

of &#160;

any &#160;

such 

reduction is &#160;

likely to &#160;

be impacted &#160;

by, &#160;

for example, &#160;

the speed &#160;

at which &#160;

federal assistance &#160;

is distributed &#160;

and the &#160;

financial condition, 

liquidity and cash management practices of such entities, &#160;

as well as on the ability of BPPR to &#160;

maintain these customer relationships. 

The &#160;

Corporation may &#160;

also have &#160;

direct &#160;

exposure with &#160;

regards to &#160;

avoidance and &#160;

other causes &#160;

of &#160;

action initiated &#160;

by the &#160;

Oversight 

Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 21 

to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

United States Virgin Islands 

The &#160;

Corporation &#160;

has &#160;

operations &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

United &#160;

States &#160;

Virgin &#160;

Islands &#160;

(the &#160;

&#8220;USVI&#8221;) &#160;

and &#160;

has &#160;

credit &#160;

exposure &#160;

to &#160;

USVI &#160;

government 

entities. 

The USVI has &#160;

been experiencing a &#160;

number of fiscal &#160;

and economic challenges, &#160;

which could adversely &#160;

affect the &#160;

ability of its &#160;

public 

corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding &#160;

debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI &#160;

and, as such, 

there &#160;

is &#160;

currently &#160;

no &#160;

federal &#160;

legislation &#160;

permitting &#160;

the &#160;

restructuring &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

debts &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

USVI &#160;

and &#160;

its &#160;

public &#160;

corporations &#160;

and 

instrumentalities. 

To &#160;

the extent that &#160;

the fiscal condition &#160;

of the USVI &#160;

continues to deteriorate, the &#160;

U.S. Congress or the &#160;

Government of the &#160;

USVI may 

enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the &#160;

financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing &#160;

a stay on creditor 

remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable &#160;

to the USVI. 

At March &#160;

31, 2023, &#160;

the Corporation &#160;

had approximately &#160;

$28 million &#160;

in direct &#160;

exposure to &#160;

USVI government &#160;

entities (December 31, 

2022 - $28 million). &#160;

British Virgin Islands 

The Corporation has operations in the British Virgin Islands (&#8220;BVI&#8221;), which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, 

particularly as &#160;

a reduction &#160;

in the &#160;

tourism activity &#160;

which accounts &#160;

for a &#160;

significant portion &#160;

of its &#160;

economy. &#160;

Although the &#160;

Corporation 

has no &#160;

significant exposure to &#160;

a single &#160;

borrower in &#160;

the BVI, &#160;

at March 31, &#160;

2023, it &#160;

has a &#160;

loan portfolio amounting &#160;

to approximately 

$210 million comprised of various retail and commercial &#160;

clients, compared to a loan portfolio of $214 million &#160;

at December 31, 2022. 

U.S. Government 

As further detailed in Notes &#160;

6 and 7 to the &#160;

Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s investment 

securities &#160;

represented exposure &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

U.S. &#160;

Government in &#160;

the &#160;

form &#160;

of &#160;

U.S. Government &#160;

sponsored entities, &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

agency 

mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.6 billion &#160;

of residential mortgages, $27 million of SBA loans under the 

Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) and $73 million &#160;

commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by &#160;

the U.S. Government or its 

agencies at March 31, 2023 (compared to $1.6 &#160;

billion, $38 million and $72 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022).

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) &#160;

include primarily past-due &#160;

loans that &#160;

are no &#160;

longer accruing interest, &#160;

renegotiated loans, and &#160;

real 

estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit &#160;

quality metrics, is presented in Table 21. 

During &#160;

the &#160;

first &#160;

quarter &#160;

of &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

Corporation continued &#160;

to &#160;

show &#160;

favorable &#160;

credit &#160;

quality &#160;

trends with &#160;

low &#160;

levels &#160;

of &#160;

NCOs &#160;

and 

decreasing NPLs. &#160;

We continue &#160;

to closely &#160;

monitor changes &#160;

in the &#160;

macroeconomic environment &#160;

and borrower &#160;

performance, given 

inflationary &#160;

pressures and &#160;

geopolitical &#160;

risks. &#160;

However, &#160;

management believes &#160;

that &#160;

the &#160;

improvement &#160;

over &#160;

recent years &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

risk 

profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios positions &#160;

Popular to operate successfully under the current environment. &#160;

Total &#160;

NPAs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$24 &#160;

million &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

with &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

Total &#160;

non-performing &#160;

loans &#160;

held-in-portfolio 

(&#8220;NPLs&#8221;) &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$27 &#160;

million &#160;

from &#160;

December &#160;

31, &#160;

2022. &#160;

BPPR&#8217;s &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$23 &#160;

million, &#160;

mainly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

lower 

mortgage and consumer NPLs &#160;

by $18 million &#160;

and $14 million, respectively, &#160;

in part offset &#160;

by higher commercial NPLs &#160;

by $9 million. &#160;

The &#160;

consumer &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decrease &#160;

was &#160;

mostly &#160;

driven &#160;

by &#160;

a &#160;

$11 &#160;

million &#160;

line &#160;

of &#160;

credit &#160;

charge-off &#160;

on &#160;

a &#160;

single &#160;

relationship, &#160;

while &#160;

the 

commercial &#160;

NPLs &#160;

increase &#160;

was &#160;

driven &#160;

NPLs &#160;

decreased &#160;

by &#160;

$4 &#160;

million &#160;

from 

December 31, 2022, mainly driven by lower mortgage NPLs. At March 31, 2023, &#160;

the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 

1.3% compared &#160;

to 1.4%, &#160;

at December &#160;

31, 2022. &#160;

Other real &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s commercial &#160;

loan portfolio secured &#160;

by real estate &#160;

(&#8220;CRE&#8221;) amounted to &#160;

$10.0 billion at &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, of which 

$3.0 billion was secured &#160;

with owner occupied properties, compared &#160;

with $9.9 billion and &#160;

$3.1 billion, respectively, &#160;

at December 31, 

2022. Office space &#160;

our non-owner occupied &#160;

CRE portfolio is &#160;

limited, representing only &#160;

1.9% or $608 &#160;

million of 

our total loan portfolio. &#160;

The exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with average &#160;

loan size of $2.0 million and is 

well diversified across tenant type. 

CRE NPLs amounted to &#160;

$67 million at March &#160;

31, 2023, compared with &#160;

$54 million at &#160;

December 31, 2022. The CRE &#160;

were 1.30% and 0.11%, &#160;

respectively, at &#160;

March 31, 2023, compared &#160;

with 1.04% and &#160;

0.12%, 

respectively, at December 31, 2022. 

In addition &#160;

to the &#160;

NPLs included &#160;

in Table &#160;

21, at &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, there &#160;

were $334 &#160;

million of &#160;

performing loans, &#160;

mostly commercial 

loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2022 

- $374 million). 

For the period ended March 31, 2023, total inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio, excluding consumer loans, increased by approximately 

$4 &#160;

million, &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

higher commercial inflows &#160;

by $10 &#160;

the Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

policy to report &#160;

mortgage loans &#160;

insured by FHA &#160;

or guaranteed by &#160;

the VA &#160;

as accruing loans &#160;

past due 

90 days or more as opposed to non-performing &#160;

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, &#160;

2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), 

represents management&#8217;s estimate &#160;

of expected credit &#160;

losses through the &#160;

remaining contractual life &#160;

of the &#160;

different loan segments, 

impacted by expected &#160;

prepayments. The ACL &#160;

is maintained at &#160;

a sufficient &#160;

level to provide &#160;

for estimated credit &#160;

losses on collateral 

dependent &#160;

loans &#160;

as &#160;

well &#160;

as &#160;

loans &#160;

modified &#160;

to &#160;

borrowers &#160;

with &#160;

financial &#160;

difficulty, &#160;

including &#160;

legacy &#160;

troubled &#160;

debt &#160;

restructurings, 

separately &#160;

from &#160;

the &#160;

remainder &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

loan &#160;

portfolio. &#160;

The &#160;

Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

management &#160;

evaluates &#160;

the &#160;

adequacy &#160;

of &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

on &#160;

a 

quarterly &#160;

basis. &#160;

In &#160;

this &#160;

evaluation, &#160;

management &#160;

considers &#160;

current &#160;

conditions, &#160;

macroeconomic &#160;

economic &#160;

expectations &#160;

through &#160;

a 

reasonable and supportable period, &#160;

historical loss experience, portfolio composition &#160;

by loan type &#160;

and risk characteristics, results &#160;

of 

periodic credit reviews &#160;

of individual loans, &#160;

and regulatory requirements, amongst &#160;

other factors. The &#160;

Corporation evaluates, at &#160;

least 

on an &#160;

annual basis, the &#160;

assumptions tied to &#160;

the CECL &#160;

accounting framework, including &#160;

the reasonable &#160;

and supportable period &#160;

as 

well as the reversion window. &#160;

The Corporation must rely on &#160;

estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where &#160;

the ultimate outcome is unknown, &#160;

such as 

economic developments affecting specific &#160;

customers, industries, or markets. &#160;

Other factors that can &#160;

affect management&#8217;s estimates 

are &#160;

recalibration &#160;

of &#160;

statistical &#160;

models &#160;

used &#160;

to &#160;

calculate &#160;

lifetime &#160;

expected &#160;

losses, &#160;

changes &#160;

in &#160;

underwriting &#160;

standards, &#160;

financial 

accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, &#160;

among others. Changes in the financial condition &#160;

of individual borrowers, 

in economic &#160;

conditions, and &#160;

in the &#160;

condition of &#160;

the various &#160;

markets in &#160;

which collateral &#160;

may be &#160;

sold, may &#160;

also affect &#160;

the required 

level of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses. Consequently, &#160;

the business &#160;

financial condition, &#160;

liquidity, &#160;

capital, and &#160;

results of &#160;

operations 

could also be affected. 

Given that any one &#160;

economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the &#160;

Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate &#160;

its ACL. The 

baseline scenario &#160;

continues to &#160;

be assigned &#160;

the highest &#160;

probability, &#160;

followed &#160;

by the &#160;

pessimistic scenario. &#160;

The baseline &#160;

scenario 

assumes a 2023 annualized &#160;

GDP growth in the &#160;

baseline scenario stands at &#160;

2.1% and 1.3% for &#160;

Puerto Rico and the &#160;

United States, 

respectively, &#160;

increasing from &#160;

1.3% and &#160;

0.7% in &#160;

the previous &#160;

quarter. The &#160;

2023 forecasted &#160;

average unemployment &#160;

rate continues 

strong, improving quarter-over-quarter to &#160;

6.9% and 3.5% &#160;

for Puerto Rico &#160;

and the United &#160;

States, respectively, &#160;

from 7.8% and &#160;

4.0% 

respectively, in the previous forecast. &#160;

At &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2023, &#160;

the &#160;

allowance &#160;

for &#160;

credit &#160;

losses &#160;

amounted &#160;

to &#160;

$689 &#160;

million, &#160;

a &#160;

decrease &#160;

of &#160;

$31 &#160;

million, &#160;

when &#160;

compared &#160;

with 

December 31, 2022. &#160;

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2022-02 in 

March 2022, which eliminates the &#160;

accounting guidance for troubled debt &#160;

restructures (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and the requirement &#160;

to measure the 

&#160;

Corporation used &#160;

a &#160;

(&#8220;DCF&#8221;) &#160;

method. &#160;

This 

impact &#160;

resulted &#160;

in &#160;

a &#160;

release &#160;

in &#160;

the &#160;

ACL &#160;

of &#160;

approximately &#160;

$46 &#160;

as &#160;

an &#160;

adjustment &#160;

to &#160;

the &#160;

beginning &#160;

balance &#160;

of 

retained earnings, net of tax effect. &#160;

Excluding ASU 2022-02 impact, the &#160;

ACL for BPPR increased by &#160;

$14 million, when compared to &#160;

December 31, 2022, mostly driven 

by reductions in the HPI forecast, higher loan volumes and migration of consumer credit scores. The ACL for &#160;

Popular U.S remained 

essentially flat &#160;

from &#160;

December 31, &#160;

2022. quarter-over-quarter. &#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s &#160;

ratio of &#160;

the allowance &#160;

for credit &#160;

losses to &#160;

loans 

held-in-portfolio was &#160;

2.13% at &#160;

March 31, &#160;

2023, compared &#160;

to 2.25% &#160;

in December &#160;

31, 2022. &#160;

The ratio &#160;

of the &#160;

allowance for &#160;

credit 

losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 167.1%, &#160;

compared to 163.9% in December 31, 2022. 

The provision for credit losses &#160;

for the period ended March 31, &#160;

2023, amounted to an expense of &#160;

$47 million, compared to a benefit 

of &#160;

$14 &#160;

million &#160;

for &#160;

the &#160;

period &#160;

ended &#160;

March &#160;

31, &#160;

2022, &#160;

as &#160;

the &#160;

prior &#160;

period &#160;

included &#160;

reductions &#160;

in &#160;

NCOs for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 &#160;

amounted to $33 million, increasing by $29 million when compared to &#160;

the same period 

in 2022. The &#160;

BPPR segment increased by &#160;

$26 million mainly &#160;

driven by higher consumer &#160;

NCOs by $23 &#160;

million. The increase in &#160;

the 

consumer NCOs was &#160;

mostly related &#160;

to $11 &#160;

million line &#160;

of credit charge-off &#160;

on a single &#160;

borrower and post-pandemic &#160;

normalization. 

The PB segment NCOs increased by $3 million, mainly &#160;

driven by higher consumer NCOs by $4 &#160;

million.
