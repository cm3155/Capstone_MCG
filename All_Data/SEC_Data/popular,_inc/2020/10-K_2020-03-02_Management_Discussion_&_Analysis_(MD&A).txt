SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19)
surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally to
other countries and jurisdictions,
including the mainland
United States and Puerto Rico. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The
COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively
impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains,
created significant volatility and disruption in financial
markets,
levels
increased
worldwide and decreased consumer confidence and commercial
activity generally, including in the markets in which we do
business, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults
and foreclosures.

unemployment

significantly

The disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic had an
impact on the macroeconomic environment and therefore on
the financial results of
the Corporation. Although certain
measures initially imposed in response to the pandemic by the
governments of Puerto Rico, the United States and United
States Virgin Islands, including lockdowns, business closures,
mandatory curfews and limits
to public activities, were
thereafter gradually relaxed throughout 2020 to allow for the
gradual reopening of the economy, certain restrictions remain
in place, which result in many businesses not being able to
operate at their full capacity. The Corporation’s results for the
third and fourth quarters of 2020 reflect the benefit of increased
economic activity resulting from such reopening and the related
improvement in the macroeconomic environment, as well as
the impact of
the various government stimulus programs
launched in response to the pandemic.

Beginning in March 2020, the Corporation implemented
several financial relief programs in response to the pandemic,
including
of
payment moratoriums,
foreclosures and other collection activity, as well as waivers of
certain fees and service charges.

b)

During the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation reinstated
the imposition of the fees it elected to waive in connection with
such financial relief programs and resumed delinquent loan
collection efforts. During 2020, the Corporation had granted
loan payment moratoriums to 127,117 eligible retail customers
with an aggregate book value of $4.4 billion, and to 5,099
eligible commercial clients with an aggregate book value of

$3.9 billion as detailed below. These include loan payment
moratoriums of government guaranteed loans that qualified for
disaster relief programs as well as other available alternatives.
While COVID-19-related moratoriums were offered beginning
in March of 2020, certain clients benefitted from loan payment
moratoriums offered by the Corporation since mid-January
2020 as a result of seismic activity in the Southern region of the
island in January 2020. At December 31, 2020, 127,857 loans
with an aggregate book value of $7.8 billion had already
completed their payment moratorium period, while 4,359 loans
with an aggregate book value of $0.5 billion remained under
the moratorium. As of the end of the year, 97% of COVID-19
payment deferrals had expired. After excluding government
guaranteed loans, 115,079 of remaining loans, or 94%, with an
aggregate book value of $6.9 billion were current on their
payments as of December 31, 2020. Loans considered current

Impact of the adoption of the current expected credit loss
model (“CECL”)
The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard

Accounting Pronouncements”. As a result of the adoption of
the CECL model, the Corporation recorded a net increase in its

treasury stock transaction. This transaction increased by $2.20
the Corporation’s tangible book value per share.

Redemption of Series B Preferred Stock
On February 24, 2020, the Corporation redeemed all outstanding
shares of its 8.25% Non-Cumulative Monthly Income Preferred
Stock, Series B (“Series B Preferred Stock”). The Series B Preferred
Stock was redeemed at the redemption price of $25.00 per share,
plus $0.1375 in accrued and unpaid dividends on each share, for a
total payment per share in the amount of $25.1375 and a total
aggregate payment of $28.2 million.

Increase in Common Stock Dividends
On January 9, 2020, the Corporation announced an increase in
its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per
share, payable commencing in the second quarter of 2020,
subject to the approval of the Corporation’s Board of Directors.

except for approximately $17 million related to purchased
credit impaired (“PCI”) loans previously accounted under ASC
Subtopic 310-30, which resulted in a reclassification between
certain contra loan balance accounts to the allowance for credit
losses.

As part of the adoption of CECL, the Corporation made the
election to break the existing pools of PCI loans, which were
excluded from non-performing status, in accordance with the
applicable accounting guidance. Upon being measured at the
individual loan level, these loans are no longer excluded from
non-performing status, resulting in an increase of $278 million
in NPLs as of
January 1, 2020. This increase included
$144 million in loans that were over 90 days past due and
$134 million in loans that were not delinquent in their payment
terms but were reported as non-performing due to other credit
quality considerations.

The Corporation availed itself of the option to phase in over
a period of three years, beginning on January 1, 2022, the
day-one effects on regulatory capital arising from the adoption
of CECL. Refer to the Regulatory Capital section of this MD&A
for additional information on regulatory capital.

Common Stock Repurchase Plan
On May 27, 2020, the Corporation completed a $500 million
accelerated share repurchase transaction (“ASR”) with respect
to its common stock. On March 19, 2020 (the “early
the dealer counterparty to the ASR
termination date”),
exercised its right under the ASR agreement to terminate the
transaction because the trading price of
the Corporation’s
common stock fell below a specified level due to the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic on the global markets. As a result of
such early termination, the final settlement of the ASR, which
was originally expected to occur during the fourth quarter of
2020, occurred during the second quarter of 2020.

Under the ASR, the Corporation prepaid $500 million and
received from the dealer counterparty an initial delivery of
7,055,919 shares of common stock on February 3, 2020. As
part of the final settlement of the ASR, the Corporation received
an additional 4,763,216 shares of common stock after the early
the Corporation repurchased
termination date.

[1] A portion of the acquired loans amounting to $324 million was already recorded as part of the Corporation’s loan portfolio balance, in accordance with U.S. GAAP,

due to the delinquency status of the loans and the Corporation’s right but not the obligation to repurchase the assets.

[2] The repurchased FNMA loans were previously sold with credit recourse and are considered Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) at the time of repurchase.
Therefore, the establishment of the related ACL is recorded as an addition to the purchase price and the loan premium amortized (decrease interest income) over
the life of the loan.

Popular Bank’s New York Branches Realignment
On October 27, 2020, Popular Bank (“PB”), the United States
mainland banking subsidiary of the Corporation, authorized
and approved a strategic realignment of its New York Metro
branch network that resulted in eleven (11) branch closures
and related staffing reductions. The branch closures were
completed on January 29, 2021.

This strategic realignment, which will allow PB to reduce its
operating expenses, leverage resources to enhance its focus on
small and medium size businesses, as well as support changing
customer behaviors, was approved after an assessment of PB’s
current branch network, including its usage, proximity to its
other branches and customer needs. PB will maintain in its New
York Metro region its largest regional retail network in the
located
mainland US, with twenty-seven (27) branches
throughout Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan and Queens, as well as
in northern New Jersey.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded
a total pre-tax charge of approximately $23.2 million related to
the branch realignment. This aggregate pre-tax charge included
approximately $2.1 million associated with severance and
related benefit costs for the 83 impacted employees and charges
of approximately $21.1 million related to the abandonment of
real property leases, including the impairment of right-of-use
assets. The Corporation expects
to incur an additional
$2.0 million in expenses during 2021 related to this initiative

Non-GAAP financial measures
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis
Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, is presented
with its different components on Table 4 for the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared with the same period in 2019,
segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities.

The interest earning assets include investment securities and
loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto
Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are
certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its
agencies and sponsored entities, and certain obligations of the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its agencies and assets held
by the Corporation’s international banking entities. To facilitate
the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest
income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using
the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The
taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense
and other related expense disallowances required by the Puerto
Rico tax law. Under Puerto Rico tax law, the exempt interest
can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. Net
interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Management believes that this presentation

Financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020
The Corporation’s net income for the year ended December 31,
2020 amounted to $506.6 million, compared to a net income of
$671.1 million for 2019. The 24% year-over-year decrease was
largely driven by a higher provision expense, lower fees and
lower net interest income related to the economic disruption
caused by the pandemic.

Critical accounting policies require management to make
estimates and assumptions, which involve significant judgment
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and
that involve a high degree of subjectivity. These estimates are
made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and
changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual
results that differ from those estimates. The following MD&A

The Corporation requires the use of observable inputs when
available, in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs
to determine fair value. The inputs or methodologies used for

valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk
associated with investing in those securities. The amount of
judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial
instrument depends upon the availability of quoted market
prices or observable market parameters. In addition, it may be
affected by other factors such as the type of instrument, the
liquidity of the market for the instrument, transparency around
the inputs
the contractual
characteristics of the instrument.

Broker quotes used for fair value measurements inherently
reflect any lack of liquidity in the market since they represent
an exit price from the perspective of the market participants.
Financial assets that were fair valued using broker quotes
amounted to $6 million at December 31, 2020, of which
$1 million were Level 3 assets and $ 5 million were Level 2
assets. Level 3 assets consisted principally of tax-exempt GNMA
mortgage-backed securities. Fair value for these securities was
based on an internally-prepared matrix derived from local
broker quotes. The main input used in the matrix pricing was
non-binding local broker quotes obtained from limited trade
activity. Therefore, these securities were classified as Level 3.

Trading Debt Securities and Debt Securities
Available-for-Sale
The majority of the values for trading debt securities and debt
securities available-for-sale are obtained from third-party
pricing services and are validated with alternate pricing sources
when available. Securities not priced by a secondary pricing
source are documented and validated internally according to
their significance to the Corporation’s financial statements.
Management has established materiality thresholds according to
the investment class to monitor and investigate material
deviations in prices obtained from the primary pricing service
provider and the secondary pricing source used as support for
the valuation results. During the year ended December 31,
2020, the Corporation did not adjust any prices obtained from
pricing service providers or broker dealers.

available, the pricing service provider generally uses observable
data to derive an exit price for the instrument, such as
benchmark yield curves and trade data for similar products. To
the extent trading data is not available, the pricing service
provider relies on specific information including dialogue with
brokers, buy side clients, credit ratings, spreads to established
benchmarks and transactions on similar securities, to draw
the evaluated
correlations based on the characteristics of

for any reason the pricing service provider
cannot observe data required to feed its model, it discontinues
pricing the instrument. During the year ended December 31,
2020, none of the Corporation’s debt securities were subject to
pricing discontinuance by the pricing service providers. The

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses
Interest on loans is accrued and recorded as interest income
based upon the principal amount outstanding.

Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of
interest is discontinued. When a loan is placed on non-accrual
status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged
against interest income and the loan is accounted for either on a
cash-basis method or on the cost-recovery method. Loans
designated as non-accruing are returned to accrual status when

One of the most critical and complex accounting estimates is

the Corporation establishes an ACL for its loan portfolio based
on its estimate of credit losses over the remaining contractual
term of
in
accordance with ASC Topic 326. An ACL is recognized for all

establish the ACL which includes a reasonable and supportable

loans secured by collateral when foreclosure is probable or
when foreclosure is not probable but the practical expedient is

expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of

based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. The
fair value of the collateral is based on appraisals, which may be
adjusted due to their age, and the type, location, and condition
of the property or area or general market conditions to reflect
the expected change in value between the effective date of the

Corporation recognizes the estimate of the expected credit

loan as an ACL with a corresponding addition to the loan

effective interest method or a method that approximates the
effective interest method. Changes in expected credit losses are
recorded as an increase or decrease to the ACL with a
corresponding charge (reverse) to the provision for credit losses
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Upon transition
to the individual loan measurement, these loans follow the
same nonaccrual policies as non-PCD loans and are therefore
no longer excluded from non-performing status. Modifications
of PCD loans that meet the definition of a TDR subsequent to
the adoption of ASC Topic 326 are accounted and reported as
such following the same processes as non-PCD loans.

loans acquired with
deteriorated credit quality were accounted for under ASC
310-30. Loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 included loans
for which it was probable, at the date of acquisition, that the
Corporation would not collect all contractually required
principal
and loans which the
Corporation elected to account under ASC 310-30 by analogy.
Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, these loans were aggregated into
pools based on loans that have common risk characteristics.
Once the pools were defined, the Corporation maintained the
integrity of the pool of multiple loans accounted for as a single
asset. Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, the difference between the
undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair
value in the loans, or the “accretable yield,” was recognized as
interest
income using the effective yield method over the
estimated life of the loan if the timing and amount of the future
cash flows of the pool was reasonably estimable. Therefore,
these loans were not considered non-performing. Subsequent to
the acquisition date, increases in cash flows over those expected
at the acquisition date were recognized as a reduction of any
ACL established after the acquisition and then as an increase in
the accretable yield for the loans prospectively. Decreases in
expected cash flows after the acquisition date were recognized
by recording an ACL. Charge-offs on loans accounted under
ASC Subtopic 310-30 were recorded only to the extent that
losses exceeded the non-accretable difference established with
purchase accounting.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are
tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis, and attributable to operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years
in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when
the changes are enacted.

The calculation of periodic income taxes is complex and
requires the use of estimates and judgments. The Corporation
has recorded two accruals for income taxes: (i) the net
estimated amount currently due or to be received from taxing
jurisdictions, including any reserve for potential examination
issues, and (ii) a deferred income tax that represents the
estimated impact of temporary differences between how the
Corporation recognizes assets and liabilities under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), and
how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the tax
code. Differences in the actual outcome of these future tax
consequences could impact the Corporation’s financial position
or its results of operations. In estimating taxes, management
assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax
treatment of transactions taking into consideration statutory,
judicial and regulatory guidance.

A deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation
allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence, it is
more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some
portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred
tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is
realizable is based on weighting all available evidence,
including both positive and negative evidence. The realization
of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible
temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient
taxable income of the same character during the carryback or
carryforward period. The realization of deferred tax assets
requires the consideration of all sources of taxable income
available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future
future taxable
reversal of existing temporary differences,
reversing temporary differences and
income exclusive of
carryforwards,
and

Management evaluates the realization of the deferred tax
asset by taxing jurisdiction. The U.S. mainland operations are
evaluated as a whole since a consolidated income tax return is
filed; on the other hand, the deferred tax asset related to the
Puerto Rico operations is evaluated on an entity by entity basis,
since no consolidation is allowed in the income tax filing.
Accordingly,
three major
this evaluation is composed of
components: U.S. mainland operations, Puerto Rico banking
operations and Holding Company.

For the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset

the
Corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable
entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. The
Code provides a dividends-received deduction of 100% on
dividends received from “controlled” subsidiaries subject to
taxation in Puerto Rico and 85% on dividends received from
other taxable domestic corporations.

Changes in the Corporation’s estimates can occur due to
changes in tax rates, new business strategies, newly enacted
guidance, and resolution of
issues with taxing authorities
regarding previously taken tax positions. Such changes could
affect the amount of accrued taxes. The Corporation has made
tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules.

determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in

final tax authority will take a tax position that is different than

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Corporation’s goodwill and other identifiable intangible
assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment.
Intangibles with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment at
least annually, and on a more frequent basis,
if events or
circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place.
Such events could include, among others, a significant adverse
change in the business climate, an adverse action by a regulator,
an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a
decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit.
Other identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life are
evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable.
Goodwill

is recognized when the carrying
amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up to
the amount of the goodwill. Prior to the adoption of ASU

consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations
The Corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans
for certain employees of various subsidiaries. The Corporation
also provides certain health care benefits for retired employees
of BPPR. The non-contributory defined pension and benefit
restoration plans (“the Pension Plans”) are frozen with regards
to all future benefit accruals.

recorded amounts,

The estimated benefit costs and obligations of the Pension
Plans and Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan (“OPEB
Plan”) are impacted by the use of subjective assumptions,
including
which can materially affect
expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, termination
rates, retirement rates and health care trend rates. Management
applies judgment in the determination of these factors, which
normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice
and the actual experience of the Corporation. The Corporation
uses an independent actuarial
firm for assistance in the
determination of the Pension Plans and OPEB Plan costs and
obligations. Detailed information on the Plans and related
valuation assumptions are included in Note 29 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

at December

The Corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the
long-term expected return on Pension Plans assets. The Pension
2020 was
Plans’
$878.8 million. The expected return on plan assets
is
determined by considering various factors, including a total
fund return estimate based on a weighted-average of estimated
returns for each asset class in each plan. Asset class returns are
estimated using current and projected economic and market
factors such as real rates of return, inflation, credit spreads,
equity risk premiums and excess return expectations.

As part of

the review,

the Corporation’s independent
consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns
based on each plan’s expected asset allocation for the year 2021
using the Willis Towers Watson US Expected Return Estimator.
This analysis is reviewed by the Corporation and used as a tool
to develop expected rates of return, together with other data.
This forecast reflects the actuarial firm’s view of expected long-
term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic
indicator; for example, 8.5% for large cap stocks, 8.8% for small
cap stocks, 8.9% for international stocks, 3.3% for long

reviews,

corporate bonds and 2.0% for long Treasury bonds at January 1,
2021. A range of expected investment returns is developed, and
this range relies both on forecasts and on broad-market
historical benchmarks for expected returns, correlations, and
volatilities for each asset class.
As a consequence of

the Corporation
recent
decreased its expected return on plan assets for year 2021 to
4.60% and 5.50% for the Pension Plans. Expected rates of
return of 5.0% and 5.8% had been used for 2020 and 5.3% and
6.0% had been used for 2019 for the Pension Plans. Since the
expected return assumption is on a long-term basis, it is not
materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations (either positive
or negative) in the actual return on assets. The expected return
can be materially impacted by a change in the plan’s asset
allocation.

Net Periodic Benefit Cost (“pension expense”) for the
Pension Plans amounted to $6.2 million in 2020. The total
pension expense included a benefit of $38.1 million for the
expected return on assets.

Pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected
return on assets. For example, decreasing the expected rate of
return for 2020 from 4.60% to 4.35% would increase the
projected 2021 pension expense for the Banco Popular de
Puerto Rico Retirement Plan, the Corporation’s largest plan, by
approximately $2.0 million.

If the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of
plan assets, the Corporation shall recognize a liability equal to
the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa, if the
fair value of plan assets exceeds
the projected benefit
obligation, the Corporation recognizes an asset equal to the
overfunded projected benefit obligation. This asset or liability
may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and
its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or
benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the
financial statements, including other comprehensive income.
The determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations
involves judgment, and any changes in those estimates could
impact the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Financial
Condition. Management believes that the fair value estimates of
the Pension Plans assets are reasonable given the valuation
methodologies used to measure the investments at fair value as
described in Note 27. Also, the compositions of the plan assets
are primarily in equity and debt securities, which have readily
determinable quoted market prices. The Corporation had
recorded a liability for
the underfunded pension benefit
obligation of $35.6 million at December 31, 2020.

The Corporation uses the spot rate yield curve from the
Willis Towers Watson RATE: Link (10/90) Model to discount
the expected projected cash flows of the plans. The equivalent
single weighted average discount rate ranged from 2.41% to
2.48% for the Pension Plans and 2.65% for the OPEB Plan to
determine the benefit obligations at December 31, 2020.

A 50 basis point decrease to each of the rates in the
December 31, 2020 Willis Towers Watson RATE: Link (10/90)
Model would increase the projected 2021 expense for the Banco
Popular de Puerto Rico Retirement Plan by approximately
$2.1 million. The change would not affect
the minimum
required contribution to the Pension Plans.

The OPEB Plan was unfunded (no assets were held by the
plan) at December 31, 2020. The Corporation had recorded a
liability for the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation
of $179.2 million at December 31, 2020.

interest
margin decreased by 74 basis points to 3.29% in 2020,

and agency debt

securities

Negative variances:

• Lower interest income from money market investments due
to lower market rates, partially offset by higher volume
driven mainly by the increase in deposits;

• Lower interest income from investment securities due to
lower rates, partially offset by a higher volume of U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. agency mortgage backed agencies to
deploy liquidity and to benefit from the Puerto Rico tax
exemption of these assets and higher yield; and,

• Lower interest income from loans mainly driven by a lower
amortization on the discount on the portfolio acquired from
Wells Fargo in 2018, waived fees on past due loans
associated to the moratorium granted in connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the decrease in rates
in variable rate loans and new production. These negative
variances were partially offset by higher volume of loans,
mainly PPP, both in Puerto Rico and the U.S., auto loan
financing in BPPR and commercial and mortgage loan
growth in PB.

Positive variances:

• Lower interest expense on deposits driven by lower interest
cost, in both BPPR and PB, which resulted from the decrease
in market rates, as discussed above and management actions
to reduce costs. The cost of interest deposits decreased 47
basis points at the consolidated level and also decreased 47
basis points in BPPR and PB. These decreases in interest
expense were partially offset by a higher average balance of
interest-bearing deposits in most categories mainly driven by
the inflow of deposits from the relief and assistance
programs provided by the Puerto Rico and Federal
governments in response to the pandemic.

$19.0 million in costs related to the termination of real
property leases associated with PB’s New York branch
realignment, including the impairment of the right-of-use

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS
The Corporation’s reportable segments for managerial reporting
purposes consist of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular
U.S. A Corporate group has been defined to support
the
reportable segments.

For a description of the Corporation’s reportable segments,
including additional financial information and the underlying
management accounting process, refer to Note 36 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Corporate group reported a net income of $8.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net
income of $6.1 million for the previous year. The increase in
the net income was mainly attributed to higher non-interest
income by $2.5 million and lower operating expenses by
$1.0 million mainly due to lower profit-sharing plan expense,
partially offset by higher net-interest loss by $1.8 million due to
lower income from money market investments.

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment’s net
income amounted to $499.0 million for
the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared with $609.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019. The results for 2020 were impacted
by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the implementation of
the CECL accounting pronouncement. The principal factors
that contributed to the variance in the financial results included
the following:

• Lower net interest income by $40.4 million due to lower
interest income from loans by $51.0 million and lower
investments and debt
income from money market
securities by $97.9 million, reflective of
lower rates;
partially offset by lower interest expense from deposits by
$107.6 million. The BPPR segment’s net interest margin
was 3.40% for 2020 compared with 4.30% for the same
period in 2019;

• Higher provision for credit losses by $75.5 million mainly
due to the implementation of CECL and the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the macroeconomic outlook;

• Lower non-interest income by $60.8 million mainly due

to:

• Lower service charges on deposit accounts by
$9.7 million due to lower transactions and the
temporary waiver of

Popular U.S.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the reportable segment
of Popular U.S. reported net loss of $0.7 million, compared
with a net
income of $55.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The principal factors that contributed to
the variance in the financial results included the following:

• Higher net interest income by $7.0 million mainly due to
lower income from loans by $9.6 million due to lower
rates, offset by higher volumes of PPP loans, and lower
income from money market
investments and debt
securities by $12.6 million, reflective of lower market
rates, partially offset by lower interest expense from

to predict. The amount and timing of any such
reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the timeline
of current debt restructuring efforts under Title III of the Puerto
Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act
(“PROMESA”) and the speed at which the Coronavirus Aid,
Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) assistance is
distributed. Generally, these deposits require high credit quality
securities as collateral. Therefore, while there can be timing
differences between the deposit outflow and the release of
collateral, generally the liquidity risks from public deposit
outflows are lower. Refer to Table 8 for a breakdown of the

REGULATORY CAPITAL
The Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to capital
adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board.
The risk-based capital standards applicable to Popular, Inc. and
the Banks, BPPR and PB, are based on the final capital
framework of Basel III. The capital rules of Basel III include a
“Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”) capital measure and
specifies that Tier 1 capital consist of CET1 and “Additional
Tier 1 Capital” instruments meeting specified requirements.

Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements presents
further information on the Corporation’s regulatory capital
requirements,
its
depository institutions, BPPR and PB.

including the regulatory capital ratios of

An institution is considered “well-capitalized” if it maintains
a total capital ratio of 10%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%, a CET1
ratio of 6.5% and a leverage ratio of 5%. The
capital
Corporation’s ratios presented in Table 9 show that
the
Corporation was “well capitalized” for regulatory purposes, the
highest classification, under Basel III for years 2016 through
2020. BPPR and PB were also well-capitalized for all years
presented.

these minimum risk-weighted asset

The Basel III Capital Rules also require an additional 2.5%
“capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on
top of
ratios, which
excludes the leverage ratio. The capital conservation buffer is
designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.
Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted
assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation
buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases,
and compensation based on the amount of
the shortfall.
Popular, BPPR and PB are required to maintain this additional
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, resulting in
minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least
7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%,
and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.

On April 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the final rule
issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies pursuant to
the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1996 that simplified several requirements in the agencies’
regulatory capital rules. These rules simplified the regulatory
capital requirement
for mortgage servicing assets (MSAs),
deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and
investments
capital of unconsolidated financial
institutions by raising the CET1 deduction threshold from 10%
to 25%. The 15% CET1 deduction threshold which applies to
the aggregate amount of such items was eliminated. The rule
also requires, among other changes, increasing from 100% to
250% the risk weight
to MSAs and temporary difference
deferred tax asset not deducted from capital. For investments in
institutions, the risk
the capital of unconsolidated financial
weight would be based on the exposure category of
the
investment.

The decrease in the CET1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio,
total capital ratio and leverage ratio as of December 31, 2020
compared to December 31, 2019 was mostly due to the
accelerated common stock repurchase of $500 million and the
increase in risk weighted assets driven by the increase from
100% to 250% in the risk weight assets of MSAs and temporary
difference deferred tax asset not deducted from capital,

Pursuant to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the
Corporation elected to use the five-year transition period option
as provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective
March 31,2020. The five-year transition period provision delays
for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory
capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out
the aggregate amount of the capital benefits provided during
the initial two-year delay.
On April 9, 2020,

federal banking regulators issued an
interim final rule to modify the Basel III regulatory capital rules

the Corporation and its Bank
subsidiaries, are permitted to assign a zero percent risk weight
to PPP loans for purposes of determining risk-weighted assets

routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk
to meet
customers. These
commitments may include loan commitments and standby
letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same
credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet
instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the statement of financial position. Other types of
off-balance sheet arrangements that the Corporation enters in

POPULAR, INC. 2020 ANNUAL REPORT

At December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s liability on its
pension, restoration and postretirement benefit plans amounted
to approximately $215 million, compared with $221 million at
December 31, 2019. The Corporation’s expected contributions
to the pension and benefit restoration plans are minimal, while
the expected contributions to the postretirement benefit plan to
fund current benefit payment requirements are estimated at
$6.3 million for 2021. Obligations to these plans are based on
current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of
the plan assets, if applicable, and any participant contributions.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Market / Interest Rate Risk
The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are
constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks.

Market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the
Corporation’s capital due to changes in the market valuation of
its assets and/or liabilities.

Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt
securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 and 6
for further information on the debt securities available-for-sale
and held-to-maturity portfolios. Debt securities classified as

available-for-sale amounted to $21.6 billion as of December 31,
2020. Other assets subject
risk include loans
held-for-sale, which amounted to $99 million, mortgage

Net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal
entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the
Corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest
income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates.
Sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model
which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by
maturity and interest yields or costs.

Management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various
NII simulations under different interest rate scenarios that
differ in direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change
and the projected shape of the yield curve. For example, the
types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat

instantaneous parallel changes of -100, -200, +100, +200 and
+400 basis points during the succeeding twelve-month period.
Simulation analyses are based on many assumptions, including
relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve
points and indexes, interest rate spreads, loan prepayments and
deposit elasticity. Thus, they should not be relied upon as
indicative of actual results. Further,
the estimates do not
contemplate actions that management could take to respond to
changes in interest rates. By their nature, these forward-looking
computations are only estimates and may be different from
what may actually occur in the future. The following table
presents the results of the simulations at December 31, 2020
and December 31, 2019, assuming a static balance sheet and
parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time
horizon:

As of December 31, 2020, NII simulations show the
Corporation maintains an asset sensitive position and is
expected to benefit from an overall rising rate environment.
The changes in sensitivity for the period are primarily driven by
large deposit increases of over $13 billion along with reductions
in the rates paid for deposit products. Overall, rates are now
considered to be close to their “lower bound” because we
currently assume, in our interest risk models, that rates will not
reach negative values. This has the effect of reducing sensitivity
in most products given that rates are close to zero in most curve
tenors and therefore have little room to fall further in the
declining rates scenarios. We would expect this “flooring” effect
on sensitivity to declining rates to reverse itself if rates were to

scenarios notably increased as most of the increase in deposits
remained in short-term assets and cash at the close of the
quarter.

Certain derivative contracts also present credit risk and
liquidity risk because the counterparties may not comply with
the terms of the contract, or the collateral obtained might be
illiquid or become so. The Corporation controls credit risk
through approvals,
limits and monitoring procedures, and
through master netting and collateral agreements whenever
possible. Further, as applicable under the terms of the master
agreements,
the Corporation may obtain collateral, where
appropriate, to reduce credit risk. The credit risk attributed to the
counterparty’s nonperformance risk is incorporated in the fair
value of the derivatives. Additionally, as required by the fair value
measurements guidance, the fair value of the Corporation’s own
credit standing is considered in the fair value of the derivative

inclusion of the credit risk in the fair value of the derivatives,

Cash Flow Hedges
The Corporation manages the variability of cash payments due
to interest rate fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges and that are linked to specified
hedged assets and liabilities. The cash flow hedges relate to
forward contracts or TBA mortgage-backed securities that are
sold and bought for future settlement to hedge mortgage-
backed securities and loans prior to securitization. The seller
agrees to deliver on a specified future date a specified
instrument at a specified price or yield. These securities are
hedging a forecasted transaction and are designated for cash
flow hedge accounting. The notional amount of derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2020 amounted
to $ 189 million (2019 - $ 98 million).

The Corporation has over-the-counter option contracts
which are utilized in order to limit the Corporation’s exposure
on customer deposits whose returns are tied to the S&P 500 or
to certain other equity securities or commodity indexes. The
Corporation offers certificates of deposit with returns linked to
these indexes to its retail customers, principally in connection
with individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and certificates of
deposit. At December 31, 2020, these deposits amounted to

institutions with strong credit standings, whose return is
designed to match the return payable on the certificates of

cost of these deposits is fixed. The contracts have a maturity
and an index equal to the terms of the pool of retail deposits

The purchased option contracts are initially accounted for at

derivative asset. The derivative asset is marked-to-market on a
quarterly basis with changes in fair value charged to earnings.
The deposits are hybrid instruments containing embedded

derivatives and hedging activities guidance. The initial value of
the embedded option (component of the deposit contract that
pays a return based on changes in the applicable indexes) is

Liquidity
The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure
that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its
financial obligations,
fund
planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety
margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed
market conditions. The Board of Directors is responsible for
establishing the Corporation’s tolerance for liquidity risk,
including approving relevant risk limits and policies. The Board
of Directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the
Board’s Risk Management Committee and the Asset/Liability
Management Committee. The management of liquidity risk, on
a long-term and day-to-day basis, is the responsibility of the
Corporate Treasury Division. The Corporation’s Corporate
Treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and
procedures approved by the Board of Directors and for
monitoring the Corporation’s liquidity position on an ongoing
basis. Also,
the Corporate Treasury Division coordinates
corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities
with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and
manages the escalation process. The Financial and Operational
Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent
monitoring and reporting of adherence with established
policies.

An institution’s liquidity may be pressured if, for example, it
experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow
due to exogenous events such as the current COVID-19
pandemic, its credit rating is downgraded, or some other event
causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution.
Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the
economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets and
regulatory changes, could also affect
its ability to obtain
funding.

Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of the
holding companies that own the banking and non-banking
subsidiaries. It is also managed at the level of the banking and
non-banking subsidiaries. As
further explained below, a
principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies

Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to model
various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting
different time horizons that assist management in evaluating
the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events
occur. However, such models may not predict accurately how
the market and customers might react to every event, and are
dependent on many assumptions.

Corporation’s total assets at December 31, 2020 and 84% at
December 31, 2019. The ratio of total ending loans to deposits
was 52% at December 31, 2020, compared to 63% at
December 31, 2019. In addition to traditional deposits, the
Corporation maintains

borrowing
amounted to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020
(December 31, 2019 - $1.3 billion). A detailed description of
the Corporation’s borrowings, including their terms, is included
in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the
Corporation’s cash inflows and outflows.

As previously mentioned, during 2020 the Corporation
executed actions corresponding to its capital and liquidity
strategic plans. These included the $500 million accelerated
share repurchase transaction with respect to its common stock
and an increase in quarterly common stock dividend from
$0.30 per share to $0.40 per share. Refer to additional details of
these transactions in Notes 19 - Stockholders Equity and Note
30 - Net Income Per Common Share.

The following sections provide further information on the
Corporation’s major funding activities and needs, as well as the
risks involved in these activities.

Banking Subsidiaries
Primary sources of
funding for the Corporation’s banking
subsidiaries (BPPR and PB or, collectively, “the banking
subsidiaries”) include retail, commercial and public sector
deposits, brokered deposits, unpledged investment securities,
mortgage loan securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales.
In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with
the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York (the “FRB”) and has a considerable amount
of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these
facilities.

such as deposit outflows. The Corporation has established
liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to
have sufficient liquidity to cover all short-term borrowings and
a portion of deposits.

The Corporation’s ability to compete successfully in the
marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends
on various factors, including pricing, service, convenience and
financial stability as reflected by operating results, credit ratings
(by nationally
and
importantly, FDIC deposit insurance. Although a downgrade in
the credit ratings of the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries may
impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or
the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits, management
does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at

all of
the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries are federally
insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate
the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.

Deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less
volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less
sensitive to changes in market rates. Refer to Table 8 for a
breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are
generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and public
sector customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing
deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit under
$100,000, excluding brokered deposits with denominations
under $100,000. Core deposits have historically provided the
Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and
low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled $ 51.7 billion, or 91% of
compared with
at December 31, 2020,
total deposits,
$38.8 billion, or 89% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019.
Core deposits financed 82% of the Corporation’s earning assets
at December 31, 2020, compared with 80% at December 31,
2019.

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with
denominations of $100,000 and over at December 31, 2020 is

The Corporation had $ 0.8 billion in brokered deposits at
December 31, 2020, which financed approximately 1% of its
total assets(December 31, 2019 - $0.5 billion and 1%,
respectively). In the event that any of the Corporation’s banking
subsidiaries’ regulatory capital ratios fall below those required
by a well-capitalized institution or are subject
to capital
restrictions by the regulators, that banking subsidiary faces the
risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and
faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits, which may hinder
the Corporation’s ability to effectively compete in its retail
markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts.

Deposits from the public sector represent an important
source of funds for the Corporation. As of December 31, 2020,
total public sector deposits were $15.1 billion, compared to
$10.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Generally, these deposits
require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as
collateral; therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector
deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its
collateral in return. This, now unpledged, collateral can either
be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash.
However, there are some timing differences between the time
the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its
collateral.

the
At December 31, 2020, management believes that
banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected
liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations,
as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in
the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity
resources to address a stress event. Although the banking
subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing
deposits and advances, no assurance can be given that they
would be able to replace those funds in the future if the
Corporation’s financial condition or general market conditions
were to deteriorate. The Corporation’s financial flexibility will
be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to
maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not
available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable
interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to
deposit
to meet margin
cash or qualifying
the value of securities
requirements. To the extent
previously pledged as collateral declines because of market
changes, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional
cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby
is
adversely affecting its liquidity. Finally,
required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding
sources to meet its future growth, revenues may not increase
proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would
be adversely affected.

The BHCs have in the past borrowed in the money markets
and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their
the
non-banking subsidiaries; however,
Corporation’s non-banking subsidiaries other than to repay
indebtedness and interest are now minimal. These sources of
funding have become more costly due to the Corporation’s
principal credit rating being below “investment grade”, which
affects the Corporation’s ability to raise funds in the capital
markets. The Corporation has an automatic shelf registration
statement filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an
unspecified amount of debt or equity securities.

The outstanding balance of notes payable at the BHCs

2020, the Corporation redeemed all the outstanding shares of
2008 Series B Preferred Stock. Refer to Note 19 for additional
information. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the
BHC’s received dividends amounting to $578 million from
BPPR, $13 million from PIBI which main source of income is
derived from its investment in BHD, $8 million in dividends
from its non-banking subsidiaries and $2 million in dividends
from EVERTEC. Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular,
Inc.’s primary source of liquidity.

Other Funding Sources and Capital
The debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of
liquidity, which may be realized through either securities sales
or repurchase agreements. The Corporation’s debt securities
portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government debt
securities, U.S. government sponsored agency debt securities,
U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities,
and U.S. government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage
obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets.

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
A significant portion of our financial activities and credit
exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
(the “Commonwealth” or “Puerto Rico”), which faces severe
economic and fiscal challenges.

COVID-19 Pandemic
On December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19)
surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally to
other countries and jurisdictions,
including the mainland
United States and Puerto Rico. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The
pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted
the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created
significant volatility in financial markets, and increased
unemployment levels worldwide, including in the markets in
which we do business. In Puerto Rico, former Governor Wanda
Vázquez issued an executive order on March 15, 2020 declaring
a health emergency, ordering residents to shelter in place,
implementing a mandatory curfew, and requiring the closure of
for businesses that provide essential
all businesses, except
services,
institutions with
respect to certain services. While many of the restrictions have
been gradually lifted, a mandatory curfew is still in effect and
most businesses have had to make significant adjustments to
protect customers and employees, including transitioning to
telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in
compliance with health and safety guidelines.

including banking and financial

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue
to have an adverse effect on economic activity in Puerto Rico in
the long-term will depend on future developments, which are
highly uncertain and is difficult to predict, including the scope
and duration of the pandemic, the restrictions imposed by
governmental authorities and other third parties in response to
the same and the amount of federal and local assistance offered
to offset the impact of the pandemic. However, the COVID-19
pandemic and the actions taken by governments in response to
the same have had a material adverse effect on economic
activity worldwide, including in Puerto Rico, and there can be
no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities
will be sufficient to offset the pandemic’s economic impact.

regarding the projections of the 2020 Fiscal Plan (defined
below) with respect to the impact of the pandemic, see Fiscal
Plans, Commonwealth Fiscal Plan, below.

Economic Performance
The Commonwealth’s economy entered a recession in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product
(“GNP”) contracted (in real terms) every fiscal year between
2007 and 2018, with the exception of fiscal year 2012. Pursuant
to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the “Planning Board”)
estimates, dated June 2020, the Commonwealth’s real GNP for
fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 3.2% and 4.2%,
respectively. The Planning Board estimates that real GNP
increased approximately 1.5% in fiscal year 2019 due to the
influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair
damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and María, and that it
decreased approximately -5.4% in fiscal year 2020 due
primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the measures taken by the government in response to the same.
Finally, the Planning Board projected that the negative effects
of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021,
resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2% in
the current fiscal year.

Fiscal Crisis
The Commonwealth remains in the midst of a profound fiscal
crisis affecting the central government and many of
its
instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities. This
fiscal crisis has been primarily the result of economic
contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high
debt burden, unfunded legacy obligations, and lack of access to
the capital markets, among other factors. As a result of the
crisis, the Commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities
have been unable to make debt service payments on their

President to select the members from several lists required to be

leaders and which process was
recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The terms of the
original Oversight Board members expired in August 2019, but
PROMESA allows members to remain in their roles until their
successors have been appointed. All of the original members

designated all of the Commonwealth’s municipalities as covered
entities. At the Oversight Board’s request, covered entities are
required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the
Oversight Board for its review and approval. They are also

established a schedule for a proposed revision to the 2020
Fiscal Plan to incorporate new information regarding Puerto
Rico’s macroeconomic environment and government revenues
and expenditures and to incorporate the impact of expenses
related to the potential certification of a plan of adjustment for
the Commonwealth under Title III of PROMESA. Pursuant to
the schedule, the Governor is required to submit a proposed
updated fiscal plan to the Oversight Board by February 20,
2021, and the Oversight Board expects to certify a revised
updated fiscal plan by April 23, 2021.

The 2020 Fiscal Plan estimates that the economy of Puerto
Rico will contract by 4% in real terms in fiscal year 2020,
largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a limited recovery
of 0.5% in fiscal year 2021. The 2020 Fiscal Plan estimates that
this economic contraction will exacerbate the Commonwealth
government’s fiscal challenges. As a result of these changes, the
2020 Fiscal Plan projects that the Commonwealth will have a

The 2020 Fiscal Plan provides for the gradual reduction and
the ultimate elimination of Commonwealth budgetary subsidies
to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the
operating revenues of certain municipalities. Since fiscal year
2017, Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have
been reduced by approximately 64% (from approximately
$370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $132 million
in fiscal year 2020). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the
2020 Fiscal Plan provided for a one-year pause on reductions to
appropriations to municipalities. Accordingly, appropriations to
municipalities for fiscal year 2021 remained at $132 million,
rather than declining by $44 million as contemplated by the
prior fiscal plan. In addition, the Governor signed an executive
order that adopts the “Strategic Plan for Disbursement” of the
$2.2 billion allocated to Puerto Rico by the Coronavirus Relief
Fund created by the Federal Government through the CARES
Act. Such plan assigns $100 million to municipalities for

PROMESA Adversary Proceeding
In 2019,
the Oversight Board commenced an adversary
proceeding against the Commonwealth seeking to invalidate
Act 29-2019 (“Act 29”), which eliminated the obligation of
municipalities to contribute to the Commonwealth’s health
plan and pay-as-you-go retirement system, on the grounds that
Act 29 was inconsistent with the Commonwealth’s fiscal plan.
On April 15, 2020, the Judge ruled in favor of the Oversight
Board and declared Act 29 “unenforceable and of no effect.”
Judge Swain delayed the effective date of the opinion and order
for three weeks, through May 6, 2020, to provide time for the
Government and the Oversight Board to agree on a mechanism
for the reimbursement to the Commonwealth of approximately
$166 million and $32 million, respectively, on account of
retirement and health plan obligations due by municipalities as
a result of the invalidation of Act 29. Subsequent to the Court’s
decision, the Oversight Board, the Government and CRIM,
which is the entity primarily responsible for the collection of
property taxes for the municipalities, made various proposals to
resolve the immediate fiscal impact of Act 29’s invalidation. On
May 6, 2020, the Government filed a motion informing the
Court that CRIM had agreed to accept a proposal by the
Oversight Board to reverse a $132 million transfer from the
Commonwealth to the municipalities in the Commonwealth’s
fiscal year 2020 budget (to be allocated among municipalities)
to offset
approximately $198 million obligation of
municipalities for the health plan and pay-as-you go retirement
system payments
remaining
$66 million would have to be repaid by municipalities by the
end of fiscal year 2022 from other sources of revenue. There
continue to be differences between the Government and the
Oversight Board as to the calculation of the municipalities
obligation for the health plan and retirement system payments,
as well as to long-term solutions to the fiscal consequences to
the municipalities of Act 29’s invalidation. The effect of the
court’s decision and the implementation of the offset proposal
finances is likely to vary

Exposure of the Corporation
The credit quality of BPPR’s loan portfolio reflects, among other
things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and
other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and
businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession have been
reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of
foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico.
While PROMESA provides
the
Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis, the length and complexity of the
Title III proceedings for the Commonwealth and various of its
instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the
fiscal plans present significant economic risks. In addition, the
COVID-19 outbreak has affected many of our individual
customers and customers’ businesses. This, when added to
Puerto Rico’s ongoing fiscal crisis and recession, could cause
credit losses that adversely affect us and may negatively affect
consumer confidence,
in consumer
spending, and adversely impact our interest and non-interest
revenues. If global or local economic conditions worsen or the
Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board are unable
to adequately manage the Commonwealth’s fiscal and economic
challenges, including by controlling the adverse impact of the
orderly

restructuring of the Commonwealth’s debt obligations while

mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance
Authority (“HFA”), a governmental instrumentality that has
been designated as
covered entity under PROMESA
(December 31, 2019 - $276 million). These mortgage loans are
secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties
and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower
default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions.
The Corporation also had, at December 31, 2020, $46 million
in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage
loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA
also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a
borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of certain other
conditions (December 31, 2019 - $46 million). In the event that
the mortgage loans

Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA
bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the
outstanding balance of this loans, HFA’s ability to honor its
insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial
condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and

the effects of

The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and
economic challenges, which have been and maybe be further
exacerbated as a result of
the COVID-19
pandemic, and which could adversely affect the ability of its
public corporations and instrumentalities to service their
outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the
USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation
permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its
public corporations and instrumentalities.

To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues
to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the
USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the
financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a
stay on creditor remedies,
including by making PROMESA

At December 31, 2020, the Corporation’s direct exposure to

Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority, a public corporation
of the USVI that operates USVI’s water production and electric

$17 million, $8 million, and $0, respectively, at December 31,
2019). The increase in the exposure to the VI PFA from
December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 is due to the
purchase by BPPR of $30 million of Series 2020A-1 Tax
Revenue Anticipation Notes of the VI PFA in December 2020,
which are secured by a statutory lien on income taxes real

the U.S. Government or its agencies at December 31, 2020
(compared to $1.1 billion, $0 and $66 million, respectively, at

Non-Performing Assets
Non-performing assets (“NPAs”) include primarily past-due
loans that are no longer accruing interest, renegotiated loans,
and real estate property acquired through foreclosure. A
summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented
in Table 23.

The Corporation adopted the CECL accounting standard
effective January 1, 2020. This framework requires management
to estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of
the loan using economic forecasts over a reasonable and
supportable period, and historical information thereafter.

The year 2020 was impacted by the unprecedented events
that have unfolded as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Notwithstanding,
the Corporation’s credit quality remained
stable, aided by payment deferrals and government stimulus
measures instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The financial relief granted to eligible borrowers in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, comprised mainly of payment

deferrals of up to six months, largely ended during the third
quarter of 2020. Management continues to closely follow
macroeconomic conditions and although the outlook indicates
improvements, the full effects of the pandemic and the pace of
the recovery remains uncertain. The improvement over the last
few years in the risk profile of the Corporation’s loan portfolios
positions Popular to operate successfully under the ongoing
challenging environment. We will continue to carefully monitor
the exposure of the portfolios to the COVID-19 pandemic
related risks, changes in the economic outlook of the regions in
which Popular operates and how delinquencies and NCOs
evolve.

impaired (“PCI’)

Total NPAs increased by $174 million when compared
with December 31, 2019. Total non-performing
loans
held-in-portfolio increased by $210 million from December 31,
2019, impacted by the adoption of the CECL methodology
during the first quarter of 2020. Following existing accounting
guidance, purchased credit
loans were
excluded from non-performing status due to the estimation of
cash flows at the pool level. Under CECL, these loans are
accounted for on an individual
loan basis under PCD
accounting methodology and are no longer excluded from
non-performing status. BPPR’s NPLs increased by $201 million,
transition impact of
mostly related to the PCI
$260 million, while Popular Bank’s NPLs
increased by
$9 million. Excluding this impact, BPPR’s NPLs decreased by
$59 million, mainly due to lower commercial and consumer
(mostly auto) NPLs of $56 million and $21 million,
respectively. The decrease in commercial NPLs was mostly
related to loans charged-off during the period, combined with
payment activity. The decrease in the consumer NPLs was
mostly related to auto loans, aided by payment deferrals,
government
resumption of
collection efforts. These NPLs reductions were in part offset by
the addition of a $22 million construction relationship. Popular
Bank’s NPLs increase of $9 million was mostly driven by a
$9 million construction NPL inflow during the third quarter of
2020, related to a single borrower from the New York region.
At December 31, 2020,
loans
held-in-portfolio was 2.5% compared to 1.9% at the end of
2019. In addition, non-performing loans-held-for-sale (“LHFS’)
increased by $3 million, driven by taxi medallion loans, and

$173 million at December 31, 2020,
$113 million at December 31, 2019. The CRE NPL ratios for
the BPPR and PB segments were 4.51% and 0.07%, respectively,
at December 31, 2020, compared with 2.88% and 0.07%,
respectively, at December 31, 2019.
In addition to the NPLs

included in Table 23, at
December 31, 2020, there were $228 million of performing
loans, mostly commercial
loans, which in management’s
opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification
as non-performing and are considered impaired (December 31,
2019 - $207 million).

at
same period in 2019. As
December 31, 2020, 94% of loans, after excluding government
guaranteed loans, for which the COVID-19 moratoriums had
expired were current on their payments. Inflows of NPLs
held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment increased by $89 million,
or 32%, compared to the year ended 2019, driven by higher
mortgage inflows by $87 million, mostly due to the delinquency
progression at
the payment moratorium.
Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the PB segment increased
by $35 million, or 173%, from the same period in 2019, mostly
due to higher mortgage and construction inflows of $18 million
and $9 million, respectively. The construction increase was
driven by the single borrower mentioned above.

[1] The increase in non-accrual loans during 2020 includes the initial impact of $278 million related to the adoption of CECL on the portfolio of previously
purchased credit deteriorated loans. This included mortgage loans for $133 million, commercial loans for $131 million and $14 million in consumer loans.
[2] The legacy portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as

part of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at the PB reportable segment.

[5]

[3] There were $3 million in non-performing commercial loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2020 and none for the years December 31, 2019 and 2018.
[4] The carrying value of loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 that are contractually 90 days or more past due was $153 million at December 31, 2019
(December 31, 2018 - $216 million). This amount is excluded from the above table as the loans’ accretable yield interest recognition is independent from the
underlying contractual loan delinquency status.
It is the Corporation’s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more
as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. The balance of these loans includes $57 million at December 31, 2020 related to the
rebooking of loans previously pooled into GNMA securities, in which the Corporation had a buy-back option as further described below (December 31, 2019 -
$103 million; December 31, 2018 - $134 million). Under the GNMA program, issuers such as BPPR have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans
that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to the repurchase option are required to be reflected (rebooked) on the financial
statements of BPPR with an offsetting liability. While the borrowers for our serviced GNMA portfolio benefited from the moratorium, the delinquency status of
these loans continued to be reported to GNMA without considering the moratorium. These balances include $329 million of residential mortgage loans insured
by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 - $213 million; December 31, 2018 - $283
million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $60 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not
accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation’s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31,
2019 - $65 million; December 31, 2018 - $69 million).

[1] The legacy portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as part

of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at the PB reportable segment.
[2] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
[3] The amount consists of $3 million in non-performing loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20 and $20 million in covered OREO at December 31, 2017
(December 31, 2016 - $4 million and $32 million, respectively). It excludes covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 as they are considered to be
performing due to the application of the accretion method, in which these loans will accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loans using estimated
cash flow analyses.

[5]

[4] The carrying value of loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 that are contractually 90 days or more past due was $153 million at December 31, 2017
(December 31, 2016 - $282 million). This amount is excluded from the above table as the loans’ accretable yield interest recognition is independent from the
underlying contractual loan delinquency status.
It is the Corporation’s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more
as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. These balances include $178 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or
guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $181 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has
approximately $58 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of
the loans, it is the Corporation’s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31, 2016 - $68 million).

[6] These asset quality ratios have been adjusted to remove the impact of covered loans. Appropriate adjustments to the numerator and denominator have been
reflected in the calculation of these ratios. Management believes the inclusion of acquired loans in certain asset quality ratios that include non-performing assets,
past due loans or net charge-offs in the numerator and denominator results in distortions of these ratios and they may not be comparable to other periods
presented or to other portfolios that were not impacted by purchase accounting.

(“FHA”), or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) (December 31, 2019 - $441 million).

Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)
The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard
effective on January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses
(“ACL”), represents management’s estimate of expected credit
losses through the remaining contractual life of the different
loan segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL is
maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit
losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt
the loan
restructurings separately from the remainder of
portfolio. The Corporation’s management
the
adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation,
management considers current conditions, macroeconomic
economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable
period, historical loss experience, portfolio composition by loan
type and risk characteristics, results of periodic credit reviews
of individual loans, and regulatory requirements, amongst other
factors.

NCOs for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to
$186.4 million, decreasing by $71.0 million when compared to
the same period in 2019. The BPPR segment decreased by
$33.6 million mainly driven by lower mortgage and commercial
NCOs by $21.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively, due to
the effect of the pandemic relief programs, partially offset by
higher consumer NCOs by $5.8 million. The PB segment

Table 34 - Allowance for Credit Losses - Loan Portfolios

decreased by $37.4 million, mainly driven by lower commercial
NCOs by $33.6 million, as the prior year included charge-offs
from the taxi medallion portfolio. The Corporation continues to
be attentive to changes in delinquencies and NCOs, as most
deferrals expired during the third quarter of 2020 and given the
uncertainty around the outlook of the pandemic.

Troubled debt restructurings
The Corporation’s troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) loans
amounted to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020, increasing by
$81 million, or approximately 5.08%, from December 31, 2019,
mainly due to borrowers that needed additional loss mitigation
alternatives, beyond the 6-month moratorium period granted
under the COVID-19 program. TDRs in the BPPR segment
increased by $82 million, mostly related to higher mortgage
TDRs by $56 million, of which $30 million were related to
government guaranteed loans, coupled with a combined
increase of $35 million in the commercial and construction
TDRs, mainly due to a $21 million construction loan, partially
offset by a decrease of $9 million in the consumer portfolio.

The PB segment decreased by $2 million from the prior year.
TDRs in accruing status increased by $61 million from
December 31, 2019, mostly related to BPPR mortgage TDRs,
while non-accruing TDRs increased by $20 million.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 2020
the Corporation has entered into loan modifications with
eligible customers in mortgage, personal loans, credit cards,
auto loans and leases and certain commercial credit facilities,
comprised mainly of payment deferrals of up to six months,
subject to certain terms and conditions. In addition, certain
participating clients impacted by the seismic activity in the
Southern region of the island also benefitted from other loan
payment moratoriums offered by the Corporation since

mid-January 2020. These loan modifications do not affect the
asset quality measures as the deferred payments are not deemed
to be delinquent and the Corporation continues to accrue
interest on these loans. The Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly

Additionally, the CARES Act, signed by the President of the
United States as part of an economic stimulus package, provides
relief related to U.S. GAAP requirements for loan modifications
related to COVID-19 relief measures. This
relief was
subsequently extended until the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60
days after the national COVID-19 emergency ends. In addition,
the Federal Reserve, along with other U.S. banking regulators,
also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that

COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or
less) granted to consumer or commercial
loans that were
current as of the date of the loan modification are not TDRs,
since the lender can conclude that the borrower is current on
their loan and thus not experiencing financial difficulties and

the lender. In addition, a modification or deferral program that
is mandated by the federal government or a state government
(e.g., a state program that requires all institutions within that
state to suspend mortgage payments for a specified period) does
not represent a TDR. Out of the approximately $8.3 billion in
loans modified under this program, approximately $35 million
have been classified as TDRs. In making this determination, the
Corporation considered the criteria of whether the borrower
was in financial difficulty at the time of the deferral and
whether the deferral period was more than insignificant.

Note: Average loan balances include the average balance of non-accruing loans. No interest income is recognized for these loans in accordance with the Corporation’s

policy.
