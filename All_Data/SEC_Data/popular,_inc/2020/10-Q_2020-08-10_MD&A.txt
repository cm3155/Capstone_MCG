 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This report includes management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;) of the consolidated financial position and financial performance of Popular, Inc. (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221; or &#8220;Popular&#8221;). All accompanying tables, financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report should be considered an integral part of this analysis. 

&#160; 

The Corporation is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation has operations in Puerto Rico, the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) mainland and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its principal banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#8220;BPPR&#8221;), as well as investment banking, broker-dealer, auto and equipment leasing and financing, and insurance services through specialized subsidiaries. The Corporation&#8217;s mortgage origination business is conducted under the brand name Popular Mortgage, a division of BPPR. In the U.S. mainland, the Corporation provides retail, mortgage and commercial banking services through its New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Popular Bank (&#8220;PB&#8221;), which has branches located in New York, New Jersey and Florida . Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents information about the Corporation&#8217;s business segments. 

&#160; 

The Corporation has several investments which it accounts for under the equity method. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation had a 16.22 % interest in EVERTEC, Inc., whose operating subsidiaries provide transaction processing services throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, and service many of the Corporation&#8217;s systems infrastructure and transaction processing businesses. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation recorded $ 2.4 million in earnings from its investment in EVERTEC, which had a carrying amount of $76 million as of the end of the quarter. Also, the Corporation had a 15.84% equity interest in Centro Financiero BHD Le&#243;n, S.A. (&#8220;BHD Le&#243;n&#8221;), one of the largest banking and financial services groups in the Dominican Republic. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation recorded $8.1 million in earnings from its investment in BHD Le&#243;n, which had a carrying amount of $142 million, as of the end of the quarter. 

&#160; 

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS 

&#160; 

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s results for the second quarter of 2020 reflect the impact of the continued business disruption caused by the pandemic, the relief measures implemented by the Corporation and by the federal, state and local governments in response thereto. Certain of the measures imposed by the governments of Puerto Rico, the United States mainland and United States Virgin Islands, including lockdowns, business closures, mandatory curfews and limits to public activities, were relaxed late in the second quarter of 2020 to allow for the gradual reopening of the economy. Nevertheless, economic activity was negatively impacted by the pandemic 

&#160; 

throughout the quarter, which in turn impacted our financial results. The recent regional resurgence in the spread of the virus has also led to the reinstitution of certain restrictive health and safety measures. For example, in July 16, 2020, as a result of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases on the Island, the Government of Puerto Rico scaled back measures to reopen the economy, including by further restricting non-essential business establishments and public activities. 

&#160; 

As previously disclosed, the Corporation implemented several financial relief programs in response to the pandemic, including payment moratoriums, suspensions of foreclosures and other collection activity, as well as waivers of certain fees and service charges, such as late-payment charges and ATM transaction fees. In the case of Puerto Rico, the moratoriums for all consumer products are mandated by local law. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation had granted a loan payment moratorium to 116,226 eligible retail customers with an aggregate book value of $3.9 billion, and to 5,003 eligible commercial clients with an aggregate book value of $4.1 billion. Refer to Table 28 for a breakdown of loan modifications completed by the Corporation as part of the COVID-19 relief measures as of June 30, 2020. COVID -related moratoriums began in March of 2020 and are set to expire between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, depending on the loan product and deferral agreements with the borrowers. Other clients benefitted from moratoriums since mid-January 2020 as a result of various areas of Puerto Rico being declared disaster areas as a result of the January earthquakes. 

&#160; 

The delinquency status of loans subject to the Corporation&#8217;s payment moratorium programs remains unaltered during the payment deferral period and the Corporation continues to accrue interest income during such term. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation had secured funding approval for over 28,000 loans totaling approximately $1.4 billion under the Small Business Administration&#8217;s (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Payroll Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). Approximately $1.2 billion of such loans were granted in Puerto Rico, $215 million in the mainland United States and $29 million in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The average size of loans extended under the PPP was approximately $45,000 in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and $152,000 in the mainland United States. The Corporation will continue to extend PPP loans while the program remains open and is now working on the second part of the process, loan forgiveness, which is expected to be completed predominantly through digital channels. 

&#160; 

During the second quarter, the Corporation&#8217;s revenue streams were also impacted by reduced consumer transaction activity, the waiver of certain late fees and service charges, including ATM transaction fees, as well as the temporary suspension of auto loans and leases, as well as mortgage originations and related securitization and loan sale activities. Collectively, these revenue captions experienced a decrease of approximately $21.9 million when compared to the previous quarter and of approximately $27.2 million when compared to the same quarter of the previous year, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2020, the Corporation reinstated most of the fees waived as a result of the pandemic as well as its normal collection efforts. The speed at which earnings from those activities return to pre-pandemic levels remain highly uncertain and depend on client activity and the economic recovery. 

&#160; 

Mortgage loan origination activity resumed during the month of May. Origination volumes and related mortgage loan securitization activity reflect the impact of the lockdown for a portion of the second quarter of 2020, although the origination volumes for the month of June reflect an increase to a level that is comparable to the same period of the previous year. 

&#160; 

The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition (including our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios), will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position may also affect the ability of the Corporation to continue paying dividends to its shareholders or repurchase shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock, as well as the value of the Corporation&#8217;s goodwill and its deferred tax assets. Refer to Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 

&#160; 

Common Stock Repurchase Plan 

&#160; 

On May 27, 2020, the Corporation completed its previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction (&#8220;ASR&#8221;) for 2020 with respect to its common stock. On March 19, 2020 (the &#8220;early termination date&#8221;), the dealer counterparty to the ASR exercised its right under the ASR agreement to terminate the transaction because the trading price of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock fell below a specified level due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global markets. As a result of such 

&#160; 

early termination, the final settlement of the ASR, which was originally expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2020, occurred during the second quarter of 2020. 

&#160; 

Under the ASR, the Corporation prepaid $500 million and received from the dealer counterparty an initial delivery of 7,055,919 shares of common stock on February 3, 2020. As part of the final settlement of the ASR, the Corporation received an additional 4,763,216 shares of common stock after the early termination date. In total the Corporation repurchased 11,819,135 shares at an average price per share of $42.3043 under the ASR. The Corporation accounted for the ASR as a treasury stock transaction. This transaction increased by $2.20 the Corporation&#8217;s tangible book value per share. 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

Table 1 provides selected financial data and performance indicators for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. 

&#160; 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis &#8211; Non-GAAP Financial Measure 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax, principally in Puerto Rico. The main sources of tax-exempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and sponsored entities, and certain obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and/or its agencies and municipalities and assets held by the Corporation&#8217;s international banking entities. To facilitate the comparison of all interest related to these assets, the interest income has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period. The taxable equivalent computation considers the interest expense and other related expense disallowances required by Puerto Rico tax law. Thereunder, the exempt interest can be deducted up to the amount of taxable income. 

Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is presented with its different components in Tables 2 and 3, along with the reconciliation to net interest income (GAAP), for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared with the same periods in 2019, segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

Financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 

&#61623; For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation recorded net income of $ 127.6 million , compared to net income of $ 171.1 mi llion for the same quarter of the previous year. The results for the second quarter of 2020 reflect lower net interest income by $25.4 million mainly due to the decrease in the Fed Funds rate resulting in lower yields, and the earning asset mix, offset by a decrease in deposit cost, mainly in public sector deposits. The net interest income for the quarter was impacted by the increase in deposits of $9.3 billion, most of which was deployed in overnight Fed Funds or in short-term U.S. Treasury securities and to originate $1.4 billion in Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans under the Payment Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;). These are all lower yielding assets. This change in the composition of our earning assets, coupled with the effect of the declines in market interest rates, resulted in a compression of the Corporation&#8217;s net interest margin to 3.25%, a decrease of 86 basis when compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The provision for credit losses increased by $22.3 million, calculated under the new CECL accounting standard. Non-interest income was lower by $26.3 million mostly due to lower service fees and service charges on deposit accounts due to economic disruptions related to the pandemic, and the waiver of service charges and late fees, in response. Operating expenses were lower by $14.8 million mainly due to lower business promotion expenses, professional fees and personnel costs. 

&#61623; Total assets at June 30, 2020 amounted to $62.8 billion, compared to $52.1 billion, at December 31, 2019. The increase of $10.7 billion was mainly due to higher money market investments, loan balances and higher investments in debt securities available-for-sale. 

&#61623; Total deposits at June 30, 2020 increased by $10.1 billion when compared to deposits at December 31, 2019, mainly due to an 

&#160; 

increase in BPPR public sector deposits, and retail and commercial demand and savings accounts. 

&#61623; Capital ratios continued to be strong. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation&#8217;s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 15.71%, while the total capital ratio was 18.29%. Refer to Table 8 for capital ratios. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Due to the effects of the current and projected interest rate environment and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the valuation of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, the Corporation deemed these factors as a triggering event during the first quarter of 2020 which required management to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. During the second quarter, management continued to monitor changes in circumstances to determine if these changes would more likely than not result in an impairment of goodwill. Based on the analysis performed, no impairment was recognized. Refer to Note - 14 &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#8221; for additional information of the Corporation&#8217;s interim goodwill impairment test. 

Refer to the Operating Results Analysis and Financial Condition Analysis within this MD&#38;A for additional discussion of significant quarterly variances and items impacting the financial performance of the Corporation. 

As a financial services company, the Corporation&#8217;s earnings are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions in the markets which we serve. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by the level of business spending and investment, consumer income, spending and savings, capital market activities, competition, customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products. 

The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations. Also, competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect its profitability. 

The Corporation continuously monitors general business and economic conditions, industry-related indicators and trends, competition, interest rate volatility, credit quality indicators, loan and deposit demand, operational and systems efficiencies, revenue enhancements and changes in the regulation of financial services companies.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 

&#160; 

The accounting and reporting policies followed by the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and general practices within the financial services industry. Various elements of the Corporation&#8217;s accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. 

Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Corporation&#8217;s Audit Committee. The Corporation has identified as critical accounting policies those related to: (i) Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality; (iv) Income Taxes; (v) Goodwill; and (vi) Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations. For a summary of these critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to that particular section in the MD&#38;A included in Popular, Inc.&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K. Also, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2019 Form 10-K for a summary of the Corporation&#8217;s significant accounting policies, including those related to business combinations, and to Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10Q for information on recently adopted accounting standard updates and changes to our significant accounting policies.

OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 

&#160; 

NET INTEREST INCOME 

&#160; 

Net interest income was $450.9 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $25.4 million when compared to $476.3 million for the same quarter of 2019. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $493.0 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $28.5 million when compared to $521.6 million for the same quarter of 2019. 

&#160; 

Net interest margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 3.25%, a decrease of 86 basis points when compared to 4.11% for the same quarter of the previous year. The lower net interest margin for the quarter is mainly as a result of three major factors: the decrease of 225 basis points in the Federal Funds Rate when compared to the same quarter in 2019, the increase in average deposits by $9.3 billion and the deployment of that increase into mostly overnight Fed Funds, short-term U.S. Treasury securities and $1.4 billion ($913 million in average balance) in loans under the SBA PPP. These assets, although accretive to net interest income, are low yielding assets and compressed the net interest margin. The redeployment in relatively short tenured assets respond to the uncertainty of the tenure of the deposit growth. Net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the second quarter of 2020 was 3.56%, a decrease of 94 basis points when compared to 4.50% for the same quarter of 2019.The detailed variances of the decrease in net interest income are described below: 

&#160; 

Negative variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest income from money market investments related to the above-mentioned decrease in the Federal Funds Rate, partially offset by an increase in average volume; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from investment securities due to lower yield, partially offset by higher volume of U.S. Treasuries and agencies related to recent purchases to deploy liquidity and to benefit from the Puerto Rico tax exemption of these assets; and 

&#61623; Lower interest income from loans driven by the waived fees on past due loans associated to the moratorium to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; by the impact of the decrease in rates on variable rate loans and the origination of loans under a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average loans, mainly PPP loans, which carry a yield of approximately 2.85%, including the amortization of fees received under the program. 

&#160; 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on deposits due to lower interest cost resulting from the decrease in interest rates, mostly on Puerto Rico Government and U.S. deposits, partially offset by higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $5.1 billion. The increase in deposit balances experienced in the past three years has been amplified during the quarter by the inflow of deposits from the relief and assistance programs provided by the P.R. and Federal governments in response to the pandemic. 

&#160; 

Interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, included the amortization of deferred loans fees, prepayment penalties, late fees and the amortization of premium/discounts, amounting to $13.1 million or a decrease of $1.4 million when compared to the same quarter in 2019.

Note: The changes that are not due solely to volume or rate are allocated to volume and rate based on the proportion of the change in each category.

&#160; 

Net interest income for the six month period ended June 30, 2020 was $924.0 million, compared to $947.3 million for the same period of 2019. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.0 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $17.6 million when compared to the same period of 2019. Net interest margin was 3.58%, a decrease of 58 basis points when compared to 4.16% for the same period in 2019. The drivers of the decrease in net interest margin are similar to those of the quarter; driven principally by the lower interest rates, the increase in deposit volume and the deployment of those deposits mostly in money market investments, short-term debt securities and in loans, mainly under the PPP. Net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was 3.93%, a decrease of 60 basis points when compared to the 4.53% for the same period of 2019. The drivers of the variances in net interest income for the six-month period are: 

&#160; 

Negative variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest income from money market investments due the cumulative impact of the Federal Reserve interest rate decreases that occurred during 2019 and Q1 2020, partially offset by higher volume; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from investment securities due to lower rates, partially offset by a higher volume of U.S. Treasuries and agencies related to recent purchases to deploy liquidity and to benefit from the Puerto Rico tax exemption of these assets; and, 

&#61623; Lower interest income from loans mainly driven by the waived fees on past due loans associated to the payment moratorium to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of the decrease in rates in variable rate loans, partially offset by higher volume of loans, mainly loans issued under a lower interest rate environment, including PPP loans. 

&#160; 

Positive variances: 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on deposits due to lower interest cost resulting from the decrease in interest rates, mostly on Puerto Rico Government and U.S. deposits, partially offset by higher average balance of interest-bearing deposits. 

&#160; 

Interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 included the amortization of deferred loans fees, prepayment penalties, late fees and the amortization of premium/discounts, amounting to $25.6 million, compared with $30.7 million for the same period in 2019.

Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation&#8217;s provision for credit losses was $63.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $40.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $22.9 million. 

The provision for credit losses for the BPPR segment was $60.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $29.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $31.4 million. The increase was mainly due to the implementation of the CECL model in 2020. The Popular U.S. segment provision for credit losses amounted to $2.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $8.5 million, compared to $11.2 million for the same quarter in 2019. The decrease was due in part to a lower provision for the taxi medallion portfolio. 

The Corporation&#8217;s provision for credit losses was $252.1 million for the six months June 30, 2020, compared to $82.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $170.1 million. 

The provision for credit losses for the BPPR segment was $173.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $60.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, an increase of $113.0 million. The Popular U.S. segment provision for credit losses amounted to $78.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $57.1 million, compared to $21.6 million for the same quarter in 2019. 

The increase in the provision for credit losses for the six month period ended June 30, 2020 when compared to the period of the previous year reflects the impact of the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard, discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Corporation recorded $134 million in incremental reserves resulting from the deterioration in the economic outlook as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management will continue to carefully review the exposure of the portfolios to COVID-19 related risks, as well as changes in the economic outlook and their effect on credit quality. 

Refer to the Credit Risk section of this MD&#38;A for a detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, the allowance for credit losses and selected loan losses statistics. 

&#160; 

Provision for Credit Losses &#8211; Investment Securities 

&#160; 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation recorded a release of $0.7 million on its ACL related to its investment securities portfolio of Obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico, states and political subdivisions. The decrease in the ACL is mainly related to the securities issued by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a government instrumentality, for which the underlying source of payment is second mortgage loans in Puerto Rico residential properties (not the government), but for which HFA, provides a guarantee in the event of default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The ACL for these securities is calculated using BPPR&#8217;s non-default second mortgages expected losses as a proxy, as described in Note 7. During the second quarter of 2020, the FICO scores of this population improved when compared to Q1 2020, which resulted in a lower estimate of expected losses. At June 30, 2020, the total allowance for credit losses for this portfolio amounted to $12.7 million. 

&#160; 

Non-Interest Income 

&#160; 

Non-interest income amounted to $112.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared to $138.3 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The decrease in non-interest income by $26.3 million was primarily driven by: 

&#61623; lower service charges on deposit accounts by $9.5 million, mainly in the BPPR segment, due to lower transactions resulting from business disruptions and the waiver of fees related to the pandemic; 

&#61623; lower other service fees by $21.9 million, mainly in the BPPR segment, due to lower credit and debit card fees by $12.0 million due to lower transactional volumes resulting from business disruptions related to the pandemic, which also resulted in the waiver of service charges and late fees; lower insurance fees by $6.0 million in part due to $3.5 million in contingent commissions received during the second quarter of 2019; and lower other fees by $3.3 million in part due to lower retail auto loan servicing fee income; and 

&#61623; an unfavorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves of $3.0 million mainly due to the release of a $4.4 million reserve established in connection with a 2013 transaction during the second quarter of 2019; 

Partially offset by: 

&#61623; higher income from mortgage banking activities by $5.6 million mainly due to lower unfavorable fair value adjustments on mortgage servicing rights by $9.5 million, partially offset by lower mortgage servicing fees by $2.9 million due to a decrease in collections resulting from the payment moratoriums and higher net losses on derivatives positions by $1.4 million; and 

&#61623; an increase in net unrealized gain on equity securities of $1.9 million mainly related to deferred compensation plans that have an offsetting expense in personnel costs. 

&#160; 

Non-interest income amounted to $238.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, compared to $274.8 million for the same period of the previous year. Non-interest income decreased by $36.1 million primarily driven by: 

&#61623; lower service charges on deposit accounts by $6.5 million due to lower transactions and the waiver of fees as a result of the pandemic; 

&#61623; lower other service fees by $21.5 million mainly due to lower credit and debit card fees by $12.0 million due to lower transactional volumes and waiver of service charges and late charges as a result of the pandemic, lower insurance fees by $5.8 million in part due to $3.5 million in contingent commissions received during the second quarter of 2019, and lower other fees by $4.5 million in part due to lower retail auto loan servicing fee income; and 

&#61623; an unfavorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves on previously sold loans of $7.7 million mainly due to the release of a $4.4 million reserve established in connection with a 2013 transaction during the second quarter of 2019 and higher provision in 2020 related to loans previously sold with credit recourse. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Operating Expenses 

&#160; 

Operating expenses amounted to $348.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $14.8 million when compared with the same quarter of 2019, driven primarily by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower personnel cost by $2.3 million due to due to lower commission, incentive and other bonuses by $6.6 million and lower incentives related to the profit-sharing plan which is tied to the Corporation&#8217;s financial performance by $6.3 million; partially offset by higher salaries by $7.8 million impacted by a higher headcount and annual salary revision, and by higher employee deferred compensation plans expense by $1.6 million, resulting from the unrealized gains in equity securities held by the Corporation, in connection with these plans; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower professional fees by $2.7 million due to lower collections, appraisals and other credit related fees by $1.8 million, due to the suspension of collection efforts as a result of the pandemic relief measures, lower programming, processing and other technology services by $1.6 million mainly due to lower volume of transactions and lower legal fees by $2.3 million; partially offset by higher advisory expenses by $2.9 million; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower business promotions by $6.8 million due to lower advertising expense by $3.9 million and lower consumer reward program expense by $2.0 million; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower OREO expenses by $1.6 million due to the temporary suspension of foreclosure activity as part of the pandemic relief measures; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower other operating expenses by $2.9 million due to lower pension plan cost by $3.3 million due to annual changes in actuarial assumptions. 

&#160; 

These decreases were partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher net occupancy expense by $2.2 million due to lower building rental income and lower parking revenues due to decreased activity as a result of the lockdown related to the pandemic . 

&#160; 

Operating expenses amounted to $720.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, increased by $10.4 million when compared with the same period of 2019, driven primarily by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher net occupancy expenses by $3.8 million due to higher cleaning cost and lower building rental and parking income; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher equipment expenses by $1.4 million due to higher software license cost and maintenance expenses; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other taxes by $2.8 million due to higher municipal license tax from higher revenue; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher professional fees by $10.9 million primarily due to higher advisory expenses by $11.1 million related to Corporate initiatives, higher audit and tax services by $3.4 million mainly related to work on new accounting pronouncements; partially offset by lower legal fees by $2.8 million. 

&#160; 

These increases were partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower business promotions by $7.3 million due to lower advertising expense by $5.5 million and lower consumer reward program expense by $2.1 million; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower OREO expenses by $1.8 million due to the temporary suspension of foreclosure activity as part of the pandemic relief measures.

INCOME TAXES 

For the six-month period ended June 30,2020, the Corporation recorded an income tax expense of $27.7 million with an effective tax rate (&#8220;ETR&#8221;) of 15%, compared to $90.6 million with an ETR of 21% for the same period of 2019. The income tax expense and ETR for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, reflects the impact of lower pre-tax income, resulting primarily from a higher provision for credit losses and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Corporation expects a consolidated ETR for the year 2020 to be within a range of 14% to 17%. This expectation will be impacted by the composition and source of its pre-tax income. 

At June 30, 2020, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset amounting to $0.9 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.5 billion. The deferred tax asset related to the U.S. operations was $0.3 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $0.4 billion. 

Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on the income tax expense and deferred tax asset balances. 

&#160; 

REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments for managerial reporting purposes consist of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and Popular U.S. A Corporate grou p has been defined to support the reportable segments. 

&#160; 

For a description of the Corporation&#8217;s reportable segments, including additional financial information and the underlying management accounting process, refer to Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

The Corporate group reported a net income of $3.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with a net income of $3.3 million for the same quarter of the previous year . For the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, the Corporate group reported a net income of $2.5 million, compared to a net income of $2.0 million for the same period of the previous year. 

&#160; 

Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable segments are discussed below: 

&#160; 

Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 

The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment&#8217;s net income amounted to $107.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, compared with net income of $157.5 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results include the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower net interest income by $24.4 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from investment securities by $35.6 million largely due to lower yields due to the decrease in the Federal Reserve interest rates; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from loans by $21.8 million due to lower yields, principally in the commercial portfolio. 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on deposits by $32.7 million mainly due to a lower cost of public sector deposits. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was 3.38% compared to 4.37% for the same quarter in the previous year. The decrease in net interest margin is driven by a lower yield in earning assets, and earning asset mix, partially offset by a lower cost of public sector deposits. 

&#160; 

&#61623; The total provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2020 was $59.8 million, compared to $28.8 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The increase of $31.0 million was mainly due to the impact of the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and the impact of the pandemic on the economic environment. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Non-interest income was lower by $27.6 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower service charges on deposit accounts by $7.9 million due to lower transaction volumes and fees waived as part of the pandemic relief initiatives; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower other service fees by $21.3 million driven by lower debit and credit card transactions and fees waived as part of the pandemic relief initiatives; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Unfavorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves of $3.0 million mainly due to a higher provision related to loans previously sold with credit recourse. 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher income from mortgage banking activities by $5.2 million mainly due to a lower unfavorable fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower operating expenses by $14.6 million mostly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower personnel cost by $2.5 million due to lower incentive compensation, including the Corporation&#8217;s profit-sharing plan, offset by higher salaries due to higher headcount and salary revisions; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower professional fees by $11.3 million due to lower collection and credit related expenses due to the suspension of collection efforts as a result of the pandemic relief measures and lower programming, processing and other technology services mainly due to lower volume of transactions; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower business promotion expense by $5.8 million due to lower advertising and customer reward program expense. 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other operating expenses by $4.3 million mainly due to higher Corporate expense allocations related to consulting and advisory fees. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower income tax expense by $18.6 million mainly due to lower income before tax. 

&#160; 

The Banco Popular de Puerto Rico reportable segment&#8217;s net income amounted to $186.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, compared with net income of $314.2 million for the same period of the previous year. The principal factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results include the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower net interest income by $22.1 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from investment securities by $44.0 million largely due lower yields due to the decrease in the Federal Reserve interest rates; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest income from loans by $22.1 million due to lower yields, mainly in the commercial portfolio. 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower interest expense on deposits by $43.3 million mainly due to a lower cost of public sector deposits. 

&#160; 

The net interest margin for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 decreased to 3.77% from 4.43% for the same quarter in the previous year, mainly due to lower yields in earning assets, partially offset by a lower cost of public sector deposits. 

&#160; 

&#61623; The total provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $173.4 million, compared to $60.2 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase of $113.2 million was mainly due to the impact of the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Non-interest income was lower by $36.2 million mainly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower service charges on deposit accounts by $4.7 million due to lower transaction volumes and the waiver of fees as part of the pandemic relief initiatives; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower other service fees by $20.8 million driven by lower debit and credit card transactions and the waiver of fees as part of the pandemic relief initiatives; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Unfavorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves of $7.7 million mainly due to a higher provision related to loans previously sold with credit recourse; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower other operating income by $4.2 million mainly due to lower gain on sale of repossessed autos. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher income from mortgage banking activities by $1.7 million mainly due to a lower unfavorable fair value adjustment on mortgage servicing rights. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher operating expenses by $5.5 million mostly due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher occupancy expense by $3.2 million mainly due to lower building rental income and parking revenues due to lower activities as a result of the lockdown related to the pandemic; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other operating expenses by $10.8 million mainly due to higher Corporate expense allocations related to consulting and advisory fees. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Partially offset by: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower professional fees by $4.7 million mainly due to technology related expenses incurred by Popular Auto in 2019 related to the system conversion of the portfolio acquired from Wells Fargo; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower business promotion expense by $5.9 million driven by lower advertising expense and lower customer reward program expense. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower income tax expense by $48.9 million mainly due to lower income before tax. 

&#160; 

Popular U.S. 

For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported a net income of $17.0 million, compared with a net income of $10.9 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Lower provision for credit losses by $8.5 million due in part to lower provision for the taxi medallion portfolio; 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher non-interest income by $0.9 million due to gain on sale of taxi medallion loans by $2.2 million, offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts by $1.5 million due to business disruptions and waived fees as a result of the pandemic; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Income tax unfavorable variance of $3.2 million mainly due to a higher income before tax. 

&#160; 

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, the reportable segment of Popular U.S. reported a net loss of $26.4 million, compared with a net income of $23.1 million for the same quarter of the previous year. The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results included the following: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher provision for credit losses by $57.1 million due to the implementation of CECL and the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher operating expenses by $5.6 million due to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher professional fees by $2.6 million mainly due to approximately $3.0 million in higher consulting and advisory fees; and 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher other operating expenses by $3.9 million due to higher provision for unused commitments. 

&#160; 

&#61623; Income tax favorable variance of $14.0 million mainly due to the loss before tax for the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. 

&#160; 

FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 

Assets 

The Corporation&#8217;s total assets were $62.8 billion at June 30, 2020, compared to $52.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition included in this report for additional information. 

Money market investments, trading and investment securities 

Money market investments totaled $9.6 billion at June 30, 2020, compared to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to an increase in deposits, partially offset by purchases of debt securities available-for-sale and originations of PPP loans. 

&#160; 

Debt securities available-for-sale increased by $3.1 billion to $20.8 billion at June 30, 2020. The increase was mainly due to purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information with respect to the Corporation&#8217;s debt securities available-for-sale. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Loans 

Refer to Table 5 for a breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio, the principal category of earning assets. Also, refer to Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information about the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio composition and loan purchases and sales. 

&#160; 

Loans held-in-portfolio increased by $1.7 billion to $ 29.1 billion at June 30, 2020 mainly driven by growth of commercial loans due to originations of PPP loans at both BPPR and PB and an increase of $0.4 billion in mortgage loans due to an increase in the rebooking of GNMA loans subject to the repurchase option due to an increase in delinquency resulting from the payment moratorium. Loans in our serviced GNMA portfolio benefit from payment forbearance programs but continue to reflect the contractual delinquency until the borrower repays deferred payments or completes a payment deferral modification or other borrower assistance alternative. 

&#160; 

The allowance for credit losses for the loan portfolio increased by $0.4 billion, which includes the impact of the adoption of CECL and reserves resulting from the deterioration in the economic outlook as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to the Credit Quality section of the MD&#38;A for additional information on the Allowance for credit losses for the loan portfolio.

Deposits 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s deposits totaled $53.8 billion at June 30, 2020, compared to $43.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The deposits increase of $10.0 billion was mainly due to an increase at BPPR of public sector deposits by $3.7 billion and retail and commercial demand and savings accounts by $5.7 billion. Public sector deposit balances are expected to decline over the long term. However, the receipt by the P.R. Government of additional COVID-19-related Federal assistance and seasonal tax collections are likely to increase public deposit balances at BPPR in the near term. The rate at which public deposit balances will decline is uncertain and difficult to predict. The amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by, for example, the timeline of current debt restructuring efforts under Title III of PROMESA and the speed at which CARES Act assistance is distributed. Refer to Table 7 for a breakdown of the Corporation&#8217;s deposits at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Borrowings 

The Corporation&#8217;s borrowings remained relatively flat at $1.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 16 to the C onsolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings. Also, refer to the Liquidity section in this MD&#38;A for additional information on the Corporation&#8217;s funding sources. 

&#160; 

Other liabilities 

The Corporation&#8217;s other liabilities increased by $0.8 billion to $1.9 billion at June 30, 2020, when compared to December 31, 2019, mainly due to an increase in the liability for GNMA loans sold with a repurchase option of $0.4 billion, as discussed above, and $0.5 billion in unsettled purchases of debt securities . 

&#160; 

Stockholders&#8217; Equity 

&#160; 

Stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $5.8 billion at June 30, 2020, a decrease of $236.6 million, principally due to the impact of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction, the cumulative effect of $205.8 million related to the adoption of CECL, declared dividends of $69.2 million on common stock, and $1.0 million in dividends on preferred stock, partially offset by the net income for 

&#160; 

the six months ended June 30, 2020 of $161.9 million and an increase of unrealized gains on debt securities available-for-sale by $396.9 million. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, Comprehensive Income and of Changes in Stockholders&#8217; Equity for information on the composition of stockholders&#8217; equity.

The Basel III capital rules provide that a depository institution will be deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based ratio of at least 10%. Management has determined that as of June 30, 2020, the Corporation, BPPR and PB continue to exceed the minimum requirements for being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; under the Basel III capital rules. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation elected to use the five-year transition period option as provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective March 31, 2020. The five-year transition period provision delays for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. 

&#160; 

On April 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the final rule issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 that simplified several requirements in the agencies' regulatory capital rules. These rules simplified the regulatory capital requirement for mortgage servicing assets (MSAs), deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions by raising the CET1 deduction threshold from 10% to 25%. The 15% CET 1 deduction threshold which applies to aggregate amount of such items was eliminated. The rule also requires, among other changes, increasing from 100% to 250% the risk weight to MSAs and temporary difference deferred tax asset not deducted from capital. For investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, the risk weight would be based on the exposure category of the investment. As a result of these rules, the Corporation&#8217;s CET1 decreased by 49 bps. 

&#160; 

The decrease in the common equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio, total capital ratio, and leverage capital ratio as of June 30, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019 was mainly attributed to the accelerated share repurchase transaction of $500 million completed in the first quarter of 2020, and to the increase in risk weight assets driven by the increase from 100% to 250% to the risk weight assets of MSAs and temporary difference deferred tax asset not deducted from capital, resulting from the adoption of the aforementioned final rule. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Non-GAAP financial measures 

The tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio, tangible assets and tangible book value per common share, which are presented in the table that follows, are non-GAAP measures. Management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method for mergers and acquisitions. Neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders' equity, total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common equity, tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a provider of financial services, the Corporation routinely enters into commitments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers. These commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit. These commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for on-balance sheet instruments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial position. Other types of off-balance sheet arrangements that the Corporation enters in the ordinary course of business include derivatives and provision of guarantees, indemnifications, and representation and warranties. Refer to Note 20 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion related to the Corporation&#8217;s obligations under credit recourse and representation and warranties arrangements. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 

The Corporation has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commercial commitments, which require future cash payments on debt agreements. 

As previously indicated, the Corporation also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required either to receive or pay cash, depending on changes in interest rates. These contracts are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts and payments based on market rates of interest as of the statement of condition date. The fair value of the contract changes daily as interest rates change. The Corporation may also be required to post additional collateral on margin calls on the derivatives and repurchase transactions. 

Refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of long-term borrowings by maturity. 

The Corporation utilizes lending-related financial instruments in the normal course of business to accommodate the financial needs of its customers. The Corporation&#8217;s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. The Corporation uses credit procedures and policies in making those commitments and conditional obligations as it does in extending loans to customers. Since many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring, the total contractual amounts are not representative of the Corporation&#8217;s actual future credit exposure or liquidity requirements for these commitments. 

Table 10 presents the contractual amounts related to the Corporation&#8217;s off-balance sheet lending and other activities at June 30, 2020.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

Market / Interest Rate Risk 

The financial results and capital levels of the Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest rate and liquidity risks. 

Market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the Corporation&#8217;s capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets and/or liabilities. 

Most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for further information on the debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale amounted to $20.8 billion as of June 30, 2020. Other assets subject to market risk include loans held-for-sale, which amounted to $69 million, mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) which amounted to $141 million and securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221;, which amounted to $34 million, as of June 30, 2020. 

Interest Rate Risk (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) 

The Corporation&#8217;s net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk, including repricing, basis, yield curve and option risks. In managing interest rate risk, management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. 

Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts, management objectives, market expectations and policy constraints. 

Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest Income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and Economic Value of Equity (&#8220;EVE&#8221;). The three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the Corporation&#8217;s IRR. NII simulation modeling is prepared for a five-year period, which in conjunction with the EVE analysis, provides management a better view of long-term IRR. 

Net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the Corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs. 

Management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various NII simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes, the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve. For example, the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates, implied forwards, and parallel and non-parallel rate shocks. Management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures. 

The asset and liability management group perform validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis. In addition, the model and processes used to assess IRR are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the Model Governance and Validation policy. 

The Corporation processes NII simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same amount (parallel shifts). The rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of -100, -200, +100, +200 and +400 basis points during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses are based on many assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes, interest rate spreads, loan prepayments and deposit elasticity. Thus, they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates. By their nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future. The following table presents the results of the simulations at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a one-year time horizon:

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2020, NII simulations show the Corporation maintains an asset sensitive position and is expected to benefit from an overall rising rate environment. The changes in sensitivity for the period are primarily driven by large deposit increases of over $10 billion along with reductions in the rates paid for deposit products. Overall, rates are now considered to be close to their &#8220;lower bound&#8221; because we currently assume, in our interest risk models, that rates will not reach negative values. This has the effect of reducing sensitivity in most products given that rates are close to zero in most curve tenors and therefore have little room to fall further in the declining rates scenarios. However, the Corporation&#8217;s U.S. operations are expected to benefit from modeled additional decreases in rates as the bank could potentially lower its cost of funds while existing contractual interest rate floors in the loan portfolio contribute to NII improvement. We would expect this &#8220;flooring&#8221; effect on sensitivity to declining rates to reverse itself if rates were to rise, because it would mean that rates would once again have more room to fall. In contrast, the sensitivity to rising rate scenarios notably increased as most of the increase in deposits remained in short-term assets and cash at the close of the quarter. 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk, which results from the ability of a third-party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity. Prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten (or lower prepayments could extend) the weighted average life of these portfolios. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Trading 

The Corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries, BPPR and Popular Securities. Popular Securities&#8217; trading activities consist primarily of market-making activities to meet expected customers&#8217; needs related to its retail brokerage business, and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected short-term price movements. BPPR&#8217;s trading activities consist primarily of holding U.S. Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities classified as &#8220;trading&#8221; and hedging the related market risk with &#8220;TBA&#8221; (to-be-announced) market transactions. The objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from short-term market movements. In addition, BPPR uses forward contracts or TBAs to hedge its securitization pipeline. Risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with TBAs that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline. 

At June 30, 2020, the Corporation held trading securities with a fair value of $34 million, representing approximately 0.1% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets, compared with $40 million and 0.1%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. As shown in Table 12, the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgage-backed securities which at June 30, 2020 were investment grade securities. As of June 30, 2020, the trading portfolio also included $0.1 million in Puerto Rico government obligations ($0.6 million as of December 31, 2019). Trading instruments are recognized at fair value, with changes resulting from fluctuations in market prices, interest rates or exchange rates reported in current period earnings. The Corporation recognized a net trading account gain of $ 82 thousand for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and a net trading account gain of $422 thousand for the quarter ended June 30, 2019.

The Corporation&#8217;s trading activities are limited by internal policies. For each of the two subsidiaries, the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5-day net value-at-risk (&#8220;VAR&#8221;), with a confidence level of 99%. The VAR measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5-day holding period, given a 99% probability. 

The Corporation&#8217;s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately $0.5 million for the last week in June 2020. There are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with VAR modeling, and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates. Backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses, in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy. 

In the opinion of management, the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the Corporation. 

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The Corporation currently measures at fair value on a recurring basis its trading debt securities, debt securities available-for-sale, certain equity securities, derivatives and mortgage servicing rights. Occasionally, the Corporation may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, loans held-in-portfolio that are collateral dependent and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

The Corporation categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value under the three-level hierarchy. The level within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for fair value measurement are observable. 

Refer to Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Corporation&#8217;s fair value measurement required by the applicable accounting standard. 

A description of the Corporation&#8217;s valuation methodologies used for the assets and liabilities measured at fair value is included in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2019 Form 10-K. Also, refer to the Critical Accounting Policies / Estimates in the 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the accounting guidance and the Corporation&#8217;s policies or procedures related to fair value measurements. 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

The objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the Corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations, finance expected future growth, fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the Corporation&#8217;s tolerance for liquidity risk, including approving relevant risk limits and policies. The Board of Directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the Risk Management Committee and the Asset/Liability Management Committee. The management of liquidity risk, on a long-term and day-to-day basis, is the responsibility of the Corporate Treasury Division. The Corporation&#8217;s Corporate Treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors and for monitoring the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position on an ongoing basis. Also, the Corporate Treasury Division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments, oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process. The Financial and Operational Risk Management Division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies. 

An institution&#8217;s liquidity may be pressured if, for example, it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, its credit rating is downgraded, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution. Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook, adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. 

Liquidity is managed by the Corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. It is also managed at the level of the banking and non-banking subsidiaries. As further explained below, a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies (the &#8220;BHCs&#8221;) are dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries. The Corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries. Additionally, contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur. However, such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event, and are dependent on many assumptions. 

Deposits, including customer deposits, brokered deposits and public funds deposits, continue to be the most significant source of funds for the Corporation, funding 86% of the Corporation&#8217;s total assets at June 30, 2020 and 84% at December 31, 2019. The ratio of total ending loans to deposits was 54% at June 30, 2020, compared to 63% at December 31, 2019. In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.3 billion at June 30, 2020 (December 31, 2019 - $1.3 billion) . A detailed description of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowings, including their terms, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements provide information on the Corporation&#8217;s cash inflows and outflows. 

As previously mentioned, during 2020 the Corporation executed actions corresponding to its capital and liquidity strategic plans. These included the $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction with respect to its common stock and an increase in quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share. Refer to additional details of these transactions in the Overview section of this MD&#38;A and Notes 18 - Stockholders Equity and Note 26 - Net Income Per Common Share. 

The following sections provide further information on the Corporation&#8217;s major funding activities and needs, as well as the risks involved in these activities. Note 34 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides consolidating statements of condition, of operations and of cash flows which separately presents the Corporation&#8217;s bank holding companies and its subsidiaries as part of the &#8220;All other subsidiaries and eliminations&#8221; column. 

Banking Subsidiaries 

Primary sources of funding for the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries (BPPR and PB or &#8220;the banking subsidiaries&#8221;) include retail, commercial and public sector deposits, brokered deposits, unpledged investment securities, mortgage loan securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities. 

Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information of the Corporation&#8217;s borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries. 

The principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations, investment portfolio purchases, loan purchases and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 

&#160; 

expenses. Also, the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments, recourse provisions, servicing advances, derivatives, credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by BPPR. 

The banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows. The Corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

The Corporation&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various factors, including pricing, service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results, credit ratings (by nationally recognized credit rating agencies), and importantly, FDIC deposit insurance. Although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits, management does not believe that the impact should be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured (subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings. 

Deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates. Refer to Table 7 for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and public sector customers. Core deposits include all non-interest bearing deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit under $100,000, excluding brokered deposits with denominations under $100,000. Core deposits have historically provided the Corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. Core deposits totaled $ 48.2 billion, or 90% of total deposits, at June 30, 2020 , compared with $38.8 billion, or 89% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019 . Core deposits financed 81% of the Corporation&#8217;s earning assets at June 30, 2020, compared with 80% at December 31, 2019 . 

The distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of $100,000 and over at June 30, 2020 is presented in the table that follows:

The Corporation had $ 0.7 billion in brokered deposits at June 30, 2020 , which financed approximately 1% of its total assets (December 31, 2019 - $0.5 billion and 1%, respectively) . In the event that any of the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries&#8217; regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a well-capitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators, that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits, which may hinder the Corporation&#8217;s ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts. 

Deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the Company. As of June 30, 2020, total public sector deposits were $14.3 billion. Generally, these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral; therefore liquidity risks arising from deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return. However, there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow happens and when the bank receives its collateral. This, now unpledged, collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash. 

At June 30, 2020 , management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations, as well as special needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event. Although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate. The Corporation&#8217;s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if its banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not 

&#160; 

available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates. The banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements. To the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes, the Corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements, thereby adversely affecting its liquidity. Finally, if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected. 

Bank Holding Companies 

The principal sources of funding for the BHCs, which are Popular, Inc. (holding company only) and PNA, include cash on hand, investment securities, dividends received from banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales, credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings. Dividends from banking and non-banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the BHCs. 

The principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt, and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest (related to trust preferred securities), the payment of dividends to common stock holders and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries. 

The BHCs have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their non-banking subsidiaries, however, the cash needs of the Corporation&#8217;s non-banking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal. These sources of funding have become more costly due to the Corporation&#8217;s below &#8220;investment grade&#8221; credit ratings. The Corporation&#8217;s principal credit ratings are below &#8220;investment grade&#8221;, which affects the Corporation&#8217;s ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits the Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. 

The outstanding balance of notes payable at the BHCs amounted to $681 million at June 30, 2020 and $680 million at December 31, 2019 . 

The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable at June 30, 2020 are presented in Table 14.

Annual debt service at the BHCs is approximately $44 million per annum, and the Company&#8217;s latest quarterly dividend was $0.40 per share. The BHCs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand, investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all BHCs obligations during the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2020, the BHCs had cash and money markets investments totaling $258 million, borrowing potential of $149 million from its secured facility with BPPR. In addition to these liquidity sources, the stake in EVERTEC had a market value of $327 million as of June 30, 2020, and it represents an additional source of contingent liquidity. 

Non-banking subsidiaries 

The principal sources of funding for the non-banking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations, loan sales, repurchase agreements, capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies. The principal uses of funds for the non-banking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, operational expenses and payment of dividends to the BHCs. The liquidity needs of the non-banking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies. 

Dividends 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Corporation declared quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock of $0.40 per share, for a year-to-date total of $ 69.2 million. The dividends for the Corporation&#8217;s Series A and Series B preferred stock 

&#160; 

amounted to $1.1 million. On February 24, 2020, the Corporation redeemed all the outstanding shares of 2008 Series B Preferred Stock. Refer to Note 18 for additional information. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the BHC&#8217;s received dividends amounting to $578 million from BPPR, $4 million in dividends from its non-banking subsidiaries and $1 million in dividends from EVERTEC&#8217;s parent company. Dividends from BPPR constitute Popular, Inc.&#8217;s primary source of liquidity. 

Other Funding Sources and Capital 

The debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity, which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements. The Corporation&#8217;s debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid U.S. government debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency debt securities, U.S. government sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets. The availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated, in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties. The Corporation&#8217;s unpledged debt securities amounted to $4.5 billion at June 30, 2020 and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2019. A substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the U.S. money markets or from secured lending sources. 

Additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities, prepayments and sales. The loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets. In particular, mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans, have secondary markets which the Corporation could use. 

Risks to Liquidity 

Total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis. Some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements, standards of creditworthiness, leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements, among other factors. Derivatives, such as those embedded in long-term repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps, and off-balance sheet exposures, such as recourse, performance bonds or credit card arrangements, are subject to collateral requirements. As their fair value increases, the collateral requirements may increase, thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities. 

The importance of the Puerto Rico market for the Corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities. In the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in Puerto Rico, the credit quality of the Corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs. The Puerto Rico economy continues to face various challenges, including significant pressures in some sectors of the residential real estate market. Refer to the Geographic and Government Risk section of this MD&#38;A for some highlights on the current status of the Puerto Rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 

Factors that the Corporation does not control, such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes, could also affect its ability to obtain funding. In order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario, management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable. These plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms, such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the FHLB and the FRB. 

The credit ratings of Popular&#8217;s debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the Corporation&#8217;s ability to borrow in the capital markets, its cost and access to funding sources. Credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management, geographic concentration in Puerto Rico, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the Corporation&#8217;s ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources, among other factors. 

Furthermore, various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, PB may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or the NYSDFS. The ability of a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to its BHC could thus be impacted by its financial performance, thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the BHCs from the banking subsidiaries. This could, in turn, affect the BHCs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock, for example. Popular, Inc. received $578 million in dividends from BPPR during the six months ended June 30, 

&#160; 

2020 and its ability to continue receiving dividends from BPPR will depend on such banking subsidiary&#8217;s financial condition and results of operation. 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations, and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the Corporation&#8217;s overall credit ratings. 

Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 

The Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had $9 million in deposits at June 30, 2020 that are subject to rating triggers. 

In addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, as discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution&#8217;s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $58 million at June 30, 2020. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results.

&#160; 

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the &#8220;Commonwealth&#8221; or &#8220;Puerto Rico&#8221;), which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges. 

&#160; 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

&#160; 

On December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally to other countries and jurisdictions, including the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels worldwide, including in the markets in which we do business. In Puerto Rico, the Governor issued an executive order on March 15, 2020 declaring a health emergency, ordering residents to shelter in place, implementing a mandatory curfew, and requiring the closure of all businesses, except for businesses that provide essential services, including banking and financial institutions with respect to certain services. While many of the restrictions have been gradually lifted, a mandatory curfew is still in effect and certain establishments deemed non-essential, including movie theaters, gyms and bars, remain closed. Moreover, most businesses that are allowed to operate have had to make significant adjustments to protect customers and employees, including transitioning to telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in compliance with health and safety guidelines. 

&#160; 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on economic activity in Puerto Rico in the medium- and long-term will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and of the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the same. However, at least in the short-term, the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments in response to the same have had a material adverse effect on economic activity worldwide, including in Puerto Rico, and there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact. 

&#160; 

In response to the pandemic, on April 2020 the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly enacted legislation requiring financial institutions to offer through June 2020 moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of mortgage loans, the moratorium period was extended through August 2020. These moratoriums could, among other things, limit our ability to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that have benefited from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments. Additionally, the Federal Government has also approved several economic stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic, including guaranteeing through the Small Business Administration&#8217;s Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;) loans to small and medium businesses. 

&#160; 

For a discussion of the impact of the pandemic on the Corporation&#8217;s operations and financial results during the second quarter of 2020, refer to the MD&#38;A Significant Events section, on the accompanying financial statements. For additional discussion of risk factors related to the impact of the pandemic, see &#8220;Part II &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors&#8221; in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and in our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. For information regarding the projections of the 2020 Fiscal Plan (defined below) with respect to the impact of the pandemic, see Fiscal Plans, Commonwealth Fiscal Plan , below. 

&#160; 

Economic Performance 

&#160; 

The Commonwealth&#8217;s economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (&#8220;GNP&#8221;) has contracted (in real terms) every fiscal year between 2007 and 2018, with the exception of fiscal year 2012. Pursuant to the latest Puerto Rico Planning Board (the &#8220;Planning Board&#8221;) estimates, published in July 2019, the Commonwealth&#8217;s real GNP for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 decreased by 3% and 4.7%, respectively. The Planning Board&#8217;s report also projected an increase in real GNP of 

&#160; 

approximately 2% and 3.6% in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, in part due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Mar&#237;a. The Planning Board&#8217;s projections for fiscal year 2020, however, do not account for the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or the recent seismic activity, discussed below, on the Commonwealth&#8217;s economy. The 2020 Fiscal Plan, which considers the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent seismic activity, estimates that the Puerto Rico economy will contract 4% in real terms in fiscal year 2020, largely due to the pandemic, with a limited recovery of 0.5% in fiscal year 2021. For information regarding the economic projections of the 2020 Fiscal Plan (defined below), see Fiscal Plans, Commonwealth Fiscal Plan , below. 

&#160; 

Fiscal Crisis 

The Commonwealth remains in the midst of a profound fiscal crisis affecting the central government and many of its instrumentalities, public corporations and municipalities. This fiscal crisis has been primarily the result of economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy obligations, and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. As a result of the crisis, the Commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities have been unable to make debt service payments on their outstanding bonds and notes since 2016. The escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the U.S. Congress to enact the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (&#8220;PROMESA&#8221;) in June 2016. The Commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities are currently in the process of restructuring their debts through the debt restructuring mechanisms provided by PROMESA. 

Recent Seismic Activity 

&#160; 

On January 7, 2020, Puerto Rico was struck by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake, which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. The 6.4 earthquake was preceded by foreshocks and followed by aftershocks. The Commonwealth&#8217;s government estimates total earthquake-related damages at approximately $1 billion. 

&#160; 

PROMESA 

&#160; 

PROMESA, among other things, created a seven-member federally-appointed oversight board (the &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221;) with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the Commonwealth, its public corporations, instrumentalities and municipalities and established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of such entities. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets, in accordance with modified accrual accounting, are produced for at least four consecutive years. In August 2016, President Obama appointed the seven voting members of the Oversight Board through the process established in PROMESA, which authorizes the President to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders and which process was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. The terms of the original Oversight Board members expired on August 2019, but PROMESA allows them to remain in their roles until their successors have been appointed. However, some of the members of the Oversight Board, including its chairman, have recently announced that they will be resigning from their positions effective this year. Any new members would need to be appointed by the U.S. President through the process established in PROMESA. 

&#160; 

In October 2016, the Oversight Board designated the Commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities as &#8220;covered entities&#8221; under PROMESA. The only Commonwealth government entities that were not subject to such initial designation were the Commonwealth&#8217;s municipalities. In May 2019, however, the Oversight Board designated all of the Commonwealth&#8217;s municipalities as covered entities. At the Oversight Board&#8217;s request, covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the Oversight Board for its review and approval. They are also required to seek Oversight Board approval to issue, guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of $10 million or more. Finally, covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by PROMESA. 

&#160; 

Fiscal Plans 

&#160; 

Commonwealth Fiscal Plan . The Oversight Board has certified several fiscal plans for the Commonwealth since 2017. The most recent fiscal plan for the Commonwealth certified by the Oversight Board is dated May 27, 2020 (the &#8220;2020 Fiscal Plan&#8221;). As mentioned above, the 2020 Fiscal Plan estimates that the economy of Puerto Rico will contract by 4% in real terms in fiscal year 

&#160; 

2020, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a limited recovery of 0.5% in fiscal year 2021. This new economic outlook exacerbates the Commonwealth government&#8217;s fiscal challenges. As a result of these changes, the 2020 Fiscal Plan projects that the Commonwealth will have a pre-contractual debt service deficit each year through 2025 if the measures and structural reforms contemplated by the plan are not successfully implemented. It estimates that the proposed fiscal measures and structural reforms will drive approximately $10 billion in savings and extra revenue through 2025 and a cumulative 0.88% increase in growth by fiscal year 2049. However, even after the fiscal measures and structural reforms, and before contractual debt service, the 2020 Fiscal Plan&#8217;s projections reflect an annual deficit starting in fiscal year 2032. 

The 2020 Fiscal Plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of Commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. Since fiscal year 2017, Commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have been reduced by approximately 64% (from approximately $370 million in fiscal year 2017 to approximately $132 million in fiscal year 2020). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the 2020 Fiscal Plan provided for a one-year pause on reductions to appropriations to municipalities. Accordingly, appropriations to municipalities for fiscal year 2021 remained at $132 million, rather than declining by $44 million as contemplated by the prior fiscal plan. In addition, the Governor signed an executive order that adopts the &#8220;Strategic Plan for Disbursement&#8221; of the $2.2 billion allocated to Puerto Rico by the Coronavirus Relief Fund created by the Federal Government through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Such plan assigns $100 million to municipalities for eligible expenses related to COVID-19. The 2020 Fiscal Plan contemplates additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities starting in fiscal year 2022, before eventually phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year 2025. The 2020 Fiscal Plan notes that municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on Commonwealth appropriations and better address the impact of declining populations and that, as currently operating, many municipalities are not fiscally sustainable. 

&#160; 

Other Fiscal Plans. Pursuant to PROMESA, the Oversight Board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities. The certified fiscal plan for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (&#8220;PREPA&#8221;), Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric power utility, contemplated the transformation of Puerto Rico&#8217;s electric system through, among other things, the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to PREPA&#8217;s transmission and distribution system, and calls for significant structural reforms at PREPA. The procurement process for the establishment of a public-private partnership with respect to PREPA&#8217;s transmission and distribution system (the &#8220;T&#38;D System&#8221;) was completed in June 2020. The selected proponent, LUMA Energy LLC (&#8220;LUMA&#8221;), and PREPA entered into a 15-year agreement whereby LUMA will be responsible for operating, maintaining and modernizing the T&#38;D System. 

&#160; 

On June 26, 2020, the Oversight Board certified a fiscal plan (the &#8220;CRIM Fiscal Plan&#8221;) for the Municipal Revenue Collection Center, the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities. The CRIM Fiscal Plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of Puerto Rico&#8217;s property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections, including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties, and implementing operational and technological initiatives. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Pending Title III Proceedings 

&#160; 

On May 3, 2017, the Oversight Board, on behalf of the Commonwealth, filed a petition in the U.S. District Court to restructure the Commonwealth&#8217;s liabilities under Title III of PROMESA. The Oversight Board has subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (&#8220;COFINA&#8221;), the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (&#8220;ERS&#8221;), the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, PREPA and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (&#8220;PBA&#8221;). On February 12, 2019, the government completed a restructuring of COFINA&#8217;s debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the U.S. District Court. On September 27, 2019, the Oversight Board filed a plan of adjustment for the Commonwealth, ERS and PBA in the pending debt restructuring proceedings under Title III of PROMESA. On February 9, 2020, the Oversight Board announced that it had reached a new agreement with certain bondholders on a new framework for a plan of adjustment and, on February 28, 2020, the Oversight Board filed an amended plan of adjustment reflecting such new agreement. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the Oversight Board requested that the court adjourn court proceedings related to the Proposed Plan of Adjustment so as to allow for the Government and the Oversight Board to prioritize the health and safety of the people of Puerto Rico and to gain a better understanding of the economic and fiscal impact of the pandemic. 

&#160; 

PROMESA Adversary Proceeding 

&#160; 

In 2019, the Oversight Board commenced an adversary proceeding against the Commonwealth seeking to invalidate Act 29-2019 (&#8220;Act 29&#8221;), which eliminated the obligation of municipalities to contribute to the Commonwealth&#8217;s health plan and pay-as-you-go retirement system, on the grounds that Act 29 was inconsistent with the 2019 Fiscal Plan. On April 15, 2020, the Judge ruled in favor of the Oversight Board and declared Act 29 &#8220;unenforceable and of no effect.&#8221; Judge Swain delayed the effective date of the opinion and order for three weeks, through May 6, 2020, to provide time for the Government and the Oversight Board to agree on a mechanism for the reimbursement to the Commonwealth of approximately $166 million and $32 million, respectively, on account of retirement and health plan obligations due by municipalities as a result of the invalidation of Act 29. Subsequent to the Court&#8217;s decision, the Oversight Board, the Government and the Municipal Revenue Collection Center (&#8220;CRIM&#8221;), which is the entity primarily responsible for the collection of property taxes for the municipalities, made various proposals to resolve the immediate fiscal impact of Act 29&#8217;s invalidation. On May 6, 2020, the Government filed a motion informing the Court that CRIM had agreed to accept a proposal by the Oversight Board to reverse a $132 million transfer from the Commonwealth to the municipalities in the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal year 2020 budget (to be allocated among municipalities) to offset the approximately $198 million obligation of municipalities for the health plan and pay-as-you go retirement system payments for fiscal year 2020. The remaining $66 million would have to be repaid by municipalities by the end of fiscal year 2022 from other sources of revenue. There continue to be differences between the Government and the Oversight Board as to the calculation of the municipalities obligation for the health plan and retirement system payments, as well as to long-term solutions to the fiscal consequences to the municipalities of Act 29&#8217;s invalidation. The effect of the court&#8217;s decision and the implementation of the offset proposal described above on municipal finances is likely to vary significantly across municipalities. 

&#160; 

Exposure of the Corporation 

&#160; 

The credit quality of BPPR&#8217;s loan portfolio reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession have been reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. While PROMESA provides a process to address the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal crisis, the length and complexity of the Title III proceedings for the Commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans present significant economic risks. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected many of our individual customers and customers&#8217; businesses. This, when added to Puerto Rico&#8217;s ongoing fiscal crisis and recession, could cause credit losses that adversely affect us and may negatively affect consumer confidence, result in reductions in consumer spending, and adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues. If global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board are unable to adequately manage the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic challenges, including by controlling the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and consummating an orderly restructuring of the Commonwealth&#8217;s debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities totaled $429 million and $432 million, respectively, which amounts were fully outstanding on such dates. On July 1, 2020 the Corporation received principal payments amounting to $58 million from various obligations from Puerto Rico 

&#160; 

municipalities. Further deterioration of the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us. Of the amount outstanding, $391 million consists of loans and $38 million are securities ($391 million and $41 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019). Substantially all of the amount outstanding at June 30, 2020 were obligations from various Puerto Rico municipalities. In most cases, these were &#8220;general obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or &#8220;special obligations&#8221; of a municipality, to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. At June 30, 2020, 75% of the Corporation&#8217;s exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of San Juan, Guaynabo, Carolina and Bayam&#243;n (amount was reduced to 74% after reflecting payments received on July 1, 2020). For additional discussion of the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities, refer to Note 21 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies. 

&#160; 

In addition, at June 30, 2020, the Corporation had $336 million in loans insured or securities issued by Puerto Rico governmental entities, but for which the principal source of repayment is non-governmental ($350 million at December 31, 2019). These included $270 million in residential mortgage loans insured by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#8220;HFA&#8221;), a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA (December 31, 2019 - $276 million). These mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on Puerto Rico residential properties and the HFA insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The Corporation also had, at June 30, 2020, $46 million in bonds issued by HFA which are secured by second mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, and for which HFA also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions (December 31, 2019 - $46 million). In the event that the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of this loans, HFA&#8217;s ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA at the time such obligations become due and payable. Although the Governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, she has not exercised this power as of the date hereof. In addition, at June 30, 2020, the Corporation had $20 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by non-governmental parties (December 31, 2019 - $21 million). On January 1, 2020, the Corporation received a payment amounting to $7 million upon the maturity of securities issued by HFA which had been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of U.S. agencies and Treasury obligations had been escrowed (December 31, 2019 - $7 million). 

&#160; 

BPPR&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers, lessors, suppliers or have other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the Commonwealth&#8217;s fiscal crisis and the ongoing Title III proceedings under PROMESA described above. Similarly, BPPR&#8217;s mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to current and former government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits. 

&#160; 

BPPR also has a significant amount of deposits from the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities, and municipalities. The amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities, as well as on the ability of BPPR to maintain these customer relationships. 

&#160; 

The Corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the Oversight Board on behalf of the Commonwealth or other Title III debtors. For additional information regarding such exposure, refer to Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

United States Virgin Islands 

&#160; 

The Corporation has operations in the United States Virgin Islands (the &#8220;USVI&#8221;) and has credit exposure to USVI government entities. 

&#160; 

The USVI has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI and, as such, there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the USVI and its public corporations and instrumentalities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To the extent that the fiscal condition of the USVI continues to deteriorate, the U.S. Congress or the Government of the USVI may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable to the USVI. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2020, the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to USVI instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately $69 million, of which $68 million is outstanding (compared to $71 million and $67 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019). Of the amount outstanding, approximately (i) $42 million represents loans to the West Indian Company LTD, a government-owned company that owns and operates a cruise ship pier and shopping mall complex in St. Thomas, (ii) $20 million represents loans to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority, a public corporation of the USVI that operates USVI&#8217;s water production and electric generation plants, and (iii) $6 million represents loans to the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, a public corporation of the USVI created for the purpose of raising capital for public projects (compared to $42 million, $17 million and $8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019). 

&#160; 

U.S. Government 

&#160; 

As further detailed in Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the Corporation&#8217;s investment securities represented exposure to the U.S. Government in the form of U.S. Government sponsored entities, as well as agency mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $1.5 billion of residential mortgages and $64 million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies at June 30, 2020 (compared to $1.1 billion and $66 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019). 

&#160; 

Non-Performing Assets 

Non-performing assets include primarily past-due loans that are no longer accruing interest, renegotiated loans, and real estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit quality metrics, is presented in Table 15. 

The Corporation adopted the CECL accounting standard effective January 1, 2020. This framework requires management to estimate credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the loan using economic forecasts over a reasonable and supportable period, and historical information thereafter. 

The Corporation exhibited stable credit quality metrics in the second quarter of 2020 as Popular continued to provide financial relief to customers impacted by the pandemic. The effect of the pandemic and the full extent of its economic disruption remains uncertain. Management believes that the improvement over the last few years in the risk profile of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolios better positions Popular to operate successfully under the ongoing challenging environment. Management will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to COVID-19 pandemic related risks, changes in the economic outlook of the regions in which we operate and how delinquencies and NCOs evolve after the period of payment deferrals lapses during the third quarter of 2020. 

At June 30, 2020, total non-performing assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;) increased by $231 million when compared with December 31, 2019. Total non-performing loans held-in-portfolio increased by $232 million from December 31, 2019, impacted by the adoption of the CECL methodology during the first quarter of 2020. Following existing accounting guidance, purchased credit impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8217;) loans were excluded from non-performing status due to the estimation of cash flows at the pool level. Under CECL, these loans are accounted for on an individual loan basis under PCD accounting methodology and are no longer excluded from non-performing status. BPPR&#8217;s NPLs increased by $227 million, mostly related to the PCI loans transition impact of $260 million. Excluding this impact, NPLs decreased by $28 million, mostly related to lower mortgage NPLs. Popular Bank&#8217;s NPLs increased by $5 million, also driven by the PCI transition of the taxi medallion portfolio. At June 30, 2020, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held-in-portfolio was 2.6% compared to 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, non-performing loans-held-for-sale (&#8220;LHFS&#8217;) increased by $7 million driven by taxi medallion loans, and other real estate owned loans (&#8220;OREOs&#8221;) decreased by $8 million, mostly due to the suspension of foreclosure activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

At June 30, 2020, NPLs secured by real estate amounted to $638 million in the Puerto Rico operations and $27 million in the Popular U.S. operations. These figures were $406 million and $26 million, respectively, at December 31, 2019. 

The Corporation&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;) amounted to $7.8 billion at June 30, 2020, of which $2.0 billion was secured with owner occupied properties, compared with $7.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. CRE NPLs amounted to $214 million at June 30, 2020, compared with $113 million at December 31, 2019. The CRE NPL ratios for the BPPR and Popular U.S. segments were 5.41% and 0.07%, respectively, at June 30, 2020, compared with 2.88% and 0.07%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. 

In addition to the NPLs included in Table 15, at June 30, 2020, there were $232 million of performing loans, mostly commercial loans, which in management&#8217;s opinion, are currently subject to potential future classification as non-performing (December 31, 2019 - $207 million). 

Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio, excluding consumer loans, increased by $47.7 million, when compared to the inflows for the same quarter in 2019, primarily driven by higher inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the BPPR segment. The BPPR mortgage inflows increased by $32.4 million from the same quarter in 2019, mainly related to PCD loans which previous to the CECL adoption were not classified as NPLs. The U.S. inflows increased by $3.4 million when compared to the same period in the prior year.

[1] The increase in non-accrual loans includes the initial impact of $278 million related to the adoption of CECL on the portfolio of previously purchased credit deteriorated loans. This includes mortgage loans for $133 million, commercial loans for $131 million and $14 million in consumer loans. 

[2] The legacy portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, construction loans and lease financings related to certain lending products exited by the Corporation as part of restructuring efforts carried out in prior years at the Popular U.S. segment. 

[3] There were $11 million in non-performing commercial loans held-for-sale as of June 30, 2020, none for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. 

[4] It is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to report delinquent residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA as accruing loans past due 90 days or more as opposed to non-performing since the principal repayment is insured. These include loans rebooked, which were previously pooled into GNMA securities amounting to $522 million (December 31, 2019 - $103 million). Under the GNMA program, issuers such as BPPR have the option but not the obligation to repurchase loans that are 90 days or more past due. For accounting purposes, these loans subject to repurchases option are required to be reflected on the financial statements of BPPR with an offseting liability. Loans in our serviced GNMA portfolio benefit from payment forbearance programs but continue to reflect the contractual delinquency until the borrower repays deferred payments or completes a payment deferral modification or other borrower assistance alternative. These balances include $234 million of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed by the VA that are no longer accruing interest as of June 30, 2020 (December 31, 2019 - $213 million). Furthermore, the Corporation has approximately $62 million in reverse mortgage loans which are guaranteed by FHA, but which are currently not accruing interest. Due to the guaranteed nature of the loans, it is the Corporation&#8217;s policy to exclude these balances from non-performing assets (December 31, 2019 - $65 million). 

[5] The carrying value of loans accounted for under ASC Sub-topic 310-30 that are contractually 90 days or more past due was $153 million at December 31, 2019. This amount is excluded from the above table as the loans&#8217; accretable yield interest recognition is independent from the underlying contractual loan delinquency status.

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 

The Corporation adopted the new CECL accounting standard effective on January 1, 2020. The allowance for credit losses (&#8220;ACL&#8221;), represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation&#8217;s management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In this evaluation, management considers current conditions, macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period, historical loss experience, portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics, results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans, and regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 

&#160; 

The Corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries or markets. Other factors that can affect management&#8217;s estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold, may also affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Consequently, the business financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations could also be affected. Refer to Note 4 &#8211; Summary of significant accounting policies included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the Corporation&#8217;s allowance for credit losses methodology. 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses increased by $441 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 to $918 million; an increase of 92%, related to the CECL adoption impact in the first quarter of 2020 of $315 million (&#8220;Day 1 impact&#8221;) in the allowance for credit losses related to loans, combined with changes in the macroeconomic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding such Day 1 impact, the ACL increase of was mainly attributable to the significant change in the macroeconomic conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Incremental reserves in the prior quarter related to the pandemic amounted to $134 million. The ACL for the second quarter of 2020 reflects the current economic outlook, as well as downgrades in the internal credit rating of certain borrowers of the commercial portfolio, related to the impact of the pandemic. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans held-in-portfolio was 3.16% at June 30, 2020, compared to 1.74% at December 31, 2019. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 120.8% compared to 90.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 

The BPPR ACL increased by $323 million to $756 million, or 3.53% of loan-held-in portfolio, from December 31, 2019, mainly driven by the Day 1 impact of $270 million. Consumer and mortgage loans accounted for $122 million and $86 million, respectively of this impact. The Popular U.S. ACL increased by $118 million to $163 million, or 2.13% of loan held-in-portfolio, from December 31, 2019, in part related to the CECL adoption impact of $45 million. Excluding the Day 1 impact, incremental reserves were mainly due to the expected economic impact of COVID-19. 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2020 amounted to $63.1 million, compared to $40.2 million in the same period in the prior year, an increase of $22.9 million, also reflective of the impact of the CECL adoption, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to the Provision for Credit Losses section of this MD&#38;A for additional information. 

&#160; 

The following tables present the breakdown of the allowance for credit losses by loan categories for the periods ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Net charge-offs (&#8220;NCOs&#8221;) for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 amounted to $65.0 million, increasing by $17.8 million, when compared to the same quarter in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher NCOs in the BPPR segment, driven by higher consumer NCOs by $23.6 million (mostly auto and personal loans) , offset in part by lower commercial NCOs by $6.7 million in the PB segment. 

&#160; 

Troubled debt restructurings 

The Corporation&#8217;s TDR loans amounted to $1.6 billion at June 30, 2020, increasing by $11 million, mainly driven by higher TDRs in the BPPR segment. The increase in BPPR was mostly related to higher mortgage TDRs by $16 million, of which $17 million were government guaranteed loans, partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in the BPPR consumer portfolio. At June 30, 2020, the mortgage loan TDRs include $642 million guaranteed by U.S. sponsored entities at BPPR, compared to $625 million at December 31, 2019. TDRs in accruing status increased by $23 million from December 31, 2019, while non-accruing TDRs decreased by $11 million. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Corporation has entered into loan modifications with eligible customers in mortgage, personal loans, credit cards, auto loans and leases and certain commercial credit facilities, comprised mainly of payment deferrals of up to six months, subject to certain terms and conditions. These loan modifications do not affect the asset quality measures as the deferred payments are not deemed to be delinquent and the Corporation continues to accrue interest on these loans. The Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly enacted legislation in April 2020 that required financial institutions to offer through June 2020 moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and recently extended relief with respect to mortgage products through August 2020. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), signed by the President of the United States as part of an economic stimulus package, provided relief related to U.S. GAAP requirements for loan modifications related to COVID-19 relief measures. In addition, the Federal Reserve, along with other U.S. banking 

&#160; 

regulators, also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that offers some practical expedients for evaluating whether loan modifications that occur in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are TDRs. According to the interagency guidance, COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the date of the loan modification are not TDRs, since the lender can conclude that the borrower is current on their loan and thus not experiencing financial difficulties and furthermore the period of the deferral granted does not represent a more than insignificant concession on the part of the lender. In addition, a modification or deferral program that is mandated by the federal government or a state government (e.g., a state program that requires all institutions within that state to suspend mortgage payments for a specified period) does not represent a TDR. Taking into consideration the criteria of whether the borrower was in financial difficulties at the time of the deferral and whether the deferral period was more than insignificant, these payment deferrals as a result of the pandemic have not resulted in a significant increase in TDR loans. Refer to Table 28 for a breakdown of loan modifications completed by the Corporation as part of the COVID-19 relief measures as of June 30, 2020.
