 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

&#160; 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under &#8220;Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2019 Form 10-K. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position, and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Also refer to the discussion in &#8220;Part I - Item 2 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this report for additional information that may supplement or update the discussion of risk factors below and in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

The risks described in our 2019 Form 10-K and in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. 

&#160; 

There have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Item 1A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Form 10-K, except for the risks included below which supplement the risk factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly disrupted the global economy and the markets in which we operate, which has adversely impacted, and is likely to continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operation. Its continued impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. 

&#160; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, created significant volatility in the financial markets, significantly increased unemployment levels worldwide and decreased consumer confidence and commercial activity generally, including in the markets in which we do business, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures. Governments across the world have ordered the temporary closure of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and shelter in place requirements in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to: 

&#160; 

&#61623; Higher and more volatile credit loss expense and potential for increased charge-offs; 

&#61623; Ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries; 

&#61623; A sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets; and 

&#61623; A decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which has led to decreased net interest income. 

&#160; 

In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the Governor has issued several executive orders beginning on March 15, 2020 declaring a health emergency, ordering residents to shelter in place, implementing a mandatory curfew and requiring the closure of all businesses , except for certain businesses that provide essential services, including banking and financial institutions . Certain of the restrictions on the operation of businesses have been eased in recent weeks and the government has stated that it may provide for further easing of such restrictions in a manner that gradually allows for the opening of the economy. Significant restrictions on non-essential business activities remain, however, and many businesses, including retail establishments, remain closed or are operating partially. The government of the USVI and state governments in the U.S. mainland, including New York, New Jersey and Florida, where PB has branches, also declared states of emergency as a result of the pandemic, ordered the temporary closure of all non-essential businesses, and ordered its citizens to remain sheltered in place and to observe social distancing, causing a similar significant economic disruption. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The restrictions imposed by governments in response to the outbreak have caused significant disruption to economic activity and a sharp increase in unemployment in Puerto Rico, which has been facing significant fiscal and economic challenges for over a decade, as well as in the other markets in which we operate. Further deterioration of the Puerto Rico and the broader U.S. economy would be expected to adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to comply with their financial obligations and adversely impact demand for our products and services. The disruption in economic activity would be expected to further adversely affect the financial condition of government entities in Puerto Rico and the USVI to which we have exposure. 

&#160; 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted our operations and already negatively impacted our business, financial condition and operations. Many of BPPR&#8217;s and PB&#8217;s branches were temporarily closed in response to the pandemic. Currently, approximately 75% of BPPR&#8217;s branches are operating and nearly all of PB&#8217;s branches are operating, with some on daily alternating schedules. Furthermore, due to restrictions on non-essential business activities imposed on some of our third-party service providers, certain of BPPR&#8217;s lines of business, including mortgage originations, were temporarily suspended from mid-March to early May. To protect the health and safety of our workforce, we have facilitated a significant portion of our workforce to work remotely, which further exposes the Corporation to heightened risks with respect to cyber-security, information security, other operational incidents and its ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls. Any disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to, or interact with, our clients and customers could result in losses or increased operational costs, regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, or harm our reputation. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, the Corporation has taken measures to ensure the continuity of our operations and the safety of our employees and customers, while providing financial relief to customers through programs such as payment moratoriums, suspensions of foreclosures and other collection activity, as well as waivers of certain fees and service charges. The Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly has enacted legislation requiring financial institutions to offer to clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic moratoriums on consumer financial products through June 2020. The Federal Government has also approved several economic stimulus measures, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic. However, there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact and our participation (or lack of participation) in certain of governmental programs enacted in response to the pandemic could result in reputational harm, litigation and/or regulatory and other government action against the Corporation. Furthermore, moratoriums imposed by Federal and/or state law or provided voluntarily by the Corporation may limit our ability to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that have benefited from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments. 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s results for the first quarter of 2020 already reflect the impact during the month of March 2020 of the business disruption and relief measures described above. For example, the Corporation&#8217;s revenue streams were impacted during the quarter reflecting the impact of reduced consumer transaction activity, the waiver of certain late fees and service charges, as well as the suspension in mortgage origination and related securitization and loan sale activities. The Corporation also incurred additional expenses related to front-line employee bonuses, the enabling of remote access for employees to work from home, the expansion of employee benefits, as well as the impact of specific measures to prevent the spread of the disease and efforts related to customer relief programs, among other related expenses. During the length of the impact of the pandemic, its effects on certain of the Corporation&#8217;s revenue line items, such as interchange income, service charges, debit and credit card fees, mortgage servicing income and gain on sale of mortgage loans, are expected to be more pronounced during at least the second quarter of 2020. The continued effects of the pandemic may also impact the liquidity of the bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries. Moreover, the provision for credit losses for the loans and investments portfolios includes $134 million in incremental reserves due to the expected economic impact of COVID-19. W hile this provision is based on management&#8217;s current best estimate of the impact of the pandemic, there is significant uncertainty with respect to the full extent of its impact and, as a result, the financial impact on the Corporation&#8217;s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position may be significantly greater than that estimated by management and reflected in our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition (including our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios), as well as the operations of our clients, customers, service providers and suppliers, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Even after the pandemic subsides, the global economy may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our 2019 Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 

&#160; 

The COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position may affect the ability of the Corporation to continue paying dividends to its shareholders or repurchase shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock, as well as the value of the Corporation&#8217;s goodwill and its deferred tax assets. 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, the Corporation depends primarily on dividends from its banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund its cash needs, as well as declare dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase shares of its common stock. If as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic the Corporation&#8217;s banking subsidiaries fail to generate sufficient net income to make dividend payments to the bank holding company, this would be expected to have a negative impact on the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition, liquidity, results of operation and capital position and affect the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase shares of its common stock. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely affect the Corporation&#8217;s goodwill and the realizability of its deferred tax assets. For example, a further decline in the Corporation&#8217;s stock price related to global and/or regional macroeconomic conditions, the continued weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and fiscal situation, reduced future earnings estimates and the continuance of the current interest rate environment could have a material impact on the determination of the fair value of our reporting units, which could in turn result in an impairment of goodwill . Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on the expected profitability of our businesses may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our Puerto Rico and U.S. operations. An impairment of goodwill or a write-down of the Corporation&#8217;s deferred tax assets would affect the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition and results of operation.
