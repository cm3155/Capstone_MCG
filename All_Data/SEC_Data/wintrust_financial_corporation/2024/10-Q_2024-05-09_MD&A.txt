MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;Wintrust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of March 31, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, and the results of operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes contained in this report and the risk factors discussed under Item 1A of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (&#8220;2023 Form 10-K&#8221;) and in Part II, Item 1A, of this Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and, as such, future results could differ significantly from management&#8217;s current expectations.

Introduction 

Wintrust is a financial holding company that provides traditional community banking services and offers a full array of wealth management services, primarily to customers in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and northwest Indiana, and operates other financing businesses on a national basis and in Canada through several non-bank business units. 

Overview 

First Quarter Highlights 

The Company recorded net income of $187.3 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $180.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. The results for the first quarter of 2024 demonstrate increased net interest income primarily due to substantial growth in earning assets as well as the Company&#8217;s ability to navigate industry disruptions during the period due to the Company&#8217;s strong deposit franchise and balanced business model. Other key drivers included a favorable valuation adjustment to the fair value of MSRs, net of servicing hedge, and continued good credit quality metrics. Comprehensive income includes 1) net income as presented on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income and 2) other comprehensive income or loss from unrealized gains and losses on the Company&#8217;s available-for-sale investment securities portfolios and derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges as well as foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income totaled $63.4 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $240.4 million for the first quarter of 2023. 

The Company increased its loan portfolio from $39.6 billion at March 31, 2023 and $42.1 billion at December 31, 2023 to $43.2 billion at March 31, 2024. The increase in the current period compared to the prior periods was primarily a result of organic growth in several portfolios, including the commercial, commercial real estate, residential real estate loans held for investment portfolios, and property and casualty insurance premium finance receivable portfolios. For more information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, see Financial Condition &#8211; Interest Earning Assets and Note (6) &#8220;Loans&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report. 

The Company recorded net interest income of $464.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $458.0 million in the first quarter of 2023. This increase in net interest income recorded in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from growth in earning assets, specifically a $3.0 billion increase in average loans. Net interest margin was 3.57% (3.59% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 3.81% (3.83% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities, most notably interest-bearing deposits (see &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest income totaled $140.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $107.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. The overall increase is primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company&#8217;s Retirement Benefits Advisors (&#8220;RBA&#8221;) division within its wealth management business and an increase in mortgage banking by $9.4 million in first quarter of 2024 compared to first quarter of 2023 (see &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; for further detail). 

Non-interest expense totaled $333.1 million in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $34.0 million, or 11%, compared to the first quarter of 2023. This increase compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to increased salaries and employee benefits of $18.4 million, increased FDIC insurance due to the Company&#8217;s recognition of approximately $5.2 million accrued as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023 and increased software and equipment expenses of $3.0 million. (see &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; for further detail). 

Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. See &#8220;Deposits&#8221; and &#8220;Other Funding Sources&#8221; for additional information regarding liquidity sources.

(1) See following section titled &#8220;Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Ratios&#8221; for additional information on this performance measure/ratio. 

(2) Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income. 

(3) The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income, annualizing this amount, and dividing by that period&#8217;s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency. 

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, and quarterly growth rates are &#8220;annualized&#8221; throughout this report to represent an annual time period. This is done for analytical purposes to better discern for decision-making purposes underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, balance sheet growth rates are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate. As such, 5% growth during a quarter would represent an annualized growth rate of 20%. 

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company&#8217;s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company&#8217;s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 

Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is also used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses as a useful measurement of the Company&#8217;s core net income. 

A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is shown below:

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States, prevailing practices of the banking industry, and the application of accounting policies of which are described in Note (1) &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Company&#8217;s 2023 Form 10-K. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At March 31, 2024, management views critical accounting estimates to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 

Allowance for Credit Losses, including the Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Allowance for Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually assessed financial assets, estimated credit losses on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions, all of which are susceptible to significant change. At March 31, 2024, the loan and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios represent 82% of the total assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which relates to certain amounts the Company is committed to lend (not unconditionally cancelable) but for which funds have not yet been disbursed. 

Key macroeconomic variable data points that are significant inputs into our credit loss models for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are the Baa corporate credit spread as well as CREPI specifically related to the commercial real estate portfolio. Holding all other inputs constant, the table below shows the impact of changes in these key macroeconomic variable data points on the estimate of allowance for credit losses. 

Impact to estimated allowance for credit losses from an increased or higher input value Baa Credit Spread Increases CRE Price Index Decreases 

Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios based on a 20 basis point change in Baa credit spreads from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2024: 

Baa Credit Spread Narrows Widens Commercial Decreases estimate by 10%-15% Increases estimate by 15%-20% Commercial Real Estate: Construction Decreases estimate by 15%-20% Increases estimate by 15%-20% Non-Construction Decreases estimate by 4%-5% Increases estimate by 4%-5% 

Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial real estate construction and non-construction portfolios based on a 10% change in CREPI from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2024: 

CRE Price Index Increases Decreases Commercial Real Estate: Construction Decreases estimate by 45%-50% Increases estimate by 95%-100% Non-Construction Decreases estimate by 25%-30% Increases estimate by 55%-60% 

See Note (7) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report and the section titled &#8220;Credit Quality&#8221; in Item 2 of this report for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. 

For a more detailed discussion on these critical accounting estimates, see &#8220;Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; beginning on page 57 of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Net Income 

Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $187.3 million, an increase of $7.1 million, or 4%, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023. On a per share basis, net income for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $2.89 per diluted common share compared to $2.80 for the first quarter of 2023. 

The increase in net income for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily attributable to increased net interest income, higher mortgage banking revenue, and a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company&#8217;s RBA division within its wealth management business, partially offset by higher salaries and benefits and FDIC insurance special assessment. See &#8220;Net Interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-interest Income&#8221;, &#8220;Non-interest Expense&#8221; and &#8220;Credit Quality&#8221; for further detail. 

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of the Company&#8217;s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. 

Quarter Ended March 31, 2024 compared to the Quarters Ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 

The following table presents a summary of the Company&#8217;s average balances, net interest income and related net interest margins, including a calculation on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 (sequential quarters) and first quarter of 2023 (linked quarters):

&#160; NM&#8212;Not Meaningful. 

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 

Wealth management revenue increased by $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to increased asset management fees as a result of higher assets under management during the period. 

Mortgage banking revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of higher net revenue related to MSR activity and valuation adjustments and an increase in loans originated for sale. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. A main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $475.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $372.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in originations from the comparative three month period was driven by growth in both purchase and refinance originations as housing inventories have improved and interest rates pulled back from peak levels reached in 2023. The percentage of origination volume from refinancing activities was 25% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 20%, for the same period in 2023. 

The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio increased as a favorable fair value adjustment of $7.6 million was recorded as well as r etained servicing rights led to capitalization of $5.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in value of $4.4 million due to payoffs, paydowns and repurchases of the existing portfolio. See Note (9) &#8220;Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;)&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs. 

Mortgage banking revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s MSRs portfolio. The change in fair value of the derivative contracts held as an economic hedge was an unfavorable $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 

The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio. These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with holding certain investment securities and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Miscellaneous non-interest income includes loan servicing fees, income from other investments, and other fees. This category of income increased $23.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 2023. The increased income was primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company&#8217;s RBA division within its wealth management business.

NM - Not meaningful. 

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to commissions and incentive compensation as a result of increased incentive bonus accruals and higher commission expense related to increased mortgage production as well as commissions related to the sale of the Company&#8217;s RBA division within its wealth management business in the first quarter of 2024. 

Software and equipment expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of higher software license fees as well as higher computer and software depreciation expense as the Company invests in enhancements to the digital customer experience, upgrades to infrastructure and enhancements to information security capabilities. 

FDIC insurance expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to the Company&#8217;s recognition of approximately $5.2 million accrued as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023. 

Miscellaneous expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent bank charges, directors&#8217; fees, telephone, postage, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses and other miscellaneous operational losses and costs. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $62.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $63.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rates were 25.07% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to 26.01% in the first quarter of 2023. 

The effective tax rates were partially impacted by the tax effects related to share-based compensation which fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other shared-based awards. The 

Company recorded net excess tax benefits of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to net excess tax benefits of $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 related to share-based compensation. 

Operating Segment Results 

The Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. Refer to Note (13) &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this report for further information on the Company&#8217;s primary segments. The Company&#8217;s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. 

The community banking segment&#8217;s net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $363.7 million as compared to $369.8 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 2%. The decrease in the three month period was primarily attributable to increased interest expense on deposit s. The community banking segment&#8217;s non-interest income totaled $74.6 million in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $5.9 million, or 9%, when compared to the first quarter of 2023 total of $68.7 million. The increase in the three month period was primarily the result of increased mortgage banking revenue due to the increase in the fair value of MSRs related to the changes in fair value model assumptions. The community banking segment recorded provision for credit losses of $20.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $21.1 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in provision for credit losses for the three month period was mainly related to narrower forecasted Baa credit spreads. The community banking segment&#8217;s net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $120.0 million, an decrease of $14.2 million as compared to net income in the first quarter of 2023 of $134.2 million. 

The specialty finance segment&#8217;s net interest income totaled $82.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $70.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $11.9 million, or 17%. The increase for the three month period was primarily due to loan growth and increased interest rates on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment&#8217;s non-interest income increased to $27.3 million from $25.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our property and casualty insurance premium finance operations, life insurance finance operations, lease financing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 47%, 32%, 19% and 2%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business for the three month period ended March 31, 2024. The net income of the specialty finance segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 totaled $42.5 million as compared to $36.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. 

The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $7.8 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $9.0 million in the same quarter of 2023, an decrease of $1.2 million, or 13%. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion in the first three months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $58.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $30.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company&#8217;s RBA division within the wealth management business. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment&#8217;s net income totaled $24.7 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. 

Financial Condition 

Total assets were $57.6 billion at March 31, 2024, representing an increase of $4.7 billion, or 9%, when compared to March 31, 2023 and an increase of approximately $1.3 billion, or 9% on an annualized basis, when compared to December 31, 2023. Total funding, which includes deposits, all notes and advances, including secured borrowings and the junior subordinated debentures, was $50.4 billion at March 31, 2024, $49.1 billion at December 31, 2023, and $46.3 billion at March 31, 2023. See Notes (5), (6), (10), (11) and (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for additional period-end detail on the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and funding liabilities.

Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Mortgage loans held-for-sale represents such loans awaiting subsequent sale in the secondary market with such sales eliminating the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provide a source of non-interest revenue. The increase in average balance from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to higher mortgage origination production. 

Loans, net of unearned income. Growth realized in the combined commercial and commercial real estate loan categories for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the sequential and prior year periods is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts. The aggregate balances of these loan categories comprised 58%, 57% and 58% of the average loan portfolio in the first quarter of 2024, fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2023, respectively. 

Residential real estate loans averaged $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024, and increased $394.7 million, or 17% from the average balance of $2.3 billion in same period of 2023. Additionally, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the average balance increased $91.3 million, or 14% on an annualized basis. Growth is due to the Company continuing to allocate a portion of its mortgage production for investment instead of for subsequent sale and servicing in the secondary market. 

The increase in the premium finance receivables during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio due to hardening insurance market conditions driving a higher average size of new property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables as well as effective marketing and customer servicing. Approximately $4.6 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $3.8 billion during the same period of 2023. Premium finance receivables consist of a property and casualty portfolio and a life portfolio comprising approximately 46% and 54%, respectively, of the average total balance of premium finance receivables for the first quarter of 2024, and 42% and 58%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2023. 

Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

Liquidity management assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest bearing deposits with banks. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management&#8217;s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks.

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Such loans may vary in size based on customer need. Primarily as a result of growth in the Company&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to $166.5 million as of March 31, 2024 compared to $149.5 million as of March 31, 2023. 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, 67.8% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of March 31, 2024. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans, aided by our credit management process. As of March 31, 2024, our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was $226.1 million compared to $194.8 million as of March 31, 2023 . The increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily a result of growth in our commercial real estate portfolio as well as a deteriorated forecast in the CREPI macroeconomic variable. The table below sets forth the commercial real estate loans by property type and owner vs. non-owner occupied.

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending, which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. 

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 

Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assigns a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan&#8217;s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. Description of the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating structure used is included in Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

If based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and, if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

Loan Portfolio Aging 

As of March 31, 2024, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, $94.9 million, or 0.2% of all loans, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and $296.9 million, or 0.7% of all loans, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. As of December 31, 2023, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, $69.9 million, or 0.2% of all loans, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and $227.6 million, or 0.5% of all loans, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans shown as 60 to 89 days and 30 to 59 days past due are included on the Company&#8217;s internal problem loan reporting system. Loans on this system are closely monitored by management on a monthly basis. The Company's home equity and residential loan portfolios continue to exhibit low delinquency ratios. Home equity loans at March 31, 2024 that were current with regard to the contractual terms of the loan agreement represent 99.2% of the total home equity portfolio. Residential real estate loans, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, at March 31, 2024 that were current with regards to the contractual terms of the loan agreements comprise 98.5% of total residential real estate loans outstanding. For more information regarding delinquent loans as of March 31, 2024, see Note (7) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in Item 1 of this report.

At this time, management believes reserves are appropriate to absorb losses that are expected upon the ultimate resolution of these credits. Significant increases may occur in subsequent periods due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and related impacts on borrowers. Management will continue to actively review and monitor its loan portfolios, in an effort to identify problem credits in a timely manner.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loans losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management&#8217;s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan. A description of how the Company determines the allowance for credit losses is included in Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at March 31, 2024, and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations and overall levels of net charge-off. Historical trending of both the Company&#8217;s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

Other Real Estate Owned 

In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. The Company employs extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our borrowers. The tables below present a summary of other real estate owned and show the activity for the respective periods and the balance for each property type: 

Three Months Ended (In thousands) March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023 Balance at beginning of period $ 13,309 &#160; $ 9,900 Disposal/resolved &#8212; &#160; (435) Transfers in at fair value, less costs to sell 1,436 &#160; &#8212; Fair value adjustments (207) (104) Balance at end of period $ 14,538 &#160; $ 9,361

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of average deposit balances and the relative percentage of total average deposits for the periods presented: 

Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Balance Percent Balance Percent Balance Percent Non-interest-bearing $ 9,972,646 &#160; 22 &#160; % $ 10,406,585 23 % $ 12,171,631 29 % NOW and interest-bearing demand deposits 5,680,265 &#160; 13 &#160; 5,868,976 13 5,271,740 13 Wealth management deposits 1,510,203 &#160; 3 &#160; 1,704,099 4 2,167,081 5 Money market 14,474,492 &#160; 33 &#160; 14,212,320 32 12,533,468 30 Savings 5,792,118 &#160; 13 &#160; 5,676,155 13 4,830,322 11 Time certificates of deposit 7,148,456 &#160; 16 &#160; 6,645,980 15 5,041,638 12 Total average deposits $ 44,578,180 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 44,514,115 100 % $ 42,015,880 100 % 

Total average deposits for the first quarter of 2024 were $44.6 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 6%, from the first quarter of 2023. Total deposits increased in the first quarter as the Company increased marketing efforts to retain and attract deposits to support continued loan growth. Additionally, the diversity of our deposit base showed its resilience in a volatile market. The Company has experienced a change in the mix of deposits as non-interest bearing deposits have migrated to interest-bearing products. 

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC and trust and asset management customers of the Company which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (&#8220;wealth management deposits&#8221; in the table above). Wealth Management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 

Brokered Deposits 

While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company&#8217;s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below: 

March 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2023 2022 2021 Total deposits $ 46,448,858 &#160; $ 42,718,211 $ 45,397,170 $ 42,902,544 $ 42,095,585 Brokered deposits 4,570,221 &#160; 4,015,271 4,216,718 3,174,093 1,591,083 Brokered deposits as a percentage of total deposits 9.8 &#160; % 9.4 % 9.3 % 7.4 % 3.8 % 

Brokered deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program, and certain deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

Other Funding Sources 

Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include FHLB advances, notes payable, short-term borrowings, secured borrowings, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

Uninsured deposits are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Company&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements. In accordance with the instructions described in the FDIC&#8217;s July 24, 2023 Financial Institution Letter: Estimated Uninsured Deposits Reporting Expectations, the Company had approximately $14.9 billion of uninsured deposits as of March 31, 2024 of which $2.5 billion were fully collateralized deposits. The net position of $12.4 billion of uninsured and 

uncollateralized deposits represents approximately 27% of total deposits as of March 31, 2024. The Company had total liquidity sources, including cash and collateralized funding sources of $14.9 billion or approximately 120% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits as of March 31, 2024. 

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of the average balances of other funding sources for the quarterly periods presented:

See Note (11) &#8220;FHLB Advances, Other Borrowings and Subordinated Notes&#8221; and Note (12) &#8220;Junior Subordinated Debentures&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report for details of period end balances and other information for these various funding sources. The Company hereby incorporates by reference Note (11) and Note (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 1 of this report in its entirety. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

The following tables reflect various consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established for a bank holding company: 

March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Tier 1 leverage ratio 9.4 &#160; % 9.3 % 9.1 % Risk-based capital ratios: Tier 1 capital ratio 10.3 &#160; 10.3 10.1 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 9.5 &#160; 9.4 9.2 Total capital ratio 12.2 &#160; 12.1 12.1 Other ratio:

(1) Reflects the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%. 

(2) Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies (&#8220;BHCs&#8221;) to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 

leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as &#8220;N/A&#8221; in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, we believe the Company&#8217;s capital ratios as of March 31, 2024 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes (11) and (12) of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for further information on these various funding sources. See Note (23) &#8220;Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K for details on the Company&#8217;s issuance of Series D Preferred Stock in June 2015, Series E Preferred Stock and associated Depositary Shares in May 2020 and additional common stock offering in June 2022. 

The Board of Directors approves dividends from time to time, however, the ability to declare a dividend is limited by the Company&#8217;s financial condition, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the terms of the Company&#8217;s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company&#8217;s revolving and term facilities. In January of 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2023, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share. 

The Company continues to leverage its capital management framework to assess and monitor risk when making capital decisions. Management is committed to maintaining the Company&#8217;s capital levels above the &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; levels established by the FRB for bank holding companies. 

Announced Acquisition 

On April 15, 2024, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Macatawa Bank Corporation (&#8220;Macatawa&#8221;). Macatawa offers a full range of banking, retail and commercial lending, wealth management and ecommerce services to individuals, businesses and governmental entities from a network of 26 full-service branches located throughout communities in Kent, Ottawa and northern Allegan counties in the state of Michigan. As of December 31, 2023, Macatawa had approximately $2.7 billion in assets, $2.4 billion in deposits and $1.3 billion in loans. 

LIQUIDITY 

The Company manages the liquidity position of its banking operations to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet customers&#8217; needs for loans and deposit withdrawals. The management process includes the utilization of stress testing processes and other aspects of the Company's liquidity management framework to assess and monitor risk, and inform decision making. The liquidity to meet the demands of customers is provided by maturing assets, liquid assets that can be converted to cash and the ability to attract funds from external sources. Liquid assets refer to money market assets such as Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks, as well as available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are not pledged to secure public funds. In addition, trade date receivables represent certain sales or calls of available-for-sale securities that await cash settlement, typically in the month following the trade date. 

In addition to the liquidity management noted above, in the third quarter of 2023, the Company completed a loan sale transaction within our property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables portfolio which demonstrated that our premium finance portfolio is a strong source of additional liquidity if needed and demonstrated the flexibility to continue to manage our balance sheet effectively. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $405.6 million and a gain on the sale was recorded for approximately $890,000. We maintain our liquid assets to ensure that we would have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to effectively meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. Please refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation -Interest-Earning Assets, -Deposits, -Other Funding Sources and -Shareholders&#8217; Equity sections of this report for additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s liquidity position. 

INFLATION 

A banking organization&#8217;s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation typically do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have as material an impact on the Company&#8217;s business as entities operating in other industries. An analysis of the Company&#8217;s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates. See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; section of this report for additional information.
