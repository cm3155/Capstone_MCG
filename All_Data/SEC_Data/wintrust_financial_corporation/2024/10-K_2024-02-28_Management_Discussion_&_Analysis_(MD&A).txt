NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 

The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company&#8217;s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company&#8217;s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company&#8217;s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 

Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses as a useful measurement of the Company&#8217;s core net income.

OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY 

2023 Highlights 

The Company recorded net income of $622.6 million for the year of 2023 compared to $509.7 million and $466.2 million for the years of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The results for 2023 demonstrate increased net interest income primarily due to increasing net interest margin and significant growth in earning assets, partially offset by an FDIC special assessment, an increase in provision for credit losses due to higher charge-offs for the year, growth in the portfolio and deterioration of forecasted macroeconomic conditions used in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as well as reduced mortgage banking revenue primarily as a result of unfavorable fair value adjustments of mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MS Rs&#8221;), net of servicing hedge, and a decrease in loans originated for sale, partially offset by favorable adjustments to the Company&#8217;s held-for-sale portfolio of early buy-out exercised loans (&#8220;EBOs&#8221;) guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value. 

The Company increased its loan portfolio from $39.2 billion at December 31, 2022 to $42.1 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to growth in several portfolios, including the commercial, industrial and other, commercial real estate, property and casualty premium finance receivables, and residential real estate portfolios. For more information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, see &#8220;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8211; Interest Earning Assets&#8221; and Note (4) &#8220;Loans&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The Company recorded net interest income of $1.8 billion in 2023 compared to $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The higher level of net interest income recorded in 2023 compared to 2022 resulted primarily from a $2.8 billion increase in average earning assets, and a 51 basis point increase in the net interest margin in 2023 (see &#8220;Net Interest Margin&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 

Non-interest income totaled $434.1 million in 2023, decreasing $26.9 million, or 6%, compared to 2022. The decrease in non-interest income in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to decreases in mortgage banking revenues primarily as a result of unfavorable fair value adjustments of MS Rs, net of servicing hedge, and a decrease in loans originated for sale, partially offset by favorable adjustments to the Company&#8217;s held-for-sale portfolio of EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value (see &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 

Non-interest expense totaled $1.3 billion in 2023, increasing $135.2 million, or 11%, compared to 2022. The increase compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to an $51.9 million increase in salary and employee benefits expense and a $42.5 million increase in FDIC insurance expense. (see &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 

Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during 2023, the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. The Company had overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $2.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Economic Environment 

The economic environment in 2023 was characterized by growth in net interest margin due to the continued rising interest rate environment, the related challenges in mortgage banking as a result of such rising interest rate environment, deteriorating economic forecasts and, for banks, the associated impact on the allowance for credit losses as well as heightened competition for deposit funding as rates available for deposit products rose significantly. The Company has employed certain strategies to manage net income in the current rate environment, including those discussed below. 

While the Company&#8217;s business and day-to-day operations are no longer being materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the widespread distribution of vaccines and related boosters, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the continued emergence of various new strains of the virus, may impact the Company&#8217;s future results. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information. 

Net Interest Income 

The Company has leveraged its operating strengths to grow its earning assets base while still benefiting from high interest rates and the resulting impact in net interest margin in 2023. In 2023, the Company's net interest margin increased to 3.66% (3.68% on a fully tax-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) as compared to 3.15% (3.17% on a fully tax-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in 2022, 

##TABLE_START 52 

##TABLE_END

primarily due to higher yields on the Company&#8217;s earning assets and a shift in earning asset mix in 2023 with loans constituting a greater portion of earning assets than liquidity management assets. Significant growth in earning assets resulted in the Company&#8217;s net interest income increasing by $342.5 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Based on contractual terms, approximately 72% of our current loan balances are projected to reprice or mature in 2024. The magnitude of potential changes in net interest income in various interest rate scenarios has continued to diminish. Given the unprecedented rise in interest rates, the Company has made a conscious effort to reposition its exposure to changing interest rates given the uncertainty of the future interest rate environment. To this end, management has executed various derivative instruments including collars and receive fixed swaps to hedge variable rate loan exposures and originated a higher percentage of its loan originations in longer term fixed rate loans. The Company will continue to monitor current and projected interest rates and may execute additional derivatives to mitigate potential fluctuations in the net interest margin in future years. 

The Company has continued its practice of writing call options against certain investment securities to economically hedge the securities positions and receive fee income to compensate for net interest margin compression. In 2023, the Company recognized $21.9 million in fees on covered call options compared to $14.1 million in 2022. 

The Company utilizes &#8220;back to back&#8221; interest rate derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps, to receive floating rate interest payments related to customer loans. In these arrangements, the Company makes a floating rate loan to a borrower who prefers to pay a fixed rate. To accommodate the risk management strategy of certain qualified borrowers, the Company enters a swap with its borrower to effectively convert the borrower's variable rate loan to a fixed rate. However, in order to minimize the Company's exposure on these transactions and continue to receive a floating rate, the Company simultaneously executes an offsetting mirror-image swap with various third parties. 

Non-Interest Income 

The interest rate environment impacts the profitability and mix of the Company&#8217;s mortgage banking business which generated revenues of $83.1 million in 2023 and $155.2 million in 2022, representing 4% and 8% of total net revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Mortgage banking revenue is primarily comprised of gains on sales of mortgage loans originated for new home purchases as well as mortgage refinancing. Mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of MS Rs and EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Mortgage originations for sale totaled $2.0 billion and $2.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, approximately 83% of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases, while 17% of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages. In 2022, approximately 71% of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases, while 29% of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages. 

Non-Interest Expense 

Management believes expense management is important to enhance profitability amid increased competition. Cost control and an efficient infrastructure should position the Company appropriately as it continues its growth strategy. Management continues to be disciplined in its approach to growth and plans to leverage the Company's existing expense infrastructure to expand its presence in existing and complimentary markets. Potentially impacting the cost control strategies discussed above, the Company anticipates increased costs resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate as well as wage inflation, higher FDIC insurance assessments and continued investment in technology. 

Credit Quality 

The Company continues to actively address non-performing assets and remains disciplined in its approach to grow without sacrificing asset quality. 

In particular: 

&#160; 

&#8226; The Company&#8217;s 2023 provision for credit losses totaled $114.4 million compared to a provision of $78.6 million in 2022 and a negative provision of $59.3 million in 2021. The provision in 2023 was primarily the result of higher charge-offs, deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic forecast, specifically the Company&#8217;s macroeconomic forecasts of key model inputs (most notably, Commercial Real Estate Price Index and Baa corporate credit spreads) as well as growth in the Company's loan portfolios. Net charge-offs increased to $45.5 million in 2023 (of which $27.8 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans), compared to $20.3 million in 2022 (of which $10.1 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans) and $21.5 million in 2021 (of which $20.2 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans). 

##TABLE_START 53 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; The Company's allowance for loan and unfunded lending-related commitment losses increased to $427.3 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase of $69.8 million, or 20%, when compared to 2022. At December 31, 2023, approximately $223.9 million, or 52%, of the allowance for loan and unfunded lending-related commitment losses was associated with commercial real estate loans and an additional $169.6 million, or 40%, was associated with commercial loans. 

&#8226; The Company has significant exposure to commercial real estate. At December 31, 2023, $11.3 billion, or 27%, of our loan portfolio was commercial real estate, with approximately 68.8% located in our market area. The commercial real estate loan portfolio was comprised of $2.1 billion in construction and development loans, and $9.3 billion in non-construction loans. In analyzing the commercial real estate market, the Company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data, in large part because the Company&#8217;s market area is diverse and covers many communities, each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the Company&#8217;s general market area. As such, the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other real estate loans made by the Company. The Company uses its multi-chartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks. 

&#8226; Excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, total non-performing loans (loans on non-accrual status and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest) were $139.0 million (of which $35.5 million, or 26% , was related to commercial real estate) at December 31, 2023, an increase of $38.3 million compared to December 31, 2022. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans were 0.33% at December 31, 2023 compared to 0.26% at December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; The Company&#8217;s other real estate owned increased by $3.4 million to $13.3 million during 2023, from $9.9 million at December 31, 2022. The $13.3 million of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2023 was comprised of $12.6 million of commercial real estate property and $720,000 of residential real estate property. 

During 2023, management continued its efforts to aggressively resolve problem loans through liquidation, rather than retention of loans or real estate acquired as collateral through the foreclosure process. Management believes these actions will serve the Company well in the future by providing some protection for the Company from further valuation deterioration and permitting management to spend less time on resolution of problem loans and more time on growing the Company&#8217;s core business and the evaluation of other opportunities. 

The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. The Company&#8217;s practice is generally not to retain long-term fixed-rate mortgages on its balance sheet in order to mitigate interest rate risk, and consequently sells most of such mortgages into the secondary market. These agreements provide recourse to investors through certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. Investors request the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. An increase in requests for loss indemnification can negatively impact mortgage banking revenue as additional recourse expense. The liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was $152,000 at December 31, 2023 and $624,000 at December 31, 2022. 

Community Banking 

Through our community banking franchise, we provide banking and financial services primarily to individuals, small to mid-sized businesses, local governmental units and institutional clients residing primarily in the local areas we service. Profitability of this franchise is primarily driven by our net interest income and margin, our funding mix and related costs, the measurement of the allowance for credit losses and the impact of current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions on such measurement, the level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, the amount of mortgage banking revenue and our history of acquiring banking operations and establishing de novo banking locations. 

Net interest income and margin . The primary source of our revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities to fund those assets, including deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates, customer prepayment patterns, the mix of interest-earning assets and the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. 

Funding mix and related costs. The most significant source of funding in community banking is core deposits, which are comprised of non-interest-bearing deposits, non-brokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and domestic 

##TABLE_START 54 

##TABLE_END

time deposits. Our branch network is the principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Community banking profitability has been favorably impacted in recent years as the Company funded strong loan growth with a more desirable blend of funds. 

Measurement of the allowance for credit losses. The Company adopted CECL as of January 1, 2020, which requires the estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of financial assets measured at amortized cost. To measure lifetime expected credit losses, the Company adjusts credit loss estimates for reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions. Such forecasts can significantly impact the profitability of our community banks as changing estimates of lifetime losses from period to period can result in significant fluctuations in provision for credit losses during those periods. In 2023, such fluctuations in provision for credit losses unfavorably impacted the profitability of our community banks, primarily as a result of deterioration in key variables (Baa credit spread and Commercial Real Estate Price Index) within forecasted macroeconomic conditions. 

Level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned . The level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned can significantly impact our profitability as these loans and other real estate owned do not accrue any income, can be subject to charge-offs and write-downs due to deteriorating market conditions and generally result in additional legal and collections expenses. The Company&#8217;s credit quality measures have remained at historically low levels in recent years. 

Mortgage banking revenue . Our community banking franchise is also influenced by the level of fees generated by the origination of residential mortgages and the sale of such mortgages into the secondary market by Wintrust Mortgage. The Company recognized a decrease of $72.1 million in mortgage banking revenue in 2023 compared to 2022 as origination volumes declined and due to unfavorable fair value adjustments of MSRs in 2023 compared to 2022. Mortgage originations for sale totaled $2.0 billion and $2.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, decreasing as increased interest rates reduced refinance incentives for borrowers. Partially offsetting the impact of lower originations and production margins was the change in fair value on EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. 

Expansion of banking operations. Our historical financial performance has been affected by costs associated with growing market share in deposits and loans, establishing and acquiring banks, opening new branch facilities and building an experienced management team. Our financial performance generally reflects the improved profitability of our banking subsidiaries as they mature, offset by the costs of establishing and acquiring banks and opening new branch facilities. 

In determining the timing of the opening of additional branches of existing banks, and the acquisition of additional banks, we consider many factors, particularly our perceived ability to obtain an adequate return on our invested capital driven largely by the then existing cost of funds and lending margins, the general economic climate and the level of competition in a given market. 

In addition to the factors considered above, before we engage in expansion through de novo branches, we must first make a determination that the expansion fulfills our objective of enhancing shareholder value through potential future earnings growth and enhancement of the overall franchise value of the Company. Generally, we believe that, in normal market conditions, expansion through de novo growth is a better long-term investment than acquiring banks because the cost to bring a de novo location to profitability is generally substantially less than the premium paid for the acquisition of a healthy bank. Each opportunity to expand is unique from a cost and benefit perspective. Both FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions offer a unique opportunity for the Company to expand into new and existing markets in a non-traditional manner. Potential acquisitions are reviewed in a similar manner as a de novo branch opportunities, however, FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions have the ability to immediately enhance shareholder value. Factors including the valuation of our stock, other economic market conditions, the size and scope of the particular expansion opportunity and competitive landscape all influence the decision to expand via de novo growth or through acquisition. 

Specialty Finance 

Through our specialty finance segment, we offer financing of insurance premiums for businesses and individuals; lease financing and other direct leasing opportunities; accounts receivable financing, value-added, out-sourced administrative services; and other specialty finance businesses. 

Financing of Commercial Insurance Premiums 

The primary driver of profitability related to the financing of property and casualty insurance premiums is the net interest spread that FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit. The property and casualty insurance premium finance business is a competitive industry 

##TABLE_START 55 

##TABLE_END

and yields on loans are influenced by the market rates offered by our competitors. The majority of loans originated by FIRST Insurance Funding are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. We fund these loans primarily through our deposits, the cost of which is influenced by competitors in the retail banking markets in our market area. 

Financing of Life Insurance Premiums 

The primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that Wintrust Life Finance can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit. Profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging information technology systems, maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size, each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment. 

Wealth Management 

Through our wealth management segment, we offer a full range of wealth management services through four separate subsidiaries (CTC, Wintrust Investments, Great Lakes Advisors and CDEC): trust and investment services, tax-deferred like-kind exchange services, asset management solutions, securities brokerage services and 401(k) and retirement plan services. 

The primary drivers of profitability of the wealth management business can be associated with the level of commission received related to the trading performed by the brokerage customers for their accounts and the amount of assets under management in which the unit receives a management fee for advisory, administrative and custodial services. As such, revenues are influenced by a rise or fall in the debt and equity markets and the resulting increase or decrease in the value of our client accounts on which our fees are based. The commissions received by the brokerage unit are not as directly influenced by the directionality of the debt and equity markets but rather the desire of our customers to engage in trading based on their particular situations and outlooks of the market or particular stocks and bonds. 

Financial Regulatory Reform 

Our business is heavily regulated and supervised by both federal and state agencies. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors such as the regional banking uncertainty in early 2023, technological updates, and market changes. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. We expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. 

The exact impact of the changing regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon legislative or regulatory changes to reform the financial regulatory framework and the actions of our competitors, customers, and other market participants. Legislative and regulatory changes could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices; requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements; limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities; imposing additional costs and compliance obligations on us; limiting fees we can charge for services; impacting the value of our assets; or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and our earnings&#8217; capabilities. We have already experienced significant increases in compliance related costs in recent years, and we are now subject to more stringent risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements than we were prior to the adoption of the U.S. Basel III Rules. We are also now subject to many mortgage-related rules promulgated by the CFPB that materially restructured the origination, services and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. As discussed under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all insured depository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. Additionally there was a special assessment by the FDIC that was levied on banks with asset size above $5 billion to recoup losses from certain bank failures that occurred earlier in 2023. We will continue to monitor the impact that the implementation of applicable rules, regulations and policies arising out of any legislative or regulatory changes may have on our organization. For further discussion of the laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiary banks, please refer to &#8220;Business-Supervision and Regulation.&#8221;

Recent Transactions 

Business Combination 

On April 3, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Rothschild &#38; Co Asset Management US Inc. and Rothschild &#38; Co Risk Based Investments LLC from Rothschild &#38; Co North America Inc. As of the acquisition date, the Company acquired approximately $12.6 million in net assets. As the transaction was determined to be a business combination, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $2.6 million on the purchase. 

Common Stock Offering 

In June 2022, the Company sold through a public offering a total of 3,450,000 shares of its common stock. Net Proceeds to the Company total approximately $285.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs. 

SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States, prevailing practices of the banking industry, and the application of accounting policies of which are described in Note (1) &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have material impact on the Company&#8217;s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2023, management views critical accounting estimates to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below. 

Allowance for Credit Losses, including the Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Allowance for Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

The allowance for credit losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually assessed financial assets, estimated credit losses on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions, all of which are susceptible to significant change. At December 31, 2023, the loan and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios represent 82% of total assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which relates to certain amounts the Company is committed to lend (not unconditionally cancelable) but for which funds have not yet been disbursed. 

Key macroeconomic variable data points that are significant inputs into our credit loss models for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are the Baa corporate credit spread, as well as the Commercial Real Estate Pricing Index (&#8220;CREPI&#8221;) specifically related to the commercial real estate portfolio. Holding all other inputs constant, the table below shows the impact of changes in these key macroeconomic variable data points on the estimate of allowance for credit losses. 

##TABLE_START Impact to estimated allowance for credit losses from an increased or higher input value Baa Credit Spread Increases CRE Price Index Decreases ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 57 

##TABLE_END

Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios based on a 20 basis point change in Baa credit spreads from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023: 

##TABLE_START Baa Credit Spread Narrows Widens Commercial Decreases estimate by 10%-15% Increases estimate by 20%-25% Commercial Real Estate: Construction Decreases estimate by 15%-20% Increases estimate by 15%-20% Non-Construction Decreases estimate by 4%-5% Increases estimate by 4%-5% ##TABLE_END

Holding all other inputs constant, the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for the commercial real estate construction and non-construction portfolios based on a 10% change in CREPI from the assumption utilized in the estimate of that portfolio&#8217;s allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023: 

##TABLE_START CRE Price Index Increases Decreases Commercial Real Estate: Construction Decreases estimate by 45%-50% Increases estimate by 95%-100% Non-Construction Decreases estimate by 25%-30% Increases estimate by 55%-60% ##TABLE_END

See Note (5) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and the section titled &#8220;Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality&#8221; in Item 7 for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses. 

Estimations of Fair Value 

A portion of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Condition, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These include the Company&#8217;s trading account securities, available-for-sale debt securities, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, derivatives, mortgage loans held-for-sale, certain loans held-for-investment and mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;). The determination of fair value is important for certain other assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, loans individually assessed when measuring a related allowance for credit loss, and other real estate owned that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates. 

Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently verified against observable market data where possible. Where observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on management&#8217;s judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income. See Note (22) &#8220;Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of fair value measurements. 

Impairment Testing of Goodwill 

The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill for each of its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. Using a qualitative approach, the Company reviews any recent events or circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These events and circumstances include the performance of the Company, the condition of the related industry in which the reporting unit operates and general economic environment and other factors. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not that there is impairment based on an evaluation of these events and circumstances, the Company may forgo the quantitative approach. 

##TABLE_START 58 

##TABLE_END

Using a quantitative approach, the Company compares each reporting unit&#8217;s fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit was determined to have been higher than its fair value, the Company would measure and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Any impairment loss would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Valuations are estimated in good faith by management through the use of publicly available valuations of comparable entities and discounted cash flow models using internal financial projections in the reporting unit&#8217;s business plan. 

Under both a qualitative and quantitative approach, the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Events and factors that may significantly affect the analysis include: a significant decline in the Company&#8217;s expected future cash flows, a substantial increase in the discount rate, a sustained, significant decline in the Company&#8217;s stock price and market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate. Other factors might include changing competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, revenue trends, cost structures, along with specific industry and market conditions. Adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of intangible assets and could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had three reporting units: Community Banking, Specialty Finance and Wealth Management. Based on the Company&#8217;s 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was performed qualitatively, the Company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit more likely than not exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units. 

Derivative Instruments 

The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk or market risk. The Company&#8217;s policy prohibits using derivatives for speculative purposes. 

Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as an accounting hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific asset or liability or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased. In order to qualify as an accounting hedge, a derivative must be designated as such at inception by management and meet certain criteria. Management must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item. To determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge, the Company must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of the hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. If the Company&#8217;s hedging strategy were to become ineffective, hedge accounting would no longer apply and the reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. See Note (21) &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of derivative accounting. 

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states, Canada and other jurisdictions where it conducts business. These laws are complex and subject to potentially different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Company&#8217;s tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. Management reviews its uncertain tax positions and recognition of the benefits of such positions on a regular basis. 

On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on a quarterly basis, if business events or circumstances warrant. Additionally, any enactment of new tax rates requires the Company to re-measure its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate, with such adjustments recognized in current year earnings. See Note (17) &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of income taxes.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion of Wintrust&#8217;s results of operations requires an understanding that a majority of the Company&#8217;s bank subsidiaries have been started as de novo banks since December 1991. Wintrust has a strategy of continuing to build its customer base and securing broad product penetration in each marketplace that it serves. The Company has expanded its banking franchise from three banks with five offices in 1994 to 15 banks with 174 offices at the end of 2023. FIRST Insurance Funding and Wintrust Life Finance have matured into separate divisions that generated, on a national basis, $16.1 billion in total premium finance receivables in 2023 within the United States. FIFC Canada, acquired in 2012, originated $1.8 billion in Canadian property and casualty premium finance receivables in 2023. The Company&#8217;s leasing business increased its portfolio of assets, including direct financing leases, loans and equipment on operating leases, to $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the wealth management companies have been building a team of experienced professionals who are located within a majority of the banks. 

Earnings Summary 

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023, totaled $622.6 million, or $9.58 per diluted common share, compared to $509.7 million, or $8.02 per diluted common share, in 2022, and $466.2 million, or $7.58 per diluted common share, in 2021. During 2023, net income increased by $112.9 million and earnings per diluted common share increased by $1.56. Net interest income increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in the net interest margin as well as growth in average earning assets in 2023. Partially offsetting the increase to net income from higher net interest income was a higher provision for credit losses. The Company&#8217;s provision for credit losses increased in 2023 primarily due to higher net charge-offs coupled with deterioration of forecasted macroeconomic conditions used in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses. Mortgage banking revenue decreased in 2023 as compared 2022 primarily as a result of unfavorable fair value adjustments of MSRs, net of servicing hedge, and a decrease in loans originated for sale, partially offset by favorable adjustments to the Company&#8217;s held-for-sale portfolio of EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value. 

Other items impacting net income in 2023 compared to 2022 include increased salary and employee benefits expenses and higher FDIC insurance costs in 2023 primarily due to the FDIC special assessment in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023. 

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of the Company&#8217;s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income in 2023 totaled $1.84 billion, up from $1.50 billion in 2022 and up from $1.12 billion in 2021, representing an increase of $342.5 million, or 23%, in 2023 and an increase of $370.4 million, or 33%, in 2022. The table presented later in this section, titled &#8220;Changes in Interest Income and Expense,&#8221; presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and expense, by major category, attributable to changes in the volume of the balance sheet category and changes in the rate earned or paid with respect to that category of assets or liabilities for 2023 and 2022. 

Average earning assets increased $2.8 billion, or 6%, in 2023 and $3.6 billion, or 8%, in 2022. Loans are the most significant component of the earning asset base as they earn interest at a higher rate than the majority of other earning assets. Average loans increased $3.6 billion, or 10%, in 2023 and $3.6 billion, or 11%, in 2022. Total average loans as a percentage of total average earning assets were 80%, 77% and 75% in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The average yield on loans was 6.32% in 2023, 4.12% in 2022 and 3.43% in 2021, reflecting an increase of 220 basis points in 2023 and an increase of 69 basis points in 2022. The higher loan yields in 2023 compared to 2022 is primarily a result of the increase in the interest rate environment in 2023 compared to 2022. The average yield on liquidity management assets was 3.53% in 2023, 2.15% in 2022 and 1.14% in 2021, reflecting an increase of 138 basis points in 2023 and an increase of 101 basis points in 2022. The higher yield in 2023 compared to 2022 is also a result of the increase in the interest rate environment in 2023 compared to 2022. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, the largest component of the Company&#8217;s interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.81% in 2023, 0.62% in 2022 and 0.33% in 2021, representing an increase of 219 basis points in 2023 and an increase of 29 basis points in 2022. The higher level of interest-bearing deposits rates in 2023 compared to 2022 is also primarily a result of the increase in the interest rate environment in 2023 compared to 2022. As a result of the above, net interest margin increased to 3.66% (3.68% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in 2023 compared to 3.15% (3.17% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in 2022. 

##TABLE_START 60 

##TABLE_END

Net interest income and net interest margin were also affected by amortization of valuation adjustments to earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of acquired businesses. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are required to be recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. These valuation adjustments represent the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of assets and liabilities acquired. These adjustments are amortized into interest income and interest expense based upon the estimated remaining lives of the assets and liabilities acquired. 

Average Balance Sheets, Interest Income and Expense, and Interest Rate Yields and Costs 

The following table sets forth the average balances, the interest earned or paid thereon, and the effective interest rate, yield or cost for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The yields and costs include loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs that are considered adjustments to yields. Interest income on non-accruing loans is reflected in the year that it is collected, to the extent it is not applied to principal. Such amounts are not material to net interest income or the net change in net interest income in any year. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances. Net interest income and the related net interest margin have been adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income, such as interest on municipal securities and loans, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). This table should be referred to in conjunction with discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

The changes in net interest income are created by changes in both interest rates and volumes. In the table above, volume variances are computed using the change in volume multiplied by the previous year&#8217;s rate. Rate variances are computed using the change in rate multiplied by the previous year&#8217;s volume. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 

Mortgage banking revenue decreased in 2023 as compared 2022 primarily as a result of unfavorable fair value adjustments of MSRs, net of servicing hedge, and a decrease in loans originated for sale, partially offset by favorable adjustments to the Company&#8217;s held-for-sale portfolio of early buy-out exercised loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. A main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $2.0 billion for the year ended 2023 compared to $2.8 billion for the same period of 2022. The decrease in originations was primarily due to increased interest rates reducing refinance incentives for borrowers. The percentage of origination volume from refinancing activities was 17% in 2023 as compared to 29% in 2022. 

The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. During 2023, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio decreased due to a reduction in value of $17.1 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio, an unfavorable fair value adjustment of $19.1 million, and a bulk sale of MSRs of $30.2 million, partially offset by retained servicing rights which led to capitalization of $28.6 million. See Note (6) &#8220;Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;)&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs. 

Mortgage banking revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s MSRs portfolio. The change in fair value of the derivative contracts held as an economic hedge during 2023 was a $1.3 million favorable valuation adjustment compared to a $2.2 million unfavorable valuation adjustment in 2022. The table below presents additional selected information regarding mortgage banking for the respective periods.

Net gains on investment securities in 2023 were primarily the result of unrealized gains on equity investments. The Company did not recognize any credit-related write-downs or other-than-temporary impairment charges within its available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio in 2023 or 2022, respectively. 

The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio. These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with holding certain investment securities and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Bank owned life insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of upward adjustments to the cash surrender value of BOLI policies. This income typically represents adjustments to the cash surrender value of BOLI policies and proceeds received from death benefits. The Company initially purchased BOLI to consolidate existing term life insurance contracts of executive officers and to mitigate the mortality risk associated with death benefits provided for in executive employment contracts and in connection with certain deferred compensation arrangements. The Company has also assumed additional BOLI policies as the result of the acquisition of certain banks. The cash surrender value of BOLI totaled $160.2 million at December 31, 2023 and $157.3 million at December 31, 2022, and is included in other assets. 

Miscellaneous non-interest income includes loan servicing fees, income from other investments, service charges and other fees. The increased miscellaneous other income for 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily the result of decreased contingent consideration accrued in 2023 related to previous acquisitions, $2.5 million of losses recorded in 2022 relating to the sale of a property no longer considered for future expansion and losses on the sale of a former data processing facility in 2022, as well as increased fee income in 2023 earned on card-related arrangements, letters of credit and other commitments.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 

Salaries and employee benefits is the largest component of non-interest expense, accounting for 57% of the total in 2023 compared to 59% in 2022. Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of increased salaries and benefits expense as the Company grows, partially offset by decreased commissions and incentive compensation expense primarily due to lower commission expense due to reduced mortgage production. 

Software and equipment expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily as a result of increased software licensing expenses as the Company invests in enhancements to the digital customer experience, upgrades to infrastructure and enhancements to information security capabilities. Software and equipment expense includes furniture, equipment and computer software, depreciation and repairs and maintenance costs. 

Occupancy expense for the years 2023 and 2022 was $77.1 million and $71.0 million, respectively, reflecting an increase of 9% in 2023. Occupancy expense includes depreciation on premises, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities and maintenance of premises, as well as net rent expense for leased premises. In 2023, the Company recognized impairment totaling $2.9 million of two Company-owned buildings that are no longer being used. Additionally, the increase was partly attributable to lower rental income from the Company&#8217;s office space available for lease as well as higher maintenance, repairs and other costs at the Company&#8217;s owned properties. 

Data processing expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to additional costs related to the termination of a duplicate service contract related to the acquisition of a wealth management business in 2023. Further, the increase was attributable to additional costs from certain system conversion processes completed in 2023. 

Advertising and marketing costs are incurred to promote the Company&#8217;s brand, commercial banking capabilities, the Company&#8217;s MaxSafe &#174; suite of products, community-based products, to attract loans and deposits and to announce new branch 

##TABLE_START 67 

##TABLE_END

openings as well as the expansion of the Company&#8217;s non-bank businesses. The increased expense in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily as a result of higher television and other media advertising costs as well as increased sponsorship activity. The level of marketing expenditures depends on the type of marketing programs utilized which are determined based on the market area, targeted audience, competition and various other factors. Management continues to utilize mass market media promotions as well as targeted marketing programs in certain market areas. 

FDIC insurance expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the Company&#8217;s recognition of approximately $34.4 million accrued for the estimated amount owed as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023. The increase in expense is also due to the FDIC&#8217;s increase of the basis rate beginning with the first quarterly assessment period in 2023 as well as asset growth. 

Miscellaneous non-interest expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent banking charges, directors&#8217; fees, telephone, postage, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses and other miscellaneous operational losses and costs. Miscellaneous non-interest expense increased in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily as a result of various other operational costs including an increase in interest payments made on collateral received for outstanding interest rate derivative contracts. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $222.5 million in 2023 compared to $190.9 million in 2022 and $171.6 million 2021. The effective tax rates were 26.3% in 2023, 27.2% in 2022 and 26.9% in 2021. The effective tax rate in 2023 is slightly lower due to the Company&#8217;s income tax expense being impacted by an increase in federal tax credits claimed and an overall lower level of provision for state income taxes versus the comparable periods. Income tax expense was also impacted by the tax effects related to the issuance of shares in share-based compensation plans. These tax effects fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other share based awards. The Company recorded a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation of $2.9 million in 2023, a net excess tax benefit of $2.9 million 2022, and a net excess tax benefit of $2.4 million in 2021, the majority of which were recognized in the first quarter in each year. Please refer to Note (17) &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion and analysis of the Company&#8217;s tax position, including a reconciliation of the tax expense computed at the statutory tax rate to the Company&#8217;s actual tax expense. 

Operating Segment Results 

As described in Note (24) &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. The Company&#8217;s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment&#8217;s risk-weighted assets. 

The community banking segment&#8217;s net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $1.4 billion as compared to $1.2 billion for the same period in 2022, an increase of $260.8 million, or 22%. The increase in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to increased interest and fees on loans due to loan growth and increased interest rates, partially offset by increased interest expense on deposit s . The community banking segment recorded a provision for credit losses of $104.9 million in 2023 compared to $74.2 million in 2022. The provision for credit losses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher net charge-offs coupled with deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast and loan growth compared to 2022. Non-interest income for the community banking segment decreased $35.5 million, or 12% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The decrease in non-interest income in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily the result of unfavorable fair value adjustments of MSRs and reduced mortgage banking revenue due to lower originations for sale. The community banking segment&#8217;s net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $414.1 million, an increase of $64.7 million, compared to net income of $349.3 million in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net interest income in 2023 partially offset by increased provision for credit losses and reduced mortgage banking revenue, as discussed above. 

The specialty finance segment&#8217;s net interest income totaled $329.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $246.7 million in the same period of 2022, an increase of $82.4 million, or 33%. The increase in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to loan growth and increased interest rates on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment&#8217;s provision for credit losses totaled $9.5 million in 2023 compared to $4.4 million in 2022 primarily due to 

##TABLE_START 68 

##TABLE_END

higher net charge-offs coupled with deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast and loan growth compared to 2022. The specialty finance segment&#8217;s non-interest income increased to $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $97.7 million in 2022. For 2023, our commercial premium finance operations, life insurance premium finance operations, leasing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 44%, 35%, 18% and 3%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business. Net income of the specialty finance segment totaled $175.5 million and $120.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $32.7 million for 2023 and $38.3 million for 2022. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $136.6 million for 2023 as compared to $124.6 million for 2022. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company as the number of brokers in its banks continues to increase. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment reported net income of $33.0 million for 2023 compared to $39.4 million for 2022.

##TABLE_START 69 

##TABLE_END

Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Average mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $294.4 million in 2023, compared to $496.1 million in 2022. These balances represent mortgage loans awaiting subsequent sale in the secondary market with such sales eliminating the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provides a source of non-interest revenue. The decrease in average balance from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to lower mortgage origination production balances. See &#8220;Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for additional discussion of these early buyout options. 

Loans, net of unearned income. Average total loans, net of unearned income, totaled $40.3 billion and increased $3.6 billion, or 10%, in 2023. Average commercial loans totaled $12.5 billion in 2023, and increased $581.0 million, or 5%, over the average balance in 2022. Average commercial real estate loans totaled $10.6 billion in 2023, increasing $1.2 billion, or 13%, since 2022. Combined, these categories comprised 57% and 58% of the average loan portfolio in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The growth realized in these categories for 2023 is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts during the period. 

Home equity loans averaged $337.8 million in 2023, and increased $10.3 million, or 3%, when compared to the average balance in 2022. Unused commitments on home equity lines of credit totaled $845.6 million at December 31, 2023 and $796.9 million at December 31, 2022. The Company has been actively managing its home equity portfolio to ensure that diligent pricing, appraisal and other underwriting activities continue to exist. 

Residential real estate loans averaged $2.5 billion in 2023, and increased $529.2 million, or 27%, from the average balance in 2022. The increase in average balance was partially due to the Company deciding to allocate more balances from its mortgage production for investment instead of for subsequent sale and servicing in the secondary market. 

Average premium finance receivables totaled $14.3 billion in 2023, and accounted for 35% of the Company&#8217;s average total loans. In 2023, average premium finance receivables increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, compared to 2022. The increase during 2023 was the result of effective marketing and customer servicing as well as continued originations within the portfolio due to hardening insurance market conditions driving a higher average size of new property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables. Approximately $17.9 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in 2023 compared to approximately $15.4 billion in 2022. 

Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

Liquidity Management Assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short-term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest-bearing deposits with banks. Average liquidity management assets accounted for 19% and 22% of total average earning assets in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Average liquidity management assets decreased $663.0 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management&#8217;s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. 

Other earning assets. Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. In the normal course of business, Wintrust Investments activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various securities transactions. Wintrust Investments customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, Wintrust Investments, under an agreement with the out-sourced securities firm, extends credit to its customer, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in customer&#8217;s accounts. In connection with these activities, Wintrust Investments executes and the out-sourced firm clears customer transactions relating to the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. Such transactions may expose Wintrust Investments to off-balance-sheet risk, particularly in volatile trading markets, in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur. In the event a customer fails to satisfy its obligations, Wintrust Investments under an agreement with the out-sourced securities firm, may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer's obligations. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers&#8217; activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. Wintrust Investments monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.

Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality 

Loan Portfolio 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans. Our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are comprised primarily of commercial real estate loans and lines of credit for working capital purposes.

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Such loans may vary in size based on customer need. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. Primarily as a result of growth in the portfolio and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and expectations between the two reporting dates primarily related to the Baa credit spread, our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to $169.6 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $142.8 million as of December 31, 2022. 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, 68.8% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of December 31, 2023. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was $223.9 million compared to $184.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily due to portfolio growth and the impact on the Company&#8217;s loan loss modeling from deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and expectations between the two reporting dates primarily related to the Baa credit spread and the Commercial Real Estate Price Index. The table below sets forth the commercial real estate loans by property type and owner vs. non-owner occupied.

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. Amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within 21 days. 

Home equity loans. The Company&#8217;s home equity loans and lines of credit are primarily originated by each of the bank subsidiaries in their local markets where there is a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. The Company&#8217;s banks monitor and manage these loans, and conduct an automated review of all home equity lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects FICO and Bankruptcy scores for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining. When other specific events occur that may influence repayment, information such as tax liens or judgments is collected. The bank subsidiaries use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. In a limited number of cases, the Company may issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis. 

The rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors, including appraisals and valuation due diligence, in order to reflect inherent risk, and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests. It is not our practice to advance more than 85% of the appraised value of the underlying asset, which ratio we refer to as the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio, and a majority of the credit we previously extended, when issued, had an LTV ratio of less than 80%. Our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market. 

Residential real estate. The Company&#8217;s residential real estate portfolio includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as well as certain long-term fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2023, our residential loan portfolio totaled $2.8 billion, or 7% of our total outstanding loans. 

Our adjustable rate mortgages are often non-agency conforming. Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio. However, this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2023, excluding early buyout loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, $15.4 million of our residential real estate mortgages, or 0.6% of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual, no balances were 90 or more days past due and still accruing, $25.3 million were 30 to 89 days past due or 1.0% and $2.6 billion were current or 98.4%. We believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority 

##TABLE_START 75 

##TABLE_END

of our borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. 

Due to interest rate risk considerations, the Company generally sells in the secondary market loans originated with long-term fixed rates, for which we receive fee income. The Company also selectively retains certain of these loans within the banks&#8217; own loan portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. A portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained. The amount of loans serviced for others as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $12.0 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively. All other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights. 

The GNMA optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buyout individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing,&#8221; this early buyout option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans at fair value, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the early buyout option. These rebooked loans are reported as loans held-for-investment, part of the residential real estate portfolio, with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. When the early buyout option on these rebooked GNMA loans is exercised, the repurchased loans continue to be carried at fair value. Additionally, such loans typically transfer to mortgage loans held-for-sale at the time of early buyout as the Company&#8217;s intent is to cure and resell such loans subsequent to repurchase from GNMA. If such intent to cure and resell changes subsequent to early buyout, the Company reclassifies such loans as held-for-investment. Early buyout loan classified as held-for-investment totaled $150.6 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $164.8 million at December 31, 2022. Such loans consist of both the rebooked GNMA loans and the early buyout exercised loans classified as held-for-investment discussed above. Rebooked GNMA loans held-for-investment amounted to $92.8 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $80.7 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in balance from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was the result of higher delinquencies between periods and less frequent exercising of the early buyout option by the Company. As of December 31, 2023, early buyout exercised loans held-for-investment totaled $57.8 million compared to $84.1 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $137.2 million and $143.6 million, respectively. The decline in early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale relative to the prior year is primarily due to the resale of mortgage loans to GNMA as well as the reclassification of certain loans to held-for-investment classification due to an inability to resell due to continued delinquency. 

It is not the Company&#8217;s current practice to underwrite, and there are no plans to underwrite subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. As of December 31, 2023, none of our mortgage loans consist of interest-only loans. 

Premium finance receivables &#8212; property &#38; casualty. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $16.4 billion in property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables during 2023 as compared to approximately $13.6 billion in 2022. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada makes loans to finance insurance premiums related to property and casualty insurance policies. The loans are indirectly originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers&#8217; purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of fraud. The majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. 

Premium finance receivables &#8212; life insurance. Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $1.5 billion in life insurance premium finance receivables in 2023 as compared to $1.8 billion in 2022. The Company continues to experience a high level of competition and pricing pressure within the current market. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, Wintrust Life Finance may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position. 

Consumer and other. Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. The Company originates consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to its customers. 

##TABLE_START 76 

##TABLE_END

Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

Foreign. The Company had approximately $920.4 million of loans to businesses with operations in foreign countries as of December 31, 2023 compared to $745.6 million at December 31, 2022. This balance as of December 31, 2023 consists of loans originated by FIFC Canada. 

Loan Concentrations 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. The Company had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2023, except for loans included in the specialty finance operating segment, which are diversified throughout the United States and Canada.

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 

The Company&#8217;s ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on its ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating (1 to 10 rating, with higher scores indicating higher risk) to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis. For loans measured at amortized cost, these credit risk ratings are also an important aspect of the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses measurement methodology. The credit risk rating structure and classifications are shown below: 

##TABLE_START 1 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Minimal Risk (Loss Potential &#8212; none or extremely low) (Superior asset quality, excellent liquidity, minimal leverage) 2 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Modest Risk (Loss Potential demonstrably low) (Very good asset quality and liquidity, strong leverage capacity) 3 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Average Risk (Loss Potential low but no longer refutable) (Mostly satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, good leverage capacity) 4 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Above Average Risk (Loss Potential variable, but some potential for deterioration) (Acceptable asset quality, little excess liquidity, modest leverage capacity) 5 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Management Attention Risk (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Generally acceptable asset quality, somewhat strained liquidity, minimal leverage capacity, minimum for all commercial real estate construction loans) 6 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Special Mention (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Assets in this category are currently protected, potentially weak, but not to the point of substandard classification) 7 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Substandard Accrual (Loss Potential distinct possibility that the bank may sustain some loss, but no discernible impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt) 8 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Substandard Non-accrual (Loss Potential well documented probability of loss, including potential impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt) 9 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Doubtful (Loss Potential extremely high) (These assets have all the weaknesses in those classified &#8220;substandard&#8221; with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly improbable) 10 Rating &#160; &#8212; &#160; Loss (fully charged-off) (Loans in this category are considered fully uncollectible.) ##TABLE_END

Generally, each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including: a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company maintains an internal loan review function to independently review a portion of the loan portfolio to evaluate the appropriateness of the management-assigned credit risk ratings. These ratings are subject to further review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago and the OCC, and are also reviewed by our internal loan review staff and our internal audit staff. 

The Company&#8217;s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all such loans described above with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and, as a result, no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool. If that is the case, the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss. The Company&#8217;s individual assessment utilizes an 

##TABLE_START 79 

##TABLE_END

independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company&#8217;s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. 

Through the credit risk rating process, such loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status or a charge-off. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible, the loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

The Company&#8217;s approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the credit-risk rating process. A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for enhanced loan modifications that now must be disclosed in accordance with ASU 2022-02. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be enhanced if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be an enhanced modification. Based on the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered enhanced modifications. 

Loan modifications are assessed at the time of the modification and on a quarterly basis to measure an allowance for credit loss. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral. Any shortfall is recorded as a reserve. 

For loans that do not meet the criteria listed above for enhanced modifications, if based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

Non-Performing Assets (1) 

The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s non-performing assets, and for the years prior to 2023, the TDRs performing under the contractual terms of the loan agreement as of the dates shown. Reporting periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 as of January 1, 2023 present information on loan modifications representing TDRs under the prior accounting standards and related disclosure requirements. Prior to January 1, 2020, Purchased Credit-Impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans were aggregated into pools by common risk characteristics for accounting purposes, including recognition of interest income on a pool basis. As a result of the implementation of CECL, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, PCI loans transitioned to a classification of Purchased Credit Deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) loans, which no longer maintains the prior pools and related accounting concepts. Recognition of interest income on PCD loans is considered at the individual asset level following the Company&#8217;s accrual policies, instead of based upon the entire pool of loans. Due to the adoption of CECL, the Company included $22.6 million of PCD loans in total non-performing loans as of December 31, 2020.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management&#8217;s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan, as described below under &#8220;How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this Item 7.

Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2023, and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations and overall levels of net charge-off. Historical trending of both the Company&#8217;s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

(1) The initial allowance for credit losses on PCD loans acquired during the period measured approximately $2.8 million, of which approximately $2.3 million was charged off related to PCD loans that met the Company&#8217;s charge-off policy at the time of acquisition. After considering these loans that were immediately charged off, the net impact of PCD allowance for credit losses at the acquisition date was approximately $470,000 in 2021. 

NM&#8212;Not Meaningful 

The allowance for credit losses, as related to loans and lending-related commitments, is comprised of an allowance for loan losses, which is determined with respect to loans that we have originated, and an allowance for unfunded commitment losses. A separate allowance for held-to-maturity securities losses is measured related to such debt securities portfolio. Our allowance for unfunded commitment losses is determined with respect to funds that we have committed to lend but for which funds have not

yet been disbursed and is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $83.0 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $87.3 million as of December 31, 2022. 

Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs represent the amount of loans that have been determined to be uncollectible during a given period, and are deducted from the allowance for credit losses, and recoveries represent the amount of collections received from loans that had previously been charged off, and are credited to the allowance for credit losses. See Note (5) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for credit losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio. 

How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis by loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan no longer exhibits risk characteristics similar to that of a pool, typically due to credit deterioration of the related borrower, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of individually assessing a specific allowance for credit loss as part of the Problem Loan Reporting system review. A separate reserve is collectively measured for loans continuing to share risk characteristics and, as a result, remaining in the pools. See Note (5) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses measurement process. 

Collective Measurement 

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist, based upon the segmentation discussed above. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company on a quantitative or qualitative basis and incorporates third party economic forecasts. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. Currently, the Company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using a single macroeconomic scenario provided by a third party and reviewed within the Company's governance structure. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level, straight-line over a four quarter reversion period. Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are considered when the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable. The methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition and off-balance sheet commitments (i.e. unfunded lending-related commitments). 

Individual Assessment 

Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. In cases in which collectability is not probable, the loan is considered to no longer exhibit shared risk characteristics of a pool and as a result, is individually assessed for allowance for credit losses measurement purposes. If a loan is individually assessed credit risk rating 8 or 9, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for foreclosure-probable and collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell, when appropriate under accounting rules. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve within the allowance for credit losses. 

Home Equity, Residential Real Estate and Consumer Loans 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for home equity, residential real estate and consumer loans differs from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans. These portfolios utilize the weighted-average remaining maturity (&#8220;WARM&#8221;) methodology. The WARM methodology is an assumption-based approach that utilizes historical loss and prepayment information as the basis to estimate prepayment and credit adjusted contractual cash flows. The Company considers a qualitative factor to adjust historical information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The same credit risk rating system and Problem Loan Reporting systems are used. The only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans. 

##TABLE_START 85 

##TABLE_END

The home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current FICO and Bankruptcy scores of the borrowers, line availability, recent line usage, approaching maturity, and the aging status of the loan. Certain of these factors, or combination of these factors, may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be downgraded. Similar to commercial and commercial real estate loans, once a home equity loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is downgraded to a 6 through 9, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division reviews and advises the subsidiary banks as to collateral valuations and as to the ultimate resolution of the credits that deteriorate to a non-accrual status to minimize losses. 

Residential real estate loans that are downgraded to a credit risk rating of 6 through 9 also enter the problem loan reporting system and have the underlying collateral evaluated by the Managed Assets Division. 

Premium Finance Receivables 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for premium finance receivables is an assumption-based approach focusing on historical loss rates in the portfolio, adjusted qualitatively for current macroeconomic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

Methodology in Assessing Impairment and Charge-off Amounts 

In determining the amount of reserves or charge-offs associated with collateral dependent loans, the Company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs, if appropriate, to arrive at a net appraised value. We obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisal firms. Types of appraisal valuations include &#8220;as-is,&#8221; &#8220;as-complete,&#8221; &#8220;as-stabilized,&#8221; bulk, fair market, liquidation and &#8220;retail sellout&#8221; values. 

In many cases, the Company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type. If the Company receives offers or indications of interest, we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral. Additionally, the Company takes into account the strength of any guarantees or other credit enhancements, and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate charge-off or reserve associated with any individually assessed loans. Accordingly, the Company may charge-off a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value. Alternatively, the Company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the Company has a guarantee from a borrower or other credit enhancements that the Company believes has realizable value. In evaluating the strength of any guarantee, the Company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor, the guarantor&#8217;s reputation, and the guarantor&#8217;s willingness and desire to work with the Company. The Company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant. 

In circumstances where the Company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest, the Company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately 90 days. To the extent that the realtors&#8217; indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation, the Company may take a charge-off on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation. 

The Company may also charge-off a loan below the net appraised valuation if the Company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, the Company may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full. 

In other cases, the Company may allow the borrower to conduct a &#8220;short sale,&#8221; which is a sale where the Company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan. Many times, it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price. To the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal, we may take a charge-off beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated. 

##TABLE_START 86 

##TABLE_END

Other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower and/or property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral. 

Having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan, the Company arrives at a charge-off amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for credit losses. In summary, for collateral dependent loans, appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value. Estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value, when appropriate under current accounting rules, to arrive at the net appraised value. Although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for charge-offs on collateral dependent loans, alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates. As a result, we may utilize values obtained through these alternative sources, which include purchase and sale agreements, legitimate indications of interest, negotiated short sales, realtor price opinions, sale of the note or support from guarantors, as the basis for charge-offs. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. In addition, if an appraisal is not deemed current, a discount to appraised value may be utilized. Any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division. 

Potential Problem Loans 

Management believes that any loan where there are serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms should be identified as a non-performing loan and should be included in the disclosure of &#8220;Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets.&#8221; At end of the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had no potential problem loans not already identified as non-performing. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. The Company employs extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our borrowers. The tables below present a summary of other real estate owned and show the activity for the respective periods and the balance for each property type:

Deposits and Other Funding Sources 

Total deposits at December 31, 2023, were $45.4 billion, increasing $2.5 billion, or 6%, compared to the $42.9 billion at December 31, 2022. Average deposit balances in 2023 were $43.3 billion, reflecting an increase of $1.4 billion, or 3%, compared to the average balances in 2022. 

##TABLE_START 87 

##TABLE_END

The increase in year end and average deposits in 2023 over 2022 is primarily attributable to the Company's increased marketing efforts during 2023 to retain and attract deposits to support continued loan growth, and due to the diversity of our deposit base. The Company has experienced a change in the mix of deposits as non-interest bearing deposits have migrated to interest-bearing products as rates paid on deposits increased substantially in 2023 due to the rise in market rates. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased $2.6 billion, or 19% in 2023 compared to 2022, with period end balances ending at 23% of total deposits at December 31, 2023, compared to 30% at December 31, 2022.

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC and trust and asset management customers of the Company which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (&#8220;wealth management deposits&#8221; in the table above). Wealth management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks. 

Other Funding Sources. Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include FHLB advances, notes payable, short-term borrowings, secured borrowings, subordinated debt, and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

Uninsured deposits are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Company&#8217;s regulatory reporting requirements. In accordance with the instructions described in the FDIC&#8217;s July 24, 2023 Financial Institution Letter: Estimated Uninsured Deposits Reporting Expectations, the Company had approximately $15.2 billion of uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2023, of which $2.3 billion were fully collateralized deposits. The net position of $12.9 billion of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits represents approximately 28% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. The Company had total liquidity sources, including cash and collateralized funding sources of $15.1 billion or approximately 117% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits as of December 31, 2023.

FHLB advances provide the banks with access to fixed-rate funds which are useful in mitigating interest rate risk and achieving an acceptable interest rate spread on fixed-rate loans or securities. FHLB advances to the banks totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022. See Note (11) &#8220;Federal Home Loan Bank Advances&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the terms of these advances. 

Notes payable balances represent the balances on a credit agreement (as amended, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with certain unaffiliated banks. The Credit Agreement consists of a $200.0 million term loan facility and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility was $171.3 million and there was no outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. See Note (13) &#8220;Other Borrowings&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of notes payable. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements of customer sweep accounts in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. These borrowings totaled $13.4 million and $17.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This funding category typically fluctuates based on customer preferences and daily liquidity needs of the banks, their customers and the banks&#8217; operating subsidiaries. See Note (13) &#8220;Other Borrowings&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these borrowings. 

The balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction (&#8220;Canadian Secured Borrowing&#8221;). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sells an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for cash payments pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (&#8220;Receivables Purchase Agreement&#8221;). See Note (13) &#8220;Other Borrowings&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these secured borrowings under this agreement. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the translated balance of the secured borrowings totaled $392.5 million and $309.7 million, respectively. 

Other borrowings at December 31, 2023 represent a fixed-rate promissory note (&#8220;Fixed-Rate Promissory Note&#8221;) issued by the Company in June 2017. Amendments to the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note since issuance increased the principal amount to $66.4 million, reduced the interest rate to 1.70%, and extended the maturity date to March 31, 2025. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note relates to and is secured by three office buildings owned by the Company. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $59.2 million and $61.3 million, respectively. See Note (13) &#8220;Other Borrowings&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these borrowings. 

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, subordinated notes totaled $437.9 million and $437.4 million, respectively. During 2019, the Company issued $300.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $296.7 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discount. The notes have a stated interest rate of 4.85% and mature in June 2029. During 2014, the Company issued $140.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $139.1 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discount. The notes have a stated interest rate of 5.00% and mature in June 2024. See Note (12) &#8220;Subordinated Notes&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion. 

The Company had $253.6 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the junior subordinated debentures issued to eleven trusts by the Company and equal the amount of the preferred and common securities issued by the trusts. See Note (14) &#8220;Junior Subordinated Debentures&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures. Starting in 2016, none of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company resulting in

$245.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, being included in the Company&#8217;s Tier 2 regulatory capital as of December 31, 2023. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity . Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $5.4 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $602.7 million from the December 31, 2022 total of $4.8 billion. The increase in 2023 was primarily a result of net income of $622.6 million, $33.5 million of stock-based compensation costs credited to surplus, $35.4 million in net unrealized gains from investment securities, net of tax, $24.7 million of net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net of tax, and $6.4 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax. These increases to total shareholders&#8217; equity were partially offset by common stock dividends of $97.7 million and preferred stock dividends of $28.0 million. See Note (23) &#8220;Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies that take into account risk attributable to balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory &#8212; and possibly discretionary &#8212; actions by regulators, that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, of which at least 4.5% must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 6.0% must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve also requires a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of greater than 4.0%. In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to consider the Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 

The following table summarizes the capital guidelines for bank holding companies as of December 31, 2023, as well as certain ratios relating to the Company&#8217;s equity and assets as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:

(1) Reflects the Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.50%. 

(2) Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as &#8220;N/A&#8221; in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, the Company&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31, 2023 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. 

As reflected in the table, each of the Company&#8217;s capital ratios at December 31, 2023, exceeded the well-capitalized ratios established by the Federal Reserve. Management is committed to maintaining the Company&#8217;s capital levels above the &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; levels established by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies. Refer to Note (19) &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on the capital positions of the banks. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity.

In January, April, July and October of 2023 and 2022, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share and $429.69 per share of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, respectively. 

The payment of common stock dividends is also subject to statutory restrictions and restrictions arising under the terms of the Company&#8217;s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities offerings units and under certain financial covenants in the Company&#8217;s revolving and term credit facilities. Under the terms of these separate revolving and term credit facilities, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on any equity interests, including its common stock and preferred stock, if such payments would cause the Company to be in default under its facilities or exceed a certain threshold. In January, April, July and October of 2023, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2022, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per common share. In January of 2024, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per common share. Taking into account the limitations on the payment of dividends, the final determination of timing, amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and will depend on the Company&#8217;s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors. 

In June 2022, the Company sold a total of 3,450,000 shares of its common stock through a public offering. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $285.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs. 

Banking laws impose restrictions upon the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company by the banks. Based on these laws, the banks could, subject to minimum capital requirements, declare dividends to the Company without obtaining regulatory approval in an amount not exceeding (a) undivided profits, and (b) the amount of net income reduced by dividends paid for the current and prior two years. 

Since the banks are required to maintain their capital at the well-capitalized level (due to the Company being a financial holding company), funds otherwise available as dividends from the banks are limited to the amount that would not reduce any of the banks&#8217; capital ratios below the well-capitalized level. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the subsidiaries paid $360.0 million, $52.0 million and $145.0 million, respectively, in dividends to the Company. As of December 31, 2023, subject to minimum capital requirements at the banks, approximately $941.2 million was available as dividends from the banks without prior regulatory approval and without compromising the banks&#8217; well-capitalized positions. 

Liquidity management at the banks involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost. Liquidity management is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by the Company&#8217;s senior management and each Bank&#8217;s asset/liability committee, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. The banks&#8217; principal sources of funds are deposits, short-term borrowings and capital contributions from the holding company. In addition, the banks are eligible to borrow under FHLB advances and at the FRB Discount Window, another source of liquidity. 

In accordance with the liquidity management noted above, deposit growth and increases in borrowings from various sources have resulted in accumulating liquidity assets in recent periods. In 2023, we managed our liquid assets to ensure that we have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks. 

Core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity for community banks due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with depositors and the security of deposit insurance provided by the FDIC. Core deposits are generally defined in the industry as total deposits less time deposits with balances greater than $100,000. Due to the affluent nature of many of the communities that the Company serves, management believes that many of its time deposits with balances in excess of $100,000 are also a stable source of funds. Currently, standard deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank, for each account ownership category. 

While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company&#8217;s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below:

(1) Brokered Deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program, as well as wealth management deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks and mature within less than one year. 

The Company&#8217;s banks routinely accept deposits from a variety of municipal entities. Typically, these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the banks had approximately $6.9 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, of securities collateralizing public deposits and other liquidity sources. Public deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits, however they provide the Company with a reliable, lower cost, short-term funding source than what is available through many other wholesale alternatives. 

Other than as discussed in this section, the Company is not aware of any known trends, commitments, events, regulatory recommendations or uncertainties that would have any material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s capital resources, operations or liquidity. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

The Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, that may require future cash payments. 

Contractual Obligations. Our significant contractual obligations with third parties primarily consist of deposit liabilities and other sources of funding for our businesses, including FHLB advances, subordinated debt, other debt borrowings and junior subordinated debentures. These debt obligations have fixed and determinable contractual repayment dates specific to each type of instrument. Deposit liabilities are primarily due on-demand, with certain time deposits due based on contractual maturities that may exceed one year. Repayment of debt obligations, including junior subordinated debentures, vary based on terms of the underlying debt instrument, with certain debt instruments requiring full repayment of the debt at the respective maturity date and other debt instruments requiring periodic partial repayment over the entire term of the debt instrument. Further information on these debt obligations is included in Notes (10) &#8220;Deposits&#8221; through (14) &#8220;Junior Subordinated Debentures&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

The Company enters into various leasing arrangements with contractual obligations to pay for use of specified assets over a specific period of time. These leased assets primarily related to certain banking facilities as well as specific signage related to sponsorships and other agreements, and certain automatic teller machines and other equipment. Payments under these obligations are primarily made on a monthly basis. Further information on these lease obligations is included in Note (16) &#8220;Lease Commitments&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

The Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations relate to certain contractual cash obligations for acquisition-related contingent costs, marketing obligations and services related to the construction of facilities, data processing and the outsourcing of certain operational activities. In 2023, the Company continued to significantly invest in technology, including enhancements to our customer&#8217;s digital experience, and it is subject to additional contractual purchase obligations in furtherance of these efforts. 

The Company also enters into derivative contracts under which the Company is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market rates as of the balance sheet date. Further information on derivative contracts is included in Note (21) &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Commitments. The following table presents a summary of the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of December 31, 2023. Further information on these commitments is included in Note (20) &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Our remaining commitment to fund community investments totaled $54.0 million, which includes future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low-income housing, support for small businesses, and historic tax credit projects that qualify for CRA purposes. These commitments are not included in the commitments table above, as the timing and amounts are based upon the financing arrangements provided in each project&#8217;s partnership or operating agreement and could change due to variances in the construction schedule, project revisions, or the cancellation of the project. 

Contingencies. The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. These agreements usually require certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. Investors have requested the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. Upon completion of its own investigation, the Company generally repurchases or provides indemnification on certain loans. Indemnification requests are generally received within two years subsequent to sale. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this recourse liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loans and current economic conditions. At December 31, 2023, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification was approximately $152,000 and was included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
