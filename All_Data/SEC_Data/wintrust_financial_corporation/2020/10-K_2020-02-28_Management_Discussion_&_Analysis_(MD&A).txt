Forward-looking information can be identified through the use of words such as &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;contemplate,&#8221; &#8220;possible,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements and information are not historical facts, are premised on many factors and assumptions, and represent only management&#8217;s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events. Similarly, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, which may include, but are not limited to, those listed below and the Risk Factors discussed under Item 1A on page 20 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the Company&#8217;s other filings with the SEC. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions. Such forward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to the Company&#8217;s future financial performance, the performance of its loan portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves and charge-offs, delinquency trends, growth plans, regulatory developments, securities that the Company may offer from time to time, and management&#8217;s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on financial condition and results of operations from expected developments or events, the Company&#8217;s business and growth strategies, including future acquisitions of banks, specialty finance or wealth management businesses, internal growth and plans to form additional de novo banks or branch offices.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS 

The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company&#8217;s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share and return on average tangible common equity. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company&#8217;s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company&#8217;s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently. 

Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company&#8217;s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company&#8217;s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability.

OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY 

2019 Highlights 

The Company recorded net income of $355.7 million for the year of 2019 compared to $343.2 million and $257.7 million for the years of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The results for 2019 demonstrate continued operating strengths including strong loan and deposit growth which, despite compression in net interest margin, resulted in higher net interest income, higher revenue from the wealth management and mortgage banking businesses and growth in the leasing business. 

The Company increased its loan portfolio from $23.8 billion at December 31, 2018 to $26.8 billion at December 31, 2019 . This increase was primarily due to the growth in the Company's commercial real estate portfolio, residential real estate portfolio and the premium finance receivables portfolios as well as its commercial banking initiative. Loan growth was also attributed to the acquisitions of SBC, Incorporated (&#8220;SBC&#8221;), STC Bancshares Corp. (&#8220;STC&#8221;) and Rush-Oak Corporation (&#8220;ROC&#8221;). The Company is focused on making new loans, including in the commercial and commercial real estate sector, where opportunities that meet our underwriting standards exist. For more information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, see &#8220;Analysis of Financial Condition &#8211; Interest Earning Assets&#8221; and Note 4 &#8220;Loans&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during 2019 , the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources. The Company had overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

The Company recorded net interest income of $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to $964.9 million and $832.1 million in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The higher level of net interest income recorded in 2019 compared to 2018 resulted primarily from a $3.7 billion increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 14 basis point decrease in the net interest margin in 2019 due to higher costs of deposits (see &#8220;Net Interest Margin&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 

Non-interest income totaled $407.2 million in 2019 , increasing $51.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2018 . The increase in non-interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in wealth management and mortgage banking revenues, higher operating lease income from growth in our leasing divisions, higher gains on investment securities, higher service charges on deposits, an increase on fees from customer interest rate swaps and positive adjustments from foreign currency remeasurement (see &#8220;Non-Interest Income&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 

Non-interest expense totaled $928.1 million in 2019 , increasing $102.0 million , or 12% , compared to 2018 . The increase compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to a $66.3 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, $9.3 million higher equipment expense, higher operating lease equipment depreciation, an increase in amortization of intangible assets due to certain other intangible assets recognized as a result of the acquisition of CDEC, and higher marketing expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was, specifically, attributable to a $43.8 million increase in salaries resulting from annual salary increases and larger staffing as the Company grew (including growth from acquisitions), a $13.0 million increase in commissions and incentive compensation primarily attributable to the Company's incentive compensation programs, and a $9.5 million increase in employee benefits due to higher payroll taxes, employee insurance and retirement savings plan costs. These increases were partially offset during the period by lower costs for consulting services and professional fees, data processing and FDIC insurance (see &#8220;Non-Interest Expense&#8221; section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 

As the Company continues to experience strong growth in its balance sheet, controlling operating expenses is a continued focus throughout the Company's various business units. Management monitors expense control from period to period throughout the Company and places an emphasis on the Company's net overhead ratio, which provides a measure of efficiency both on a consolidated basis and across business units. The Company's goal is to maintain a net overhead ratio below 1.50% on a consolidated basis. 

Economic Environment 

The economic environment in 2019 was characterized by compression in net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year, and continued competition as banks have experienced improvements in their financial condition allowing them to be more active in the lending market. The Company has employed certain strategies to manage net income in the current rate environment, including those discussed below. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Net Interest Income 

The Company has leveraged its internal loan pipeline and external growth opportunities to grow its earning assets base. The Company also continues its efforts to improve its funding mix. In 2019, the Company's net interest margin decreased to 3.45% (3.47% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) as compared to 3.59% (3.61% on a fully tax-equivalent basis) in 2018 primarily as a result of rising costs of deposits. As a result of the growth in earning assets, partially offset by reduced net interest margin, the Company increased net interest income by $90.0 million in 2019 compared to 2018. 

The Company has continued its practice of writing call options against certain U.S. Treasury and Agency securities to economically hedge the securities positions and receive fee income to compensate for net interest margin compression. In 2019, the Company recognized $3.7 million in fees on covered call options compared to $3.5 million in 2018. 

The Company utilizes &#8220;back to back&#8221; interest rate derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps, to receive floating rate interest payments related to customer loans. In these arrangements, the Company makes a floating rate loan to a borrower who prefers to pay a fixed rate. To accommodate the risk management strategy of certain qualified borrowers, the Company enters a swap with its borrower to effectively convert the borrower's variable rate loan to a fixed rate. However, in order to minimize the Company's exposure on these transactions and continue to receive a floating rate, the Company simultaneously executes an offsetting mirror-image swap with various third parties. 

Non-Interest Income 

The interest rate environment impacts the profitability and mix of the Company's mortgage banking business which generated revenues of $154.3 million in 2019 and $137.0 million in 2018, representing 11% and 10% of total net revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Mortgage banking revenue is primarily comprised of gains on sales of mortgage loans originated for new home purchases as well as mortgage refinancing. Mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"). Mortgage originations for sale totaled $4.5 billion and $4.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, approximately 52% of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases, while 48% of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages. In 2018, approximately 75% of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases, while 25% of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages. 

&#160; 

Non-Interest Expense 

Management believes expense management is important to enhance profitability amid the low interest rate environment and increased competition. Cost control and an efficient infrastructure should position the Company appropriately as it continues its growth strategy. Management continues to be disciplined in its approach to growth and plans to leverage the Company's existing expense infrastructure to expand its presence in existing and complimentary markets. Potentially impacting the cost control strategies discussed above, the Company anticipates increased costs resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate as well as continued investment in technology. 

Credit Quality 

The Company's credit quality metrics remained at historically favorable levels in 2019. The Company continues to actively address non-performing assets and remains disciplined in its approach to grow without sacrificing asset quality. 

In particular: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s 2019 provision for credit losses, totaled $53.9 million, compared to $34.8 million in 2018 and $30.0 million in 2017 . Net charge-offs increased to $49.5 million in 2019 (of which $35.9 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans), compared to $19.7 million in 2018 (of which $8.8 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans) and $15.0 million in 2017 (of which $5.3 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans). 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company's allowance for loan losses increased to $156.8 million at December 31, 2019 , reflecting an increase of $4.1 million, or 3%, when compared to 2018 . At December 31, 2019 , approximately $66.9 million, or 43%, of the allowance for loan losses was associated with commercial real estate loans and another $64.9 million, or 41%, was associated with commercial loans. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company has significant exposure to commercial real estate. At December 31, 2019 , $8.0 billion, or 30%, of our loan portfolio was commercial real estate, with approximately 86% located in our market area. The commercial real estate loan portfolio, excluding purchased credit impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans, was comprised of $1.2 billion related to land and construction,

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

$1.0 billion related to office buildings loans, $1.1 billion related to retail loans, $1.0 billion related to industrial use, $1.3 billion related to multi-family loans and $2.1 billion related to mixed use and other use types. In analyzing the commercial real estate market, the Company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data, in large part because the Company&#8217;s market area is diverse and covers many communities, each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the Company&#8217;s general market area. As such, the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other real estate loans made by the Company. The Company uses its multi-chartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had approximately $26.1 million of non-performing commercial real estate loans representing approximately 0.33% of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Total non-performing loans (loans on non-accrual status and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest) were $117.6 million (of which $26.1 million, or 22% , was related to commercial real estate) at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $4.3 million compared to December 31, 2018 . Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans were 0.44% at December 31, 2019 compared to 0.48% at December 31, 2018 . 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company&#8217;s other real estate owned decreased by $9.6 million, to $15.2 million during 2019 , from $24.8 million at December 31, 2018 . The decrease in other real estate owned is primarily a result of $14.5 million of OREO disposals and resolutions during 2019. The $15.2 million of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2019 was comprised of $13.3 million of commercial real estate property, $1.0 million of residential real estate property and $810,000 of residential real estate development property. 

##TABLE_END 

During 2019 , management continued its efforts to aggressively resolve problem loans through liquidation, rather than retention of loans or real estate acquired as collateral through the foreclosure process. Management believes these actions will serve the Company well in the future by providing some protection for the Company from further valuation deterioration and permitting Management to spend less time on resolution of problem loans and more time on growing the Company&#8217;s core business and the evaluation of other opportunities. 

Management continues to direct significant attention toward the prompt identification, management and resolution of problem loans. The Company has restructured certain loans by providing economic concessions to borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. At December 31, 2019 , approximately $63.8 million in loans had terms modified representing troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;), with $36.7 million of these TDRs continuing in accruing status. See Note 5, &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of TDRs. 

The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. The Company&#8217;s practice is generally not to retain long-term fixed rate mortgages on its balance sheet in order to mitigate interest rate risk, and consequently sells most of such mortgages into the secondary market. These agreements provide recourse to investors through certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. Investors request the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. An increase in requests for loss indemnification can negatively impact mortgage banking revenue as additional recourse expense. The liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was $2.4 million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 . 

Community Banking 

Through our community banking franchise, we provide banking and financial services primarily to individuals, small to mid-sized businesses, local governmental units and institutional clients residing primarily in the local areas we service. Profitability of this franchise is primarily driven by our net interest income and margin, our funding mix and related costs, the level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, the amount of mortgage banking revenue and our history of acquiring banking operations and establishing de novo banking locations. 

Net interest income and margin . The primary source of our revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities to fund those assets, including deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates, customer prepayment patterns, the mix of interest-earning assets and the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing deposits and borrowings. 

Funding mix and related costs. The most significant source of funding in community banking is core deposits, which are comprised of non-interest bearing deposits, non-brokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and domestic time deposits. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Our branch network is the principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Community banking profitability has been bolstered in recent years as the Company funded strong loan growth with a more desirable blend of funds. 

Level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned . The level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned can significantly impact our profitability as these loans and other real estate owned do not accrue any income, can be subject to charge-offs and write-downs due to deteriorating market conditions and generally result in additional legal and collections expenses. The Company's credit quality measures have remained at historically low levels in recent years. 

Mortgage banking revenue . Our community banking franchise is also influenced by the level of fees generated by the origination of residential mortgages and the sale of such mortgages into the secondary market by Wintrust Mortgage. The Company recognized an increase of $17.3 million in mortgage banking revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of higher origination volumes in 2019 and increased servicing fees. Mortgage originations for sale totaled $4.5 billion and $4.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Expansion of banking operations. Our historical financial performance has been affected by costs associated with growing market share in deposits and loans, establishing and acquiring banks, opening new branch facilities and building an experienced management team. Our financial performance generally reflects the improved profitability of our banking subsidiaries as they mature, offset by the costs of establishing and acquiring banks and opening new branch facilities. 

In determining the timing of the opening of additional branches of existing banks, and the acquisition of additional banks, we consider many factors, particularly our perceived ability to obtain an adequate return on our invested capital driven largely by the then existing cost of funds and lending margins, the general economic climate and the level of competition in a given market. See discussion of 2019 and 2018 acquisition activity in the &#8220;Recent Acquisition Transactions&#8221; section below. 

In addition to the factors considered above, before we engage in expansion through de novo branches we must first make a determination that the expansion fulfills our objective of enhancing shareholder value through potential future earnings growth and enhancement of the overall franchise value of the Company. Generally, we believe that, in normal market conditions, expansion through de novo growth is a better long-term investment than acquiring banks because the cost to bring a de novo location to profitability is generally substantially less than the premium paid for the acquisition of a healthy bank. Each opportunity to expand is unique from a cost and benefit perspective. Both FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions offer a unique opportunity for the Company to expand into new and existing markets in a non-traditional manner. Potential acquisitions are reviewed in a similar manner as a de novo branch opportunities, however, FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions have the ability to immediately enhance shareholder value. Factors including the valuation of our stock, other economic market conditions, the size and scope of the particular expansion opportunity and competitive landscape all influence the decision to expand via de novo growth or through acquisition. 

Specialty Finance 

Through our specialty finance segment, we offer financing of insurance premiums for businesses and individuals; lease financing and other direct leasing opportunities; accounts receivable financing, value-added, out-sourced administrative services; and other specialty finance businesses. 

Financing of Commercial Insurance Premiums 

The primary driver of profitability related to the financing of commercial insurance premiums is the net interest spread that FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit. The commercial insurance premium finance business is a competitive industry and yields on loans are influenced by the market rates offered by our competitors. The majority of loans originated by FIRST Insurance Funding are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. We fund these loans primarily through our deposits, the cost of which is influenced by competitors in the retail banking markets in our market area. 

Financing of Life Insurance Premiums 

The primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that Wintrust Life Finance can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit. Profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging information technology systems, maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size, each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment.

Wealth Management 

We offer a full range of wealth management services including trust and investment services, tax-deferred like-kind exchange services, asset management solutions, securities brokerage services, and 401(k) and retirement plan services through four separate subsidiaries (Wintrust Investments, CTC, Great Lakes Advisors and CDEC). 

The primary drivers of profitability of the wealth management business can be associated with the level of commission received related to the trading performed by the brokerage customers for their accounts and the amount of assets under management in which the unit receives a management fee for advisory, administrative and custodial services. As such, revenues are influenced by a rise or fall in the debt and equity markets and the resulting increase or decrease in the value of our client accounts on which our fees are based. The commissions received by the brokerage unit are not as directly influenced by the directionality of the debt and equity markets but rather the desire of our customers to engage in trading based on their particular situations and outlooks of the market or particular stocks and bonds. Profitability in the brokerage business is impacted by commissions which fluctuate over time. 

Financial Regulatory Reform 

Our business is heavily regulated by both federal and state agencies. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. While the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. 

The exact impact of the changing regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon legislative or regulatory changes to reform the financial regulatory framework and the actions of our competitors, customers, and other market participants. Legislative and regulatory changes could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices; requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements; limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities; imposing additional costs and compliance obligations on us; limiting fees we can charge for services; impacting the value of our assets; or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and our earnings&#8217; capabilities. We have already experienced significant increases in compliance related costs in recent years, and we are now subject to more stringent risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements than we were prior to the adoption of the U.S. Basel III Rules. We are also now subject to many mortgage-related rules promulgated by the CFPB that materially restructured the origination, services and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. We will continue to monitor the impact that the implementation of applicable rules, regulations and policies arising out of any legislative or regulatory changes may have on our organization. For further discussion of the laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiary banks, please refer to &#8220;Business-Supervision and Regulation.&#8221;

SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments, and as such have a greater possibility that changes in those estimates and assumptions could produce financial results that are materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required or elected to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event, and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates and assumptions. 

A summary of the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis section, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management views critical accounting policies to include the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses on lending-related commitments, loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. 

Allowance for Credit Losses, including the Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which are susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which relates to certain amounts the Company is committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed. See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and the section titled &#8220;Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality&#8221; in Item 7 for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. 

As of January 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL, which impacts the measurement of the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses (including the allowance for losses on lending-related commitments). CECL replaces the previous incurred loss methodology, which delays recognition until such loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses considering current economic condition and forecasts. Though other assets, including investment securities and other receivables, are considered in-scope of the standard and will require a measurement of the allowance for credit loss, the most significant impact of CECL remains within the Company&#8217;s loan portfolios and related lending commitments . 

Based upon the Company&#8217;s current composition of assets as well as current considerations of existing and expected future economic conditions, at adoption, the Company estimates an increase to the allowance for credit losses (consisting of the allowance for loan losses and allowance for losses on lending-related commitments prior to adoption) of approximately 25% to 40% related to its loan portfolios and related lending commitments. The estimated increase is partly related to additions to existing reserves for unfunded lending-related commitments due to the consideration under CECL of utilization by the Company's borrowers over the life of such commitments, as well as for acquired loans, which previously considered credit discounts. The Company estimates an insignificant impact at adoption of measuring an allowance for credit losses for the other in-scope assets noted above. The adjustment at adoption on January 1, 2020 is recognized as an adjustment to the balance sheet (retained earnings or the related

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

asset basis dependent upon whether the asset is purchased credit deteriorated from a prior acquisition). After adoption, adjustments to the allowance for credit losses will primarily be recorded as provision for credit losses on the Company&#8217;s income statement. The estimate of the allowance for credit losses is highly dependent upon considerations of current and expected economic conditions, which may result in earnings volatility across economic cycles. See Note 2, &#8220;Recent Accounting Pronouncements,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of the Company's implementation and adoption of CECL . 

Loans Acquired with Evidence of Credit Quality Deterioration since Origination 

Under accounting guidance applicable to loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the loans, using the effective-interest method. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. Changes in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition will either impact the accretable yield or result in a charge to the provision for credit losses. Subsequent decreases to expected principal cash flows will result in a charge to provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows will result in recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield for any remaining increase. All changes in expected interest cash flows, including the impact of prepayments, will result in reclassifications to/from the nonaccretable difference. 

Accounting guidance as discussed above applicable to loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination is eliminated under the requirements of CECL and replaced by specific guidance related to purchased credit deteriorated financial assets. Under CECL, the nonaccretable difference (credit discount) determined at acquisition on purchased credit deteriorated financial assets is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and added to the purchase price to determine the initial amortized cost of the financial asset. The accretable yield will be recognized in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the financial asset, using the effective-interest method. Changes in expected cash flows from the date of acquisition will only impact the allowance for credit losses (no impact to accretable yield). See Note 2, &#8220;Recent Accounting Pronouncements,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of the Company's implementation and adoption of CECL . 

Estimations of Fair Value 

A portion of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Condition, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These include the Company&#8217;s trading account securities, available-for-sale securities, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, derivatives, mortgage loans held-for-sale, certain loans held-for-investment and mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;). The determination of fair value is important for certain other assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, impaired loans, and other real estate owned that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates. 

Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently verified against observable market data where possible. Where observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on management&#8217;s judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income. See Note 22, &#8220;Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of fair value measurements. 

Impairment Testing of Goodwill 

The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill for each of its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. Using a qualitative approach, the Company reviews any recent events or circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These events and circumstances include the performance of the Company, the condition of the related industry in which the reporting unit operates and general economic environment and other factors. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not that there is impairment based on an evaluation of these events and circumstances, the Company may forgo the two-step quantitative approach. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Using a quantitative approach, the goodwill impairment analysis involves a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit was determined to have been higher than its fair value, the second step would have to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The second step allocates the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical purchase price allocation analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, the Company would record an impairment charge for the difference. Valuations are estimated in good faith by management through the use of publicly available valuations of comparable entities and discounted cash flow models using internal financial projections in the reporting unit&#8217;s business plan. 

Under both a qualitative and quantitative approach, the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Events and factors that may significantly affect the analysis include: a significant decline in the Company&#8217;s expected future cash flows, a substantial increase in the discount rate, a sustained, significant decline in the Company&#8217;s stock price and market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate. Other factors might include changing competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, revenue trends, cost structures, along with specific industry and market conditions. Adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of intangible assets and could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had three reporting units: Community Banking, Specialty Finance and Wealth Management. Based on the Company&#8217;s 2019 goodwill impairment testing, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units on their respective annual testing dates. See Note 8, &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing. 

Derivative Instruments 

The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk or market risk. The Company&#8217;s policy prohibits using derivatives for speculative purposes. 

Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as an accounting hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific asset or liability or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased. In order to qualify as an accounting hedge, a derivative must be designated as such at inception by management and meet certain criteria. Management must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item. To determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge, the Company must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of the hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. If the Company&#8217;s hedging strategy were to become ineffective, hedge accounting would no longer apply and the reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. See Note 21, &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of derivative accounting. 

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states, Canada and other jurisdictions where it conducts business. These laws are complex and subject to potentially different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Company&#8217;s tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management&#8217;s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. Management reviews its uncertain tax positions and recognition of the benefits of such positions on a regular basis. 

On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on a quarterly basis, if business events or circumstances warrant. Additionally, any enactment of new tax rates such as the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017 requires the Company to re-measure its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate, with such adjustments recognized in current year earnings.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion of Wintrust&#8217;s results of operations requires an understanding that a majority of the Company&#8217;s bank subsidiaries have been started as de novo banks since December 1991. Wintrust has a strategy of continuing to build its customer base and securing broad product penetration in each marketplace that it serves. The Company has expanded its banking franchise from three banks with five offices in 1994 to 15 banks with 187 offices at the end of 2019 . FIRST Insurance Funding and Wintrust Life Finance have matured into separate divisions that generated, on a national basis, $8.4 billion in total premium finance receivables in 2019 within the United States. FIFC Canada, acquired in 2012, originated $984.4 million in Canadian commercial premium finance receivables in 2019 . In addition, the wealth management companies have been building a team of experienced professionals who are located within a majority of the banks. 

Earnings Summary 

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 , totaled $355.7 million , or $6.03 per diluted common share, compared to $343.2 million , or $5.86 per diluted common share, in 2018 , and $257.7 million , or $4.40 per diluted common share, in 2017 . During 2019 , net income increased by $12.5 million and earnings per diluted common share increased by $0.17. During 2018, net income increased by $85.5 million and earnings per diluted common share increased by $1.46. Net income increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of an increase in net interest income driven by growth in earning assets, lower FDIC insurance costs and an increase in mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by compression of net interest margin, increased salary and employee benefits and higher amortization of other intangible assets. 

Net Interest Income 

The primary source of the Company&#8217;s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. 

Net interest income in 2019 totaled $1.1 billion , up from $964.9 million in 2018 and $832.1 million in 2017 , representing an increase of $90.0 million , or 9% , in 2019 and an increase of $132.8 million , or 16% , in 2018 . The table presented later in this section, titled &#8220;Changes in Interest Income and Expense,&#8221; presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and expense, by major category, attributable to changes in the volume of the balance sheet category and changes in the rate earned or paid with respect to that category of assets or liabilities for 2019 and 2018 . Average earning assets increased $3.7 billion , or 14% , in 2019 and $2.5 billion , or 10% , in 2018 . Loans are the most significant component of the earning asset base as they earn interest at a higher rate than the other earning assets. Average loans, excluding covered loans, increased $2.5 billion , or 11% , in 2019 and $2.0 billion , or 10% , in 2018 . Total average loans, excluding covered loans, as a percentage of total average earning assets were 82% , 84% and 85% in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The average yield on loans, excluding covered loans, was 4.93% in 2019 , 4.66% in 2018 and 4.19% in 2017 , reflecting an increase of 27 basis points in 2019 and an increase of 47 basis points in 2018 . The higher loan yields in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily a result of the rising interest rate environment during 2019. The average yield on liquidity management assets was 2.79% in 2019 , 2.78% in 2018 and 2.28% in 2017 , reflecting an increase of one basis point in 2019 and an increase of 50 basis points in 2018 . The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits, the largest component of the Company&#8217;s interest bearing liabilities, was 1.35% in 2019 , 0.95% in 2018 and 0.52% in 2017 , representing an increase of 40 basis points in 2019 and an increase of 43 basis points in 2018 . The higher level of interest bearing deposits rates in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to upward re-pricing of retail deposits as a result of rising interest rates. As a result of the above, net interest margin decreased to 3.45% ( 3.47 % on a fully tax-equivalent basis) in 2019 compared to 3.59% ( 3.61 % on a fully tax-equivalent basis) in 2018 . 

Net interest income and net interest margin were also affected by amortization of valuation adjustments to earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of acquired businesses. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are required to be recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. These valuation adjustments represent the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of assets and liabilities acquired. These adjustments are amortized into interest income and interest expense based upon the estimated remaining lives of the assets and liabilities acquired.

##TABLE_END

The changes in net interest income are created by changes in both interest rates and volumes. In the table above, volume variances are computed using the change in volume multiplied by the previous year&#8217;s rate. Rate variances are computed using the change in rate multiplied by the previous year&#8217;s volume. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows: 

Wealth management revenue is comprised of the trust and asset management revenue of the CTC and Great Lakes Advisors, the brokerage commissions, managed money fees and insurance product commissions at Wintrust Investments and fees from tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided by CDEC. 

Brokerage revenue is directly impacted by trading volumes. In 2019, brokerage revenue totaled $18.8 million , reflecting a decrease of $3.6 million , or 16% , compared to 2018. The decrease in brokerage revenue during 2019 compared to 2018 can be attributed to decreased customer trading activity. 

Trust and asset management revenue totaled $78.3 million in 2019, an increase of $9.7 million , or 14% , compared to 2018. Trust and asset management fees are based primarily on the market value of the assets under management or administration as well as volume of tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided during a period. Such revenue increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily as a result of fees earned from business generated by CDEC, which was acquired in December 2018, market appreciation related to managed money accounts with fees based on assets under management and higher asset levels from new customers and new financial advisors. 

Mortgage banking revenue totaled $154.3 million in 2019 compared to $137.0 million in 2018 reflecting an increase of $17.3 million , or 13 %, in 2019 , and an increase of $23.5 million, or 21%, in 2018. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. A main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. Mortgage originations for sale totaled $4.5 billion for the year ended 2019 compared to $4.0 billion for the same period of 2018. Mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of MSRs. The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. 

During 2019, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio increased as retained servicing rights led to capitalization of $44.9 million, partially offset by negative fair value adjustments of $14.8 million and a reduction in value due to payoffs and paydowns

of the existing portfolio. The Company purchased options and entered into interest rate swaps in 2019 to economically hedge a portion of the fair value changes recorded in earnings related to its MSRs portfolio. There were no such options outstanding as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company held 4 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $55.0 million for such purpose of economically hedging a portion of the fair value adjustment related to its mortgage servicing rights portfolio. See Note 6, &#8220;Mortgage Servicing Rights,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs.

Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $39.1 million in 2019, $36.4 million in 2018 and $34.5 million in 2017, reflecting an increase of 7% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. The increase in recent years is primarily a result of higher account analysis fees on deposit accounts which have increased as a result of the Company's commercial banking initiative as well as additional service charges on deposit accounts from acquired institutions. 

The Company recognized $3.5 million in net gains in 2019 compared to $2.9 million in net losses on investment securities in 2018 . The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2019 or 2018.

Fees from covered call option transactions totaled $3.7 million in 2019, versus $3.5 million in 2018 and $4.4 million in 2017. The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio by using fees generated from these options to compensate for net interest margin compression. These option transactions are designed to mitigate overall interest rate risk and to increase the total return associated with holding certain investment securities and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017, respectively. 

The Company recognized $158,000 of trading losses in 2019 compared to trading gains of $11,000 in 2018 and trading losses of $845,000 in 2017. Trading gains and losses recorded by the Company primarily result from fair value adjustments related to interest rate derivatives not designated as hedges. 

Operating lease income totaled $ 47.0 million in 2019 compared to $ 38.5 million in 2018. The increase annually is primarily related to growth in business from the Company's leasing divisions. 

Interest rate swap fee revenue totaled $13.1 million in 2019, $11.0 million in 2018 and $7.4 million in 2017. Swap fee revenues result from interest rate swap transactions related to both customer-based trades and the related matched trades with inter-bank dealer counterparties. The revenue recognized on this customer-based activity is sensitive to the pace of organic loan growth, the shape of the yield curve and the customers&#8217; expectations of interest rates. The fluctuations in swap fee revenue in 2019 primarily results from fluctuations in interest rate swap transactions related to both customer-based trades and the related matched trades with inter-bank dealer counterparties. 

Bank owned life insurance (&#8220;BOLI&#8221;) generated non-interest income of $4.9 million in 2019 compared to $5.0 million in 2018 . This income typically represents adjustments to the cash surrender value of BOLI policies and proceeds received from death benefits. The Company initially purchased BOLI to consolidate existing term life insurance contracts of executive officers and to mitigate the mortality risk associated with death benefits provided for in executive employment contracts and in connection with certain deferred compensation arrangements. The Company has also assumed additional BOLI policies as the result of the acquisition of certain banks. The cash surrender value of BOLI totaled $187.5 million at December 31, 2019 and $147.9 million at December 31, 2018 , and is included in other assets. 

Administrative services revenue generated by Tricom was $4.2 million in 2019, $4.6 million in 2018 and $4.2 million in 2017. This revenue comprises income from administrative services, such as data processing of payrolls, billing and cash management services, to temporary staffing service clients located throughout the United States. Tricom also earns interest and fee income from providing high-yielding, short-term accounts receivable financing to this same client base, which is included in the net interest income category. 

The Company realized gains of $35,000, $601,000 and $1.2 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing gains realized from the early pay-off of leases originated and managed by the Company's leasing division. 

Miscellaneous other non-interest income totaled $39.6 million in 2019 compared to $33.1 million in 2018 . Miscellaneous income includes loan servicing fees, income from other investments, service charges and other fees. The increase in miscellaneous other income for 2019 compared to 2018 resulted primarily from loan syndication fees.

Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows: 

Salaries and employee benefits is the largest component of non-interest expense, accounting for 59% of the total in 2019 compared to 58% in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , salaries and employee benefits totaled $546.4 million and increased $66.3 million , or 14 %, compared to 2018 . This increase can be attributed to a $43.8 million increase in salaries resulting from annual salary increases and larger staffing as the Company grows, including growth from the various acquisitions during the period. 

Equipment expense totaled $52.3 million in 2019 compared to $42.9 million in 2018 , reflecting an increase of 22% in 2019 . The increase in equipment expense in 2019 and 2018 was primarily related to increased software costs. Equipment expense includes furniture, equipment and computer software, depreciation and repairs and maintenance costs. 

Operating lease equipment expense totaled $35.8 million in 2019, $29.3 million in 2018 and $24.1 million in 2017. The increase in both years was primarily related to growth in business from the Company's leasing divisions. 

Occupancy expense for the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $64.3 million, $57.8 million and $52.9 million, respectively, reflecting increases of 11% in 2019 and 9% in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily the result of higher maintenance and repairs and lower rental income earned on owned properties. Occupancy expense includes depreciation on premises, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities and maintenance of premises, as well as net rent expense for leased premises. 

Data processing expenses totaled $27.8 million in 2019 compared to $35.0 million in 2018 , representing a decrease of 21% in 2019. The amount of data processing expenses incurred fluctuates based on the overall growth of loan and deposit accounts as well as additional expenses recorded related to bank acquisition transactions. 

Advertising and marketing expenses totaled $48.6 million for 2019 compared to $41.1 million for 2018 . Marketing costs are incurred to promote the Company&#8217;s brand, commercial banking capabilities, the Company&#8217;s MaxSafe &#174; suite of products, community-based products, to attract loans and deposits and to announce new branch openings as well as the expansion of the Company's non-bank businesses. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to expenses for community-related advertisements and

sponsorships. The level of marketing expenditures depends on the type of marketing programs utilized which are determined based on the market area, targeted audience, competition and various other factors. Management continues to utilize mass market media promotions as well as targeted marketing programs in certain market areas. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred increased advertising and marketing costs to increase Wintrust's name recognition associated with the overall goal of becoming recognized as &#8220;Chicago&#8217;s Bank&#8221; and &#8220;Wisconsin&#8217;s Bank.&#8221; 

Professional fees totaled $27.5 million in 2019, $32.3 million in 2018 and $27.8 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 related primarily to lower legal fees and consulting costs. Professional fees include legal, audit and tax fees, external loan review costs and regulatory exam assessments. 

FDIC insurance expense totaled $9.2 million in 2019 compared to $17.2 million in 2018 reflecting a decrease of 47% in 2019 . The decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 is related to assessment credits received by the FDIC. 

OREO expense was $3.6 million in 2019, $6.1 million in 2018 and $3.6 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily the result of lower negative valuation adjustments of OREO properties. OREO expenses include all costs associated with obtaining, maintaining and selling other real estate owned properties as well as valuation adjustments. 

Miscellaneous non-interest expense increased $21.6 million , or 32% , in 2019 compared to 2018 , partly as a result of higher telecommunication costs and higher travel-related expenses. Miscellaneous non-interest expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent banking charges, directors&#8217; fees, telephone and communication, travel and entertainment, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses, operating losses and lending origination costs that are not deferred. 

Income Taxes 

The Company recorded income tax expense of $124.4 million in 2019 compared to $117.0 million in 2018 and $132.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rates were 25.9% in 2019, 25.4% in 2018 and 33.9% in 2017. The lower effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 as compared to 2017 were primarily due to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, from 35% to 21% as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. Please refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion and analysis of the Company's tax position, including a reconciliation of the tax expense computed at the statutory tax rate to the Company's actual tax expense. 

Operating Segment Results 

As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. The Company&#8217;s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment's risk-weighted assets. 

The community banking segment&#8217;s net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $841.6 million as compared to $791.8 million for the same period in 2018 , an increase of $49.8 million , or 6% . The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to growth in earning assets, partially offset by lower net interest margin. The community banking segment's provision for credit losses totaled $47.9 million in 2019 compared to $28.6 million in 2018 . The provision for credit losses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a significant increase in loans during 2019 . Non-interest income for the community banking segment increased $36.0 million , or 15% , in 2019 when compared to 2018 . The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking revenue. The community banking segment&#8217;s net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $238.5 million , a decrease of $2.3 million , compared to net income of $240.8 million in 2018 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a $65.4 million increase in non-interest expense, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits within the community banking segment. 

The specialty finance segment&#8217;s net interest income totaled $161.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , compared to $137.0 million in the same period of 2018 , an increase of $24.7 million , or 18% . The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to growth in average loans and higher yields on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment's provision for credit losses totaled $6.0 million in 2019 compared to $6.2 million in 2018 . The specialty finance segment&#8217;s non-interest income totaled $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $65.9 million in 2018 .

##TABLE_END

The increase in non-interest income in 2019 is primarily a result of higher originations and increased balances related to the premium finance portfolio and growth in business from the Company's leasing division. For 2019 , our commercial premium finance operations, life insurance premium finance operations, leasing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 42%, 34%, 20% and 4%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business. Net income of the specialty finance segment totaled $89.4 million and $82.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $30.1 million for 2019 and $17.5 million for 2018 . Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $1.7 billion and $894.9 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $100.1 million for 2019 as compared to $91.9 million for 2018 . This increase is primarily due to growth in assets from new and existing customers and market appreciation. Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company as the number of brokers in its banks continues to increase. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment reported net income of $27.8 million for 2019 compared to $20.3 million for 2018 . 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Total assets were $36.6 billion at December 31, 2019 , representing an increase of $5.4 billion , or 17.2%, when compared to December 31, 2018 . Total funding, which includes deposits, all notes and advances, including secured borrowings and junior subordinated debentures, was $31.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and $27.3 billion at December 31, 2018 .

Total average earning assets increased $ 3.7 billion, or 14%, in 2019 . Average earning assets comprised 92% of average total assets in 2019 and 93% in 2018 . 

Mortgage loans held-for-sale. Average mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $308.6 million in 2019, compared to $332.9 million in 2018. By selling residential mortgage loans into the secondary market, the Company eliminates the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provides a source of non-interest revenue. 

Loans. Average total loans, net of unearned income, totaled $25.0 billion and increased $2.5 billion, or 11%, in 2019 . Average commercial loans totaled $8.1 billion in 2019 , and increased $833.4 million, or 12%, over the average balance in 2018 , while average commercial real estate loans totaled $7.3 billion in 2019 , increasing $670.5 million, or 10%, since 2018 . Combined, these categories comprised 62% of the average loan portfolio in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The growth realized in these categories for 2019 and 2018 is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts and various acquisitions during the period. 

Home equity loans averaged $526.9 million in 2019 , and decreased $75.4 million, or 13%, when compared to the average balance in 2018 . Unused commitments on home equity lines of credit totaled $800.6 million at December 31, 2019 and $807.9 million at December 31, 2018 . The Company has been actively managing its home equity portfolio to ensure that diligent pricing, appraisal and other underwriting activities continue to exist. 

Residential real estate loans averaged $1.0 billion in 2019 , and increased $193.2 million, or 23%, from the average balance in 2018 . 

Average premium finance receivables totaled $7.9 billion in 2019 , and accounted for 32% of the Company&#8217;s average total loans. In 2019 , average premium finance receivables increased $885.0 million, or 13%, compared to 2018 . The increase during 2019 was the result of continued originations within the portfolio due to effective marketing and customer servicing. Approximately $9.4 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in 2019 compared to approximately $7.9 billion in 2018 . 

Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals as well as high-yielding short-term accounts receivable financing to clients in the temporary staffing industry located throughout the United States. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral. Additionally, short-term accounts receivable financing may also involve greater credit risks than generally associated with the loan portfolios of more traditional community banks depending on the marketability of the collateral. 

Covered loans represented loans acquired through the nine FDIC-assisted transactions, all of which occurred prior to 2013. These loans were subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The FDIC agreed to reimburse the Company for 80% of losses incurred on the purchased loans, foreclosed real estate, and certain other assets. On October 16, 2017, the Company entered into agreements with the FDIC that terminated all existing loss share agreements with the FDIC. The Company will be solely responsible for all future charge-offs, recoveries, gains, losses and expenses related to the previously covered assets as the FDIC will no longer share in those amounts. See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a discussion of these acquisitions, including the aggregation of these loans by risk characteristics when determining the initial and subsequent fair value. 

Liquidity Management Assets. Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest-bearing deposits with banks. Average liquidity management assets accounted for 17% and 15% of total average earning assets in 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Average liquidity management assets increased $1.2 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 . The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management&#8217;s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. 

Other earning assets. Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. In the normal course of business, Wintrust Investments activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various securities transactions. Wintrust Investments customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, Wintrust Investments, under an agreement with the out-sourced securities firm, extends credit to its customer, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in customer&#8217;s accounts. In connection with these activities, Wintrust Investments executes and the out-sourced firm clears customer transactions relating to the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. Such transactions may expose Wintrust Investments to off-balance-sheet risk, particularly in volatile trading markets, in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur. In the event a customer fails to satisfy its obligations, Wintrust Investments under an agreement with the out-sourced securities firm, may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer's obligations. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers&#8217; activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

regulatory and internal guidelines. Wintrust Investments monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Our allowance for loan losses in our commercial loan portfolio is $64.9 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $67.8 million as of December 31, 2018 . Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. The most significant fluctuations in the commercial portfolio allowance for loan losses from 2018 to 2019 occurred as a result of resolving a $7.5 million impaired relationship during the third quarter of 2019 that was previously fully reserved for. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the allowance as a result of growth in the commercial portfolio and higher required specific reserves on impaired loans within the portfolio. 

Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, 86.3% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of December 31, 2019 . We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2019 , our allowance for loan losses related to this portfolio is $66.9 million compared to $60.3 million as of December 31, 2018 . 

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. Amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within 21 days. During 2019 , our mortgage warehouse lines increased to $292.8 million as of December 31, 2019 from $144.2 million as of December 31, 2018 . 

Home equity loans. Our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated by each of our banks in their local markets where we have a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. Our banks monitor and manage these loans, and we conduct an automated review of all home equity loans and lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects current credit performance for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining, or where there are events that may influence repayment, such as tax liens or judgments. Our banks use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. 

The rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors, including appraisals and valuation due diligence, in order to reflect inherent risk, and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests. In a limited number of cases, we issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis. It is not our practice to advance more than 85% of the appraised value of the underlying asset, which ratio we refer to as the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio, and a majority of the credit we previously extended, when issued, had an LTV ratio of less than 80%. Our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market. 

Residential real estate. Our residential real estate portfolio predominantly includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers. As of December 31, 2019 , our residential loan portfolio totaled $1.4 billion , or 5% of our total outstanding loans. 

Our adjustable rate mortgages relate to properties located principally in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin or vacation homes owned by local residents. These adjustable rate mortgages are often non-agency conforming. Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio. However, this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2019 , $13.8 million of our residential real estate mortgages, or 1.0% of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual, $5.8 million were 90 or more days past due and still accruing (0.4%), $21.1 million were 30 to 89 days past due ( 1.5% ) and $1.3 billion were current ( 97.1% ). We believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of our borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. 

While we generally do not originate loans for our own portfolio with long-term fixed rates due to interest rate risk considerations, we can accommodate customer requests for fixed rate loans by originating such loans and then selling them into the secondary market, for which we receive fee income. We may also selectively retain certain of these loans within the banks&#8217; own portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. A portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained. The amount of loans serviced for others as of

December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $8.2 billion and $6.5 billion , respectively. All other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights. 

The Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing,&#8221; this repurchase option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the repurchase option. These loans are reported as loans held-for-investment, part of the residential real estate portfolio, with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. Rebooked GNMA loans held-for-investment amounted to $123.1 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $82.5 million at December 31, 2018. 

It is not our current practice to underwrite, and we have no plans to underwrite, subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. As of December 31, 2019 , approximately $1.0 million of our mortgage loans consist of interest-only loans. 

Premium finance receivables &#8212; commercial. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $8.3 billion in commercial insurance premium finance receivables during 2019 as compared to approximately $6.8 billion in 2018 . FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada make loans to businesses to finance the insurance premiums they pay on their commercial insurance policies. The loans are originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers&#8217; purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. 

This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. Because of the indirect nature of this lending through third party agents and brokers and because the borrowers are located nationwide and in Canada, this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud. The majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. 

Premium finance receivables &#8212; life insurance. Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $1.1 billion in life insurance premium finance receivables in 2019 as compared to $1.0 billion in 2018 . The Company continues to experience a high level of competition and pricing pressure within the current market. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, Wintrust Life Finance may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position. 

Consumer and other. Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals as well as high yielding short-term accounts receivable financing to clients in the temporary staffing industry located throughout the United States. The banks originate consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to their customers. 

Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral. Additionally, short-term accounts receivable financing may also involve greater credit risks than generally associated with the loan portfolios of more traditional community banks depending on the marketability of the collateral. 

Foreign. The Company had approximately $456.4 million of loans to businesses with operations in foreign countries as of December 31, 2019 compared to $337.1 million at December 31, 2018 . This balance as of December 31, 2019 consists of loans originated by FIFC Canada.

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets 

Our ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which our credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis to determine each loan&#8217;s credit risk rating on a scale of 1 through 10 with higher scores indicating higher risk. The credit risk rating structure used is shown below:

Each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including, a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. A third party loan review firm independently reviews a significant portion of the loan portfolio at each of the Company&#8217;s subsidiary banks to evaluate the appropriateness of the management-assigned credit risk ratings. These ratings are subject to further review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago and the OCC, and are also reviewed by our loan review and internal audit staff. 

The Company&#8217;s problem loan reporting system includes all loans with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible or an impairment reserve may be established. The Company&#8217;s impairment analysis utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real-estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company&#8217;s Real Estate Services Group to determine if 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. An appraisal is ordered at least once a year for these loans, or more often if market conditions dictate. In the event that the underlying value of the collateral cannot be easily determined, a detailed valuation methodology is prepared by the Managed Asset Division. A summary of this analysis is provided to the directors&#8217; loan committee of the bank which originated the credit for approval of a charge-off, if necessary. 

Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. In the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process, the Company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction and/or a pledge of additional collateral and/or additional guarantees. In the event that these options are not available, the loan may be subject to a downgrade of the credit risk rating. If we determine that a loan amount, or portion thereof, is uncollectible the loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Managed Asset Division undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. 

The Company&#8217;s approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the credit-risk rating process. A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for TDR classification. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 

TDRs, which are by definition considered impaired loans, are reviewed at the time of modification and on a quarterly basis to determine if a specific reserve is needed. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve. 

For non-TDR loans, if based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is considered impaired and a specific impairment reserve analysis is performed and, if necessary, a specific reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.

PCI loans are excluded from non-performing loans as they continue to earn interest income from the related accretable yield, independent of performance with contractual terms of the loan. See Note 5, &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of non-performing loans and the loan aging during the respective periods.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

The allowance for loan losses represents management&#8217;s estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable loan losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan, as described below under &#8220;How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in this Item 7. This process is subject to review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago and the OCC. 

The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan and covered loan losses and the allowance for losses on lending-related commitments by major loan type and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans for the past five fiscal years:

##TABLE_END

Management determined that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at December 31, 2019 , and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses the levels of total nonperforming loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations, current geographic risks and overall levels of net charge-offs. Historical trending of both the Company&#8217;s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START (1) 

Includes $742,000 of allowance for covered loan losses reclassified as a result of the termination of all existing loss share agreements with the FDIC during the fourth quarter of 2017. 

##TABLE_END 

The allowance for credit losses, excluding the allowance for covered loan losses, is comprised of an allowance for loan losses, which is determined with respect to loans that we have originated, and an allowance for lending-related commitments. Our allowance for lending-related commitments is determined with respect to funds that we have committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed and is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $1.6 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to $1.4 million as of December 31, 2018 .

Additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs represent the amount of loans that have been determined to be uncollectible during a given period, and are deducted from the allowance for loan losses, and recoveries represent the amount of collections received from loans that had previously been charged off, and are credited to the allowance for loan losses. See Note 5, &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for loan losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio, excluding covered loans. 

How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for loan losses includes an element for estimated probable but undetected losses and for imprecision in the credit risk models used to calculate the allowance. If the loan is impaired, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of calculating our specific impairment reserves as part of the Problem Loan Reporting system review. A general reserve is separately determined for loans not considered impaired. See Note 5, &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the specific impairment reserve and general reserve as it relates to the allowance for credit losses for each loan category and the total loan portfolio, excluding covered loans. 

Specific Impairment Reserves 

Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan (impaired loan). If a loan is impaired, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific impairment reserve. 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $120.0 million of impaired loans with $62.9 million of this balance requiring $12.3 million of specific impairment reserves. At December 31, 2018 , the Company had $127.3 million of impaired loans with $60.2 million of this balance requiring $11.4 million of specific impairment reserves. The most significant fluctuations in the recorded investment of impaired loans with specific impairment from 2018 to 2019 occurred within the franchise portfolio. The recorded investment decreased as a result of an impaired relationship being charged-off during 2019. 

See Note 5, &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of impaired loans and the related specific impairment reserve. 

General Reserves 

For loans with a credit risk rating of 1 through 7 that are not considered impaired loans, reserves are established based on the type of loan collateral, if any, and the assigned credit risk rating. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on the average historical loss experience over a nine-year period, and consideration of current environmental factors and economic trends, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. 

We determine this component of the allowance for loan losses by classifying each loan into (i) categories based on the type of collateral that secures the loan (if any), and (ii) one of ten categories based on the credit risk rating of the loan, as described above under &#8220;Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets&#8221; in this Item 7. Each combination of collateral and credit risk rating is then assigned a specific loss factor that incorporates the following factors: 

&#160;

##TABLE_END 

In 2019, the Company modified its historical loss experience analysis by incorporating nine-year average loss rate assumptions for its historical loss experience to capture an extended credit cycle. The current nine-year average loss rate assumption analysis is computed for each of the Company&#8217;s collateral codes. The historical loss experience is combined with the specific loss factor for each combination of collateral and credit risk rating which is then applied to each individual loan balance to determine an appropriate general reserve. The historical loss rates are updated on a quarterly basis and are driven by the performance of the portfolio and any changes to the specific loss factors are driven by management judgment and analysis of the factors described above. The Company also analyzes the three-, four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight-year average historical loss rates on a quarterly basis as a comparison. 

Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loans 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for loan losses for residential real estate and home equity loans differs slightly from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans. The same credit risk rating system, Problem Loan Reporting system, collateral coding methodology and loss factor assignment are used. The only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans. 

The home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current FICO scores of the borrowers, line availability, recent line usage, an approaching maturity and the aging status of the loan. Certain of these factors, or combination of these factors, may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be downgraded. Similar to commercial and commercial real estate loans, once a home equity loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is downgraded to a 6 through 9, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division reviews and advises the subsidiary banks as to collateral valuations and as to the ultimate resolution of the credits that deteriorate to a non-accrual status to minimize losses. 

Residential real estate loans that are downgraded to a credit risk rating of 6 through 9 also enter the problem loan reporting system and have the underlying collateral evaluated by the Managed Assets Division. 

Premium Finance Receivables 

The determination of the appropriate allowance for loan losses for premium finance receivables is based on the assigned credit risk rating of loans in the portfolio. Loss factors are assigned to each risk rating in order to calculate an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for loan losses for these categories is entirely a general reserve. 

Methodology in Assessing Impairment and Charge-off Amounts 

In determining the amount of impairment or charge-offs associated with collateral dependent loans, the Company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs to arrive at a net appraised value. We obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisal firms. Types of appraisal valuations include &#8220;as-is,&#8221; &#8220;as-complete,&#8221; &#8220;as-stabilized,&#8221; bulk, fair market, liquidation and &#8220;retail sellout&#8221; values. 

In many cases, the Company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type. If the Company receives offers or indications of interest, we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral. Additionally, the Company takes into account the strength of any guarantees and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate charge-off or reserve associated with any impaired loans. Accordingly, the Company may charge-off a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value. Alternatively, the Company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the Company has a guarantee from a borrower that the Company believes has realizable value. In evaluating the strength of any guarantee, the Company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor, the guarantor&#8217;s reputation, and the guarantor&#8217;s willingness and desire to work with the Company. The Company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant. 

##TABLE_START &#160;

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

In circumstances where the Company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest, the Company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately 90 days. To the extent that the realtors&#8217; indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation, the Company may take a charge-off on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation. 

The Company may also charge-off a loan below the net appraised valuation if the Company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, the Company may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full. 

In other cases, the Company may allow the borrower to conduct a &#8220;short sale,&#8221; which is a sale where the Company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan. Many times, it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price. To the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal, we may take a charge-off beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated. 

Other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower and/or property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral. 

Having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan, the Company arrives at a charge-off amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for loan losses. In summary, for collateral dependent loans, appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value. Estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value to arrive at the net appraised value. Although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for charge-offs on collateral dependent loans, alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates. As a result, we may utilize values obtained through these alternative sources, which include purchase and sale agreements, legitimate indications of interest, negotiated short sales, realtor price opinions, sale of the note or support from guarantors, as the basis for charge-offs. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. In addition, if an appraisal is not deemed current, a discount to appraised value may be utilized. Any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division. 

TDRs 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $63.8 million in loans classified as TDRs. The $63.8 million in TDRs represents 255 credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. The balance decreased from $66.1 million representing 134 credits at December 31, 2018 . 

Concessions were granted on a case-by-case basis working with these borrowers to find modified terms that would assist them in retaining their businesses or their homes and attempt to keep these loans in an accruing status for the Company. Typical concessions include reduction of the interest rate on the loan to a rate considered lower than market and other modification of terms including forgiveness of a portion of the loan balance, extension of the maturity date, and/or modifications from principal and interest payments to interest-only payments for a certain period. See Note 5, &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans,&#8221; of Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the effectiveness of these modifications in keeping the modified loans current based upon contractual terms. 

Subsequent to its restructuring, any TDR that becomes nonaccrual or more than 90 days past-due and still accruing interest will be included in the Company&#8217;s nonperforming loans. Each TDR was reviewed for impairment at December 31, 2019 and approximately $5.7 million of impairment was present and appropriately reserved for through the Company&#8217;s normal reserving methodology in the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. Additionally, the Company was committed to lend additional funds to borrowers totaling $0.9 million at December 31, 2018 under the contractual terms related to TDRs. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers at December 31, 2019.

Loan was previously classified as a TDR and subsequently performed in compliance with the loan&#8217;s modified terms for a period of six months (including over a calendar year-end) at a modified interest rate which represented a market rate at the time of restructuring. Per our TDR policy, the TDR classification is removed.

Potential Problem Loans 

Management believes that any loan where there are serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms should be identified as a non-performing loan and should be included in the disclosure of &#8220;Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets.&#8221; Accordingly, at the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has no potential problem loans as defined by SEC regulations. 

Loan Concentrations 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. The Company had no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2019 , except for loans included in the specialty finance operating segment, which are diversified throughout the United States and Canada. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. The Company employs extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our borrowers. The tables below present a summary of other real estate owned and shows the activity for the respective periods and the balance for each property type:

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC, trust and asset management customers of the Company and brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (&#8220;wealth management deposits&#8221; in the table above). Wealth management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks.

Various acquisitions, are partially responsible for the deposit fluctuations from 2018 to 2019. These acquisitions are discussed in Note 7, &#8220;Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions.&#8221; The Company's continued overall growth during 2019 and 2018 also contributed to these deposit fluctuations. 

Other Funding Sources. Although deposits are the Company&#8217;s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include short-term borrowings, notes payable, FHLB advances, subordinated debt, secured borrowings and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources. 

The following table sets forth, by category, the composition of the average balances of other funding sources for the periods presented:

Notes payable balances represent the balances on a $200.0 million loan agreement (&#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with unaffiliated banks consisting of a $50.0 million revolving credit facility (&#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) and a $150.0 million term facility (&#8220;Term Facility&#8221;). Both the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Facility are available for corporate purposes such as to provide capital

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

##TABLE_END

to fund continued growth at existing bank subsidiaries, possible future acquisitions and for other general corporate matters. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a balance under the Term Facility of $123.1 million . The Company was contractually required to borrow the entire amount of the Term Facility on September 18, 2018 and all such borrowings must be repaid by September 18, 2023. During 2019, the Company borrowed $35.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and paid-off such amount prior to December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding balance on the $50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the establishment of this loan agreement in 2018, all outstanding notes payable under a separate $150.0 million loan agreement with unaffiliated banks dated December 15, 2014 (as subsequently amended, the &#8220;Prior Credit Agreement&#8221;) were paid in full. The Prior Credit Agreement consisted of a term facility with an original outstanding balance of $75.0 million and a $75.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company had a balance under the term facility of the Prior Credit Agreement of $41.2 million at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, no balance was outstanding under the revolving credit facility of the Prior Credit Agreement . 

FHLB advances provide the banks with access to fixed rate funds which are useful in mitigating interest rate risk and achieving an acceptable interest rate spread on fixed rate loans or securities. FHLB advances to the banks totaled $674.9 million at December 31, 2019 and $426.3 million at December 31, 2018 . See Note 11, &#8220;Federal Home Loan Bank Advances,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of these advances. 

The average balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction (&#8220;Canadian Secured Borrowing&#8221;). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, in December 2014, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sold an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for a cash payment of approximately C$150 million pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (&#8220;Receivables Purchase Agreement&#8221;). The Receivables Purchase Agreement was amended in December 2015, effectively extending the maturity date from December 15, 2015 to December 15, 2017. Additionally, at that time, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$10 million , which increased the total payments to C$160 million . The Receivables Purchase Agreement was again amended in December 2017, effectively extending the maturity date from December 15, 2017 to December 16, 2019. Additionally, at that time, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$10 million , which increased the total payments to C$170 million . In June 2018, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$20 million , which increased the total payments to C$190 million . The Receivables Purchase Agreement was again amended in February 2019, effectively extending the maturity date from December 16, 2019 to December 15, 2020. Additionally, in February 2019, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$20 million , which increased the total payments to C$210 million . In May 2019, the unrelated third party paid an additional C$70 million , which increased the total payments to C$280 million . These transactions were not considered sales of receivables and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the unrelated third party, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and translated to the Company&#8217;s reporting currency as of the respective date. At December 31, 2019, the translated balance of the Canadian Secured Borrowing totaled $215.5 million with an interest rate of 2.729% . The remaining $12.7 million within secured borrowings at December 31, 2018 represents other sold interests in certain loans by the Company that were not considered sales and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the various unrelated third parties. 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, subordinated notes totaled $436.1 million and $139.2 million, respectively. During 2019, the Company issued $300.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $296.7 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discount. The notes have a stated interest rate of 4.85% and mature in June 2029. During 2014, the Company issued $140.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $139.1 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discount. The notes have a stated interest rate of 5.00% and mature in June 2024. 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased. These borrowings totaled $20.5 million and $50.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Securities sold under repurchase agreements represent sweep accounts for certain customers in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks as well as short-term borrowings from banks and brokers. This funding category typically fluctuates based on customer preferences and daily liquidity needs of the banks, their customers and the banks&#8217; operating subsidiaries. See Note 13, &#8220;Other Borrowings,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these borrowings. 

The Company has $253.6 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the junior subordinated debentures issued to eleven trusts by the Company and equal the amount of the preferred and common securities issued by the trusts. See Note 14, &#8220;Junior Subordinated Debentures,&#8221; of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures. Starting in 2016, none of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company resulting in $245.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, being included in the Company's Tier 2 regulatory capital.

Other borrowings at December 31, 2019 include a fixed-rate promissory note issued by the Company in June 2017 (&#8220;Fixed-Rate Promissory Note&#8221;) related to and secured by two office buildings owned by the Company. At December 31, 2019 , the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $46.4 million . Under the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note, the Company will make monthly principal payments and pay interest at a fixed rate of 3.36% until maturity on June 30, 2022 . Additionally, at December 31, 2017, other borrowings included non-recourse notes related to certain capital leases totaled $151,000. See Note 13, &#8220;Other Borrowings,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these borrowings. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity . Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $3.7 billion at December 31, 2019 , an increase of $423.7 million from the December 31, 2018 total of $3.3 billion . The increase in 2019 was primarily a result of net income of $355.7 million , $71.8 million from the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock related to the acquisition of STC and SBC, $57.3 million in net unrealized gains from investment securities, net of tax, $11.3 million credited to surplus for stock-based compensation costs, $9.4 million from the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to various stock compensation plans, net of treasury shares, and $5.9 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax, partially offset by common stock dividends of $56.9 million and preferred stock dividends of $8.2 million, and $21.0 million of net unrealized losses on cash flow hedges, net of tax. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies that take into account risk attributable to balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory &#8212; and possibly discretionary &#8212; actions by regulators, that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, of which at least 4.50% must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 6.0% must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve also requires a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%. In addition the Federal Reserve continues to consider the Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 

The following table summarizes the capital guidelines for bank holding companies as of December 31, 2019, as well as certain ratios relating to the Company&#8217;s equity and assets as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 :

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) 

Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as &#8220;N/A&#8221; in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, the Company&#8217;s capital ratios as of December 31, 2019 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. 

##TABLE_END 

As reflected in the table, each of the Company&#8217;s capital ratios at December 31, 2019 , exceeded the well-capitalized ratios established by the Federal Reserve. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the capital positions of the banks. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes 12, 13, 14 and 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on the Company&#8217;s subordinated notes,

other borrowings, junior subordinated debentures and shareholders&#8217; equity, respectively. Management is committed to maintaining the Company&#8217;s capital levels above the &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; levels established by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies. 

In June 2015, the Company issued and sold 5,000,000 shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25 per share for $125.0 million in a public offering. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears when, as and if declared by the Board at a rate of 6.50% per annum on the original liquidation preference of $25 per share from the original issuance date to, but excluding, July 15, 2025. From (and including) July 15, 2025, dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly in arrears, when, as and if declared by the Board, at a floating rate equal to the then-applicable three-month LIBOR (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) plus a spread of 4.06% per annum. The dividend rate of such floating rate dividends will be reset quarterly. The Company received proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and related costs, of approximately $120.8 million from the issuance, which were intended to be used for general corporate purposes. The Series D Preferred Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol &#8220;WTFCM.&#8221; 

The Series C Preferred Stock was convertible into common stock at the option of the holder subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In 2016, 30 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock were converted at the option of the respective holders into 729 shares of the Company's common stock. In 2015, 180 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock were converted at the option of the respective holders into 4,374 shares of the Company's common stock. On April 25, 2017, 2,073 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock were converted at the option of the respective holder into 51,244 shares of the Company's common stock. On April 27, 2017, the Company caused a mandatory conversion of its remaining 124,184 shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 3,069,828 shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion rate of 24.72 shares of common stock per share of Series C Preferred Stock. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares for an amount considered insignificant. 

The Board approved the first semi-annual dividend on the Company&#8217;s common stock in January 2000 and continued to approve semi-annual dividends until quarterly dividends were approved starting in 2014. The payment of dividends is also subject to statutory restrictions and restrictions arising under the terms of the Company's Series D Preferred Stock, the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities offerings units and under certain financial covenants in the Company&#8217;s revolving and term facilities. Under the terms of these separate facilities entered into on September 18, 2018, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on any equity interests, including its common stock and preferred stock, if such payments would cause the Company to be in default under its facilities or exceed a certain threshold. In January, April, July and October of 2019, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2018, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share. In January of 2020, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per common share. Taking into account the limitations on the payment of dividends, the final determination of timing, amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and will depend on the Company&#8217;s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors. 

Banking laws impose restrictions upon the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company by the banks. Based on these laws, the banks could, subject to minimum capital requirements, declare dividends to the Company without obtaining regulatory approval in an amount not exceeding (a) undivided profits, and (b) the amount of net income reduced by dividends paid for the current and prior two years. 

Since the banks are required to maintain their capital at the well-capitalized level (due to the Company being a financial holding company), funds otherwise available as dividends from the banks are limited to the amount that would not reduce any of the banks&#8217; capital ratios below the well-capitalized level. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the subsidiaries paid dividends to Wintrust totaling $139.0 million , $111.0 million , and $122.0 million , respectively. At January 1, 2020, subject to minimum capital requirements at the banks, approximately $542.0 million , excluding the effect of the CECL transition entry, was available as dividends from the banks without prior regulatory approval and without compromising the banks&#8217; well-capitalized positions. 

Liquidity management at the banks involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost. Liquidity management is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by the Company&#8217;s senior management and each Bank&#8217;s asset/liability committee, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. The banks&#8217; principal sources of funds are deposits, short-term borrowings and capital contributions from the holding company. In addition, the banks are eligible to borrow under FHLB advances and certain banks are eligible to borrow at the FRB Discount Window, another source of liquidity. 

Core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity for community banks due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with depositors and the security of deposit insurance provided by the FDIC. Core deposits are generally defined in the industry as total deposits less time deposits with balances greater than $100,000. Due to the affluent nature of many of the communities that the Company serves, management believes that many of its time deposits with balances in excess of $100,000

&#160;

are also a stable source of funds. Currently, standard deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank, for each account ownership category. 

While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company&#8217;s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below:

Brokered Deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program, as well as wealth management deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks. 

##TABLE_END 

The banks routinely accept deposits from a variety of municipal entities. Typically, these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the banks had approximately $1.7 billion of securities collateralizing public deposits and other short-term borrowings. Public deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits, however they provide the Company with a reliable, lower cost, short-term funding source than what is available through many other wholesale alternatives. 

Other than as discussed in this section, the Company is not aware of any known trends, commitments, events, regulatory recommendations or uncertainties that would have any material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s capital resources, operations or liquidity. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Our remaining commitment to fund community investments totaled $ 29.3 million, which includes future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low-income housing, support for small businesses, and historic tax credit projects that qualify for CRA purposes. These commitments are not included in the commitments table above, as the timing and amounts are based upon the financing arrangements provided in each project&#8217;s partnership or operating agreement and could change due to variances in the construction schedule, project revisions, or the cancellation of the project. 

Contingencies. The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. These agreements usually require certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. Investors have requested the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. Upon completion of its own investigation, the Company generally repurchases or provides indemnification on certain loans. Indemnification requests are generally received within two years subsequent to sale. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this recourse liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loans and current economic conditions. At December 31, 2019 , the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification was $2.4 million and was included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
