 Item 1A: Risk Factors 

The following constitute material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 . 

The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, employees and third-party service providers, and the adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted us and many of our customers, and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses in our geographic area as well as the overall domestic and global economy. U.S. federal, state and foreign governments have taken actions to address the pandemic, including travel bans, school and business closures and &#8220;shelter in place&#8221; orders. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in business valuations, disruption of global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. These changes may have a significant adverse effect on the markets in which we conduct our business, the demand for our products and services, and our ability to operate in the normal course. 

We have increased our allowance for loan losses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic could cause us to recognize heightened credit losses in our loan portfolio and additional increases in our allowance for loan losses. Certain portions of our lending portfolio are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, we could experience additional draws on lines of credit, downward pressure on deposits, and increased loan delinquencies. The effects of COVID-19 may impair the value of collateral securing our loans, especially commercial and residential real estate loans. Further, a significantly larger amount of delinquent mortgage loans may result in us having to repurchase or substitute loans that we have sold in the secondary market. 

Market interest rates have declined significantly during the pandemic. The lower interest rate environment has negatively affected our interest rate margin and, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect our net interest income and profitability. The sharp deterioration in the U.S. economy has negatively affected the value of our market sensitive investment securities portfolio. Further, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, may increase our cost of capital, may prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, and could result in a downgrade in our credit ratings. The economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially if prolonged, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

To protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, many of our employees are working remotely. We may experience increased costs of operations or other operational difficulties, including increased cybersecurity risk, due to the remote working environments of our employees. We may also experience additional operational risk due to difficulties experienced by our vendors. The effects of the pandemic and measures taken in response may subject us to increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny. 

Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of the pandemic or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus&#8217;s impact on the domestic and global economy. Accordingly, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (including without limitation our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and credit ratings) is highly uncertain, unpredictable and depends on factors including, among other things, new information that may emerge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and severity of the pandemic and responses to the pandemic by the government, businesses and consumers. 

Material risks relating to our business that are heightened due to the COVID-19 pandemic are listed in in Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 under the headings: 

&#8226; 

Deterioration in economic conditions may materially adversely affect the financial services industry and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

&#8226; 

Since our business is concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan and southern Wisconsin market areas, economic declines in the economy of this region could adversely affect our business. 

&#8226; 

If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer. 

&#8226; 

A significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower. 

&#8226; 

A substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, in particular commercial real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets could lead to additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8226; 

Events impacting collateral consisting of real property could lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8226; 

Any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models could cause us to miscalculate our projected revenue, capital, liquidity or losses, which could adversely affect our financial condition. 

&#8226; 

Changes in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income, which is our largest source of income. 

&#8226; 

Our liquidity position may be negatively impacted if economic conditions do not continue to improve or if they decline. 

&#8226; 

Damage to our reputation may harm our business. 

&#8226; 

An actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength may cause others to reduce or cease doing business with us, which could result in a decrease in our net interest income and fee revenues. 

&#8226; 

If our credit rating is lowered, our financing costs could increase. 

&#8226; 

If our growth requires us to raise additional capital, that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high. 

&#8226; 

Disruption in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. 

&#8226; 

Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm. 

&#8226; 

We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion and data corruption attempts, in addition to the resulting identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. 

&#8226; 

Our vendors may be responsible for failures that adversely affect our operations. 

&#8226; 

We are subject to claims and legal actions that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

&#8226; 

Losses incurred in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market may exceed our financial statement reserves and we may be required to increase such reserves in the future. Increases to our reserves and losses incurred in connection with actual loan repurchases and indemnification payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

&#8226; 

We may be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions. 

&#8226; 

Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could materially adversely affect how we report our financial results and financial condition. 

&#8226; 

We are a bank holding company, and our sources of funds, including to pay dividends, are limited. 

&#8226; 

Our business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as acts of war, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and public health threats. 

&#8226; 

If we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios, we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets. 

&#8226; 

Changes in the United States&#8217; monetary policy may restrict our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner. 

&#8226; 

Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future regarding the financial services industry may significantly increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner. 

&#8226; 

Our premium finance business may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations, and could expose us to losses. 

&#8226; 

Widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of FIRST Insurance Funding, Wintrust Life Finance and FIFC Canada. 

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 as well as any subsequent filing with the SEC. If the pandemic is prolonged, the adverse impacts and heightened risks noted above could worsen.
