 Item 1. Business 

Our Business 

Ally Financial Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, Ally, the Company, we, us, or our) is a financial-services company with $191.8 billion in assets as of December 31, 2022. The Company comprises the nation&#8217;s largest all-digital bank and an industry-leading automotive financing and insurance business, driven by a mission to &#8220;Do It Right&#8221; and be a relentless ally for customers and communities. The Company serves customers through a full range of online banking services (including deposits, mortgage lending, point-of-sale personal lending and credit-card products) and securities brokerage and investment advisory services. The Company also includes a corporate finance business that offers capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies. 

Ally is a Delaware corporation and is registered as a BHC under the BHC Act and an FHC under the GLB Act. Our primary business lines are Dealer Financial Services, which is composed of our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance. Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, the activity related to Ally Invest and Ally Lending, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. Beginning in December 2021 with the acquisition of Fair Square, which we rebranded as Ally Credit Card, financial information for our credit-card business is included within Corporate and Other. Ally Bank&#8217;s assets and operating results are included within our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance segments, as well as Corporate and Other, based on its underlying business activities. As of December 31, 2022, Ally Bank had total assets of $181.9 billion and total nonaffiliate deposits of $152.3 billion. 

Our long-term strategic objectives are centered around (1) differentiating our company as a relentless ally for financial well-being for consumer and commercial customers, (2) leveraging our &#8220;Do it Right&#8221; culture to drive enhanced value for our customers, communities, employees, and stockholders, (3) growing and diversifying our leading auto, insurance, and digital-bank platforms through increased scale and expanded product solutions to meet customer needs, (4) driving ongoing customer growth and relationship deepening, (5) operating under efficient, disciplined risk management and capital allocation approaches, (6) out-executing our competition and creating differentiated advantages through continuous investment and evolution among our leading experiences, products and brand, and (7) delivering long-term value through sustainable financial results and stockholder returns. Within our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, we are focused on strengthening our network of dealer relationships and pursuing digital distribution channels for our products and services, including through our operation of a direct-lending platform and our work with dealers innovating in digital transactions&#8212;all while maintaining an appropriate level of risk appetite. Within our other banking operations, including Mortgage Finance and Corporate Finance, we seek to expand our consumer and commercial banking products and services while providing a high level of customer service. We continue to focus on delivering significant growth and retention in deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. Ally Lending primarily serves medical and home improvement service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a digital application process at point-of-sale. At Ally Invest, we seek to augment our securities-brokerage and investment-advisory services to more comprehensively assist our customers in managing their savings and wealth. Additionally, we acquired Fair Square in December 2021, which provides us with a scalable, digital-first credit card platform, and advances our evolution as a leading digital consumer bank. Ally Credit Card features leading-edge technology, and a proprietary, analytics-based underwriting model. We believe the addition of credit card to our suite of products enhances our ability to grow and deepen both new and existing customer relationships. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply. The term &#8220;loans&#8221; means the following consumer and commercial products associated with our direct and indirect financing activities: loans, retail installment sales contracts, lines of credit, and other financing products excluding operating leases. The term &#8220;operating leases&#8221; means consumer- and commercial-vehicle lease agreements where Ally is the lessor and the lessee is generally not obligated to acquire ownership of the vehicle at lease-end or compensate Ally for the vehicle&#8217;s residual value. The terms &#8220;lend,&#8221; &#8220;finance,&#8221; and &#8220;originate&#8221; mean our direct extension or origination of loans, our purchase or acquisition of loans, or our purchase of operating leases, as applicable. The term &#8220;consumer&#8221; means all consumer products associated with our loan and operating-lease activities and all commercial retail installment sales contracts. The term &#8220;commercial&#8221; means all commercial products associated with our loan activities, other than commercial retail installment sales contracts. The term &#8220;partnerships&#8221; means business arrangements rather than partnerships as defined by law. 

For further details and information related to our business segments and the products and services they provide, refer to the MD&#38;A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry and Competition 

The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, point-of-sale personal lending, consumer credit cards, and deposits), securities brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance companies, and independent finance companies. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors in automotive financing and insurance, such as captive automotive finance companies, have certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturers whose customers and dealers make up a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, our banking, securities-brokerage, and investment-advisory businesses face intense competition from banks, savings associations, finance companies, credit unions, mutual funds, investment advisers, asset managers, brokerage firms, hedge funds, insurance companies, mortgage-banking companies, and credit-card companies. Fintech companies also compete with us directly as well as indirectly through partnership with banks and financial-services providers in lending, deposits, securities-brokerage, investment-advisory, and other markets. 

Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some also have significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, investment capacity, and brand recognition. Our competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent legislative, regulatory, and supervisory regimes than Ally. A range of competitors differ from us in their strategic and tactical priorities and, for example, may be willing to suffer meaningful financial losses in the pursuit of disruptive innovation and customer growth or to accept more aggressive business, compliance, and other risks in the pursuit of higher returns and market valuations. Competition affects every aspect of our business, including product and service offerings and features, rates, pricing and fees, credit limits, and customer service. Successfully competing in our markets also depends on our ability to innovate, to invest in technology and infrastructure, to execute transactions reliably and efficiently, to maintain and enhance our reputation, and to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, all while effectively managing risks and expenses. We expect that competition will only intensify in the future. 

Regulation and Supervision 

We are subject to significant regulatory frameworks in the United States&#8212;at federal, state, and local levels&#8212;that affect the products and services that we may offer and the manner in which we may offer them, the risks that we may take, the ways in which we may operate, and the corporate and financial actions that we may take. We also have limited businesses and operations in Canada and other countries that must comply with expansive legal frameworks there as well. 

We are also subject to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage, including the FRB, the UDFI, the FDIC, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, and a number of state regulatory and licensing authorities such as the NYDFS. These agencies and organizations generally have broad authority and discretion in restricting and otherwise affecting our businesses and operations and may take formal or informal supervisory, enforcement, and other actions against us when, in the applicable agency&#8217;s or organization&#8217;s judgment, our businesses or operations fail to comply with applicable law, comport with safe and sound practices, or meet its supervisory expectations. We strive to maintain constructive relationships with supervisory authorities. 

This system of regulation, supervision, and examination is intended primarily for the protection and benefit of our depositors and other customers, the FDIC&#8217;s DIF, the banking and financial systems as a whole, and the broader economy&#8212;and not for the protection or benefit of our stockholders (except in the case of securities laws) or non-deposit creditors. The scope, intensity, and focus of this system can vary from time to time for reasons that range from the state of the economic and political environments to the performance of our businesses and operations, but for the foreseeable future, we expect to remain subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examinations. 

This section summarizes some relevant provisions of the principal statutes, regulations, and other laws that apply to us. The descriptions, however, are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text and judicial or administrative interpretations of those laws and other laws that affect us. 

Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status 

Ally and IB Finance, a Delaware limited liability company, are BHCs under the BHC Act, and Ally has elected to be an FHC under the GLB Act. IB Finance is a direct subsidiary of Ally and the direct parent of Ally Bank, which is a commercial bank that is organized under the laws of the State of Utah and whose deposits are insured by the FDIC under the FDI Act. As BHCs, Ally and IB Finance are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Ally Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB, the UDFI, the FDIC, and the CFPB. 

&#8226; Permitted Activities &#8212; Under the BHC Act, BHCs and their subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and to closely related activities that are incident to banking. BHCs that qualify and elect to be treated as FHCs are generally permitted to engage, directly or indirectly through their nonbank subsidiaries, in a broader range of financial and related activities than those that are permissible for BHCs&#8212;for example, (1) underwriting, dealing in, and making a market in securities; (2) providing financial, investment, and economic advisory services; (3) underwriting insurance; and (4) merchant banking activities. The FRB regulates, supervises, and examines FHCs, as it does all BHCs, but insurance and securities activities conducted by an FHC or any of its nonbank subsidiaries are also regulated, supervised, and examined by functional regulators such as state insurance commissioners, the SEC, and FINRA. The expanded powers permitted to FHCs include the ability to provide insurance products and services, to deliver our SmartAuction finder services and a number of related vehicle-remarketing services for third parties, and to offer certain 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

kinds of brokerage and advisory services. To remain eligible to conduct and expand these broader financial and related activities, Ally must continue to be treated as an FHC. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section below titled Basel Capital Framework for additional information. In addition, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or to make acquisitions generally requires that we achieve a rating of satisfactory or better under the CRA. 

Further, under the BHC Act, we may be subject to approvals, conditions, and other restrictions when seeking to acquire control over another entity or its assets. For this purpose, &#8220;control&#8221; includes (a) directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding the power to vote 25% or more of any class of the entity&#8217;s voting securities, (b) controlling in any manner the election of a majority of the entity&#8217;s directors, trustees, or individuals performing similar functions, or (c) directly or indirectly exercising a controlling influence over the management or policies of the entity. Under rules of the FRB, whether Ally is presumed to have a &#8220;controlling influence&#8221; over an entity is determined by applying a framework of tiered presumptions of control that are based on the percentage of a class of voting securities held by Ally and nine other relationships with the entity. For example, Ally would be presumed to have such a controlling influence with less than 5% of a class of voting securities and any of the following: a management agreement with the entity, one-half or more of the directors on the entity&#8217;s board, or one-third or more of the total equity in the entity. 

&#8226; Enhanced Prudential Standards &#8212; Ally is subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the EGRRCP Act and as applied to Category IV firms under rules of the U.S. banking agencies that tailor how the enhanced prudential standards apply across large banking organizations (the Tailoring Rules). As a Category IV firm, Ally is (1) subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle, (2) required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, (3) exempted from company-run capital stress testing requirements, (4) required to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, (5) exempted from the requirements of the LCR and the net stable funding ratio (provided that our average wSTWF continues to remain under $50 billion), and (6) exempted from the requirements of the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and single-counterparty credit limits. Even so, we are subject to rules enabling the FRB to conduct supervisory stress testing on a more or less frequent basis based on our financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or activities or based on risks to the U.S. economy. Further, we are subject to rules requiring the resubmission of our capital plan if we determine that there has been or will be a material change in our risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since we last submitted the capital plan or if the FRB determines that (a) our capital plan is incomplete or our capital plan or internal capital adequacy process contains material weaknesses, (b) there has been, or will likely be, a material change in our risk profile (including a material change in our business strategy or any risk exposure), financial condition, or corporate structure, or (c) the BHC stress scenario(s) are not appropriate for our business model and portfolios, or changes in the financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook that could have a material impact on our risk profile and financial condition require the use of updated scenarios. While a resubmission is pending, without prior approval of the FRB, we would generally be prohibited from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions. In addition, to satisfy the FRB in its review of our capital plan, we may be required to further cease or limit these capital distributions or to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders. The FRB also may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities. 

&#8226; Capital Adequacy Requirements &#8212; Ally and Ally Bank are subject to various capital adequacy requirements. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section below titled Basel Capital Framework for additional information. 

&#8226; Capital Planning and Stress Tests &#8212; Under the Tailoring Rules, Ally is generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and exempted from mandated company-run capital stress testing requirements. Ally is also required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. 

Ally&#8217;s annual capital plan must include an assessment of its expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a detailed description of Ally&#8217;s process for assessing capital adequacy, including a discussion of how Ally, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank, and will maintain sufficient capital to continue its operations by maintaining ready access to funding, meeting its obligations to creditors and other counterparties, and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. 

The Tailoring Rules align capital planning, supervisory stress testing, and stress capital buffer requirements for large banking organizations like Ally. As a Category IV firm, Ally is expected to have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test&#8212;and receive a correspondingly updated stress capital buffer requirement&#8212;in a year in which Ally would not generally be subject to the supervisory stress test. Refer to the section below titled Basel Capital Framework for further discussion about our stress capital buffer requirements. During a year in which Ally does not undergo a supervisory stress test, we would receive an updated stress capital buffer requirement only to reflect our updated planned common-stock dividends. Ally was subject to the 2022 supervisory stress test and did not elect to participate in the 2023 supervisory stress test. 

&#8226; Resolution Planning &#8212; Under rules of the FDIC, Ally Bank is required to periodically submit to the FDIC a resolution plan (commonly known as a living will) that would enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve Ally Bank in the event of its insolvency 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

under the FDI Act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of Ally Bank&#8217;s failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in the resolution. If the FDIC determines that the resolution plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not adequately remediated in a timely manner, the FDIC may take formal or informal supervisory, enforcement, and other actions against us. In June 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans for Insured Depository Institutions, which in part establishes a three-year filing cycle for banks with $100 billion or more in total assets like Ally Bank. Ally Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan on December 1, 2022, which is now under review by the FDIC for a period of up to 12 months. 

Under the Tailoring Rules, Ally is no longer required to submit to the FRB and the FDIC a plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of Ally and its significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. 

&#8226; Limitations on Bank and BHC Dividends and Other Capital Distributions &#8212; Federal and Utah law place a number of conditions, limits, and other restrictions on dividends and other capital distributions that may be paid by Ally Bank to IB Finance and thus indirectly to Ally. In addition, even if the FRB does not require us to resubmit our capital plan as described earlier in Capital Planning and Stress Tests , Ally and IB Finance may be precluded from or limited in paying dividends or other capital distributions without the FRB&#8217;s approval under certain circumstances&#8212;for example, if Ally or IB Finance were to not meet minimum regulatory capital ratios after giving effect to the distributions. FRB supervisory guidance also directs BHCs like us to consult with the FRB prior to increasing dividends, implementing common-stock-repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Further, the U.S. banking agencies are authorized to prohibit an insured depository institution, like Ally Bank, or a BHC, like Ally, from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and, depending upon the circumstances, could find that paying a dividend or other capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For information about our capital actions, including repurchases of and cash dividends on our common stock, refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB&#8217;s review and our internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, accounting and regulatory considerations (including any restrictions that may be imposed by the FRB), taxation of share repurchases, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. 

&#8226; Transactions with Affiliates &#8212; Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W prevent Ally and its nonbank subsidiaries from taking undue advantage of the benefits afforded to Ally Bank as a depository institution, including its access to federal deposit insurance and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. Pursuant to these laws, covered transactions&#8212;including Ally Bank&#8217;s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its affiliates, credit exposures to affiliates arising from derivative transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral&#8212;are generally subject to meaningful restrictions. For example, unless otherwise exempted, (1) covered transactions are limited to 10% of Ally Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus in the case of any individual affiliate and 20% of Ally Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus in the case of all affiliates; (2) Ally Bank&#8217;s credit transactions with an affiliate are generally subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) with few exceptions, Ally Bank may not purchase any low quality asset from an affiliate; and (4) covered transactions must be conducted on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, transactions between Ally Bank and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are either substantially the same as or more beneficial to Ally Bank than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliates. 

These laws include an attribution rule that treats a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonaffiliate as a transaction between Ally Bank and an affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of or transferred to the affiliate. 

&#8226; Source of Strength &#8212; Ally is required to serve as a source of financial strength for Ally Bank and to commit resources to support Ally Bank in circumstances when Ally might not otherwise elect to do so. The functional regulator of any nonbank subsidiary of Ally, however, may prevent that subsidiary from directly or indirectly contributing its financial support, and if that were to preclude Ally from serving as an adequate source of financial strength, the FRB may instead require the divestiture of Ally Bank and impose operating restrictions pending such a divestiture. 

&#8226; Orderly Liquidation Authority &#8212; Under the Dodd-Frank Act, if a BHC&#8217;s failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States and other specified conditions were met, the BHC may be subjected to an FDIC-administered resolution regime called the orderly liquidation authority as an alternative to bankruptcy. If Ally were to be placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC as receiver would have considerable rights and powers in liquidating and winding up Ally, including the ability to assign assets and liabilities without the need for creditor consent or prior court review and the ability to differentiate and determine priority among creditors. In doing so, moreover, the FDIC&#8217;s primary goal would be a liquidation that mitigates risk to the financial stability of the United States and that minimizes moral hazard. 

&#8226; Acceptance of Brokered Deposits &#8212; Under FDICIA and the PCA framework described later in Basel Capital Framework , insured depository institutions such as Ally Bank must be well capitalized or, with a waiver from the FDIC, adequately capitalized in order 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

to accept brokered deposits, and even adequately capitalized institutions are subject to some restrictions on the rates they may offer for brokered deposits. At December 31, 2022, Ally Bank met the capital ratios necessary to be classified as well capitalized under the PCA framework. Brokered deposits totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2022, which represented 8.3% of Ally Bank&#8217;s total deposits. 

&#8226; Enforcement Authority &#8212; The FRB possesses extensive authorities and powers to regulate and supervise the conduct of Ally&#8217;s businesses and operations. If the FRB were to take the position that Ally or any of its subsidiaries have violated any law or commitment or engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice, formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions could be taken by the FRB against Ally, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties (such as directors, officers, and agents). The UDFI and the FDIC have similarly expansive authorities and powers over Ally Bank and its subsidiaries. For example, the FRB, the UDFI, or the FDIC could order us to cease and desist from engaging in specified activities or practices or could affirmatively compel us to correct specified violations or practices. Some or all of these governmental authorities also would have the power, as applicable, to issue administrative orders against us that can be judicially enforced, to direct us to increase capital and liquidity, to limit our dividends and other capital distributions, to restrict or redirect the growth of our assets, businesses, and operations, to compel us to change our practices and remediate harm alleged to have been suffered by consumers or others, to assess civil money penalties against us, to remove our officers and directors, to require the divestiture or the retention of assets or entities, to terminate deposit insurance, or to force us into bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership. These actions could directly affect not only Ally, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties but also Ally&#8217;s counterparties, stockholders, and creditors and its commitments, arrangements, and other dealings with them. 

In addition, the CFPB has broad authorities and powers to enforce federal consumer-protection laws involving financial products and services. The CFPB has exercised these authorities and powers through public enforcement actions, lawsuits, and consent orders and through nonpublic enforcement actions. 

The SEC, FINRA, the Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other domestic or foreign governmental authorities also have an array of means at their disposal to regulate and enforce matters within their jurisdiction that could impact Ally&#8217;s businesses and operations. 

Basel Capital Framework 

The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have adopted risk-based and leverage capital rules that establish minimum capital-to-asset ratios for BHCs, like Ally, and depository institutions, like Ally Bank. 

The risk-based capital ratios are based on a banking organization&#8217;s RWAs, which are generally determined under the standardized approach applicable to Ally and Ally Bank by (1) assigning on-balance-sheet exposures to broad risk-weight categories according to the counterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or collateral (with higher risk weights assigned to categories of exposures perceived as representing greater risk), and (2) multiplying off-balance-sheet exposures by specified credit conversion factors to calculate credit equivalent amounts and assigning those credit equivalent amounts to the relevant risk-weight categories. The leverage ratio, in contrast, is based on an institution&#8217;s average unweighted on-balance-sheet exposures. 

Under U.S. Basel III, Ally and Ally Bank must maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. On top of the minimum risk-based capital ratios, Ally and Ally Bank are subject to a capital conservation buffer requirement, which must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Failure to maintain more than the full amount of the capital conservation buffer requirement would result in automatic restrictions on the ability of Ally and Ally Bank to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. U.S. Basel III also subjects Ally and Ally Bank to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. While the capital conservation buffer requirement for Ally Bank is fixed at 2.5% of RWAs, the capital conservation buffer requirement for a Category IV firm like Ally is equal to its stress capital buffer requirement. The stress capital buffer requirement for Ally, in turn, is the greater of 2.5% and the result of the following calculation: (1) the difference between Ally&#8217;s starting and minimum projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test, plus (2) the sum of the dollar amount of Ally&#8217;s planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of its nine-quarter capital planning horizon, as a percentage of RWAs. As of December 31, 2022, the stress capital buffer requirement for Ally is 2.5%. 

Ally and Ally Bank are subject to the U.S. Basel III standardized approach for counterparty credit risk but not to the U.S. Basel III advanced approaches for credit risk or operational risk. Ally is also not subject to the U.S. market-risk capital rule, which applies only to banking organizations with significant trading assets and liabilities. 

The risk-based capital ratios and the Tier 1 leverage ratio play a central role in PCA, which is an enforcement framework used by the U.S. banking agencies to constrain the activities of depository institutions based on their levels of regulatory capital. Five categories have been established using thresholds for the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the total risk-based capital ratio, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including any payment of a cash dividend or a management fee to its BHC, if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after the distribution. An undercapitalized institution is also subject to growth limitations and must submit and fulfill a capital restoration plan. Although BHCs are not subject to the PCA framework, the FRB is empowered to compel a BHC to take measures&#8212;such as the execution of financial or performance 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

guarantees&#8212;when PCA is required in connection with one of its depository-institution subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, Ally Bank met the capital ratios required to be well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

At December 31, 2022, Ally and Ally Bank were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements. For an additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our allowance for loan losses accounting policy. Under a rule finalized by the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies in 2020, we delayed recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extended through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we were required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital that we deferred and began phasing in on January 1, 2022, is generally calculated as the entire day-one impact at adoption plus 25% of the subsequent change in allowance during the two-year deferral period. As of December 31, 2022, the total deferred impact on Common Equity Tier 1 capital related to our adoption of CECL was $887 million. 

In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as the Basel III endgame or as Basel IV), many of which&#8212;if adopted in the United States&#8212;could heighten regulatory capital standards. While these revisions were planned for implementation by member countries by January 1, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies have yet to propose rules to do so. At this time, how the revisions will be harmonized and finalized in the United States remains unclear. 

Insured Depository Institution Status 

Ally Bank is an insured depository institution and, as such, is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC about its financial condition. Total assets of Ally Bank were $181.9 billion at December 31, 2022, $172.8 billion at December 31, 2021, and $172.0 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Ally Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC in the standard insurance amounts per depositor for each account ownership category as prescribed by the FDI Act. Insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts, including Ally Bank, are required by the FDIC to establish and maintain systems and processes designed to facilitate prompt payment of FDIC-insured deposits in the event of a failure. Deposit insurance is funded through assessments on Ally Bank and other insured depository institutions. The FDIC assesses premiums from each institution based on its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity, while utilizing a scorecard method to determine each institution&#8217;s risk to the DIF. The FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DIF is not funded to its regulatory-mandated DRR. Currently, the FDIC is required to maintain a DRR of 1.35% under the FDI Act. In October 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules for all insured depository institutions by two basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate is intended to improve the likelihood that the DRR will reach the required minimum of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. 

If an insured depository institution like Ally Bank were to become insolvent or if other specified events were to occur relating to its financial condition or the propriety of its actions, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver for the institution. In that capacity, the FDIC would have the power to (1) transfer assets and liabilities of the institution to another person or entity without the approval of the institution&#8217;s creditors; (2) require that its claims process be followed and to enforce statutory or other limits on damages claimed by the institution&#8217;s creditors; (3) enforce the institution&#8217;s contracts or leases according to their terms; (4) repudiate or disaffirm the institution&#8217;s contracts or leases; (5) seek to reclaim, recover, or recharacterize transfers of the institution&#8217;s assets or to exercise control over assets in which the institution may claim an interest; (6) enforce statutory or other injunctions; and (7) exercise a wide range of other rights, powers, and authorities, including those that could impair the rights and interests of all or some of the institution&#8217;s creditors. In addition, the administrative expenses of the conservator or receiver could be afforded priority over all or some of the claims of the institution&#8217;s creditors, and under the FDI Act, the claims of depositors (including the FDIC as subrogee of depositors) would enjoy priority over the claims of the institution&#8217;s unsecured creditors. 

Investments in Ally 

Because Ally Bank is an insured depository institution and Ally and IB Finance are BHCs, direct or indirect control of us&#8212;whether through the ownership of voting securities, influence over management or policies, or other means&#8212;is subject to approvals, conditions, and other restrictions under federal and state laws. Refer to the section above titled Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status for additional information. These laws may differ in their purposes, definitions and presumptions of control, and restrictions, which for example is the case as between the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire control of us in contravention of these laws. 

Insurance Companies 

Some of our insurance operations&#8212;including in the United States, Canada, and Bermuda&#8212;are subject to certain minimum aggregate capital requirements, net asset and dividend restrictions, and rules and regulations promulgated by various U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. Under state and foreign insurance laws, dividend distributions may be made only from statutory unassigned surplus with approvals required from applicable regulatory authorities for dividends in excess of statutory limitations. Our insurance operations are also subject to applicable state and foreign laws generally governing insurance companies, as well as laws addressing products that are not regulated as insurance, such as VSCs and GAP waivers.

Consumer Finance 

Our retail-automotive, consumer-mortgage, personal-lending, and credit-card businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws. These laws, for example, may impose licensing obligations and financial requirements; limit the interest rates, finance charges, and other fees that can be charged; regulate the use of credit reports and the reporting of credit information; impose underwriting and disclosure requirements; regulate marketing techniques and practices; require the safeguarding of nonpublic information about customers; and regulate servicing practices, including in connection with assessments, collection and foreclosure activities, claims handling, and investment and interest payments on escrow accounts. The laws applicable to consumer finance are complex and subject to change and to changes in interpretation and enforcement. Further, many existing laws were enacted without anticipating technological and related innovations&#8212;including those utilized by fintech companies and the banks and financial-services providers that partner with them&#8212;and as a result, the application of these legal frameworks is not always clear and can be subject to wide supervisory and enforcement discretion. 

Ally Invest Subsidiaries 

Ally Invest Securities LLC (Ally Invest Securities) is registered as a securities broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, is registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as a municipal securities broker-dealer, and is a member of FINRA and SIPC. As a result, Ally Invest Securities and its personnel are subject to extensive requirements under the Exchange Act, SEC regulations, SRO rules, and state laws, which collectively cover all aspects of the firm&#8217;s securities activities&#8212;including sales and trading practices, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, privacy, anti-money laundering, financial and other reporting, supervision, misuse of material nonpublic information, conduct of its business in accordance with just and equitable principles of trade, and personnel qualifications. The firm operates as an introducing broker and clears all transactions, including all customer transactions, through a third-party clearing broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis. 

Ally Invest Forex LLC (Ally Invest Forex) is registered with the CFTC as an introducing broker and is a member of the NFA, which is the primary SRO for the U.S. futures industry. The firm is subject to similarly expansive requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act, CFTC and NFA rules governing introducing brokers and their personnel, and CFTC retail forex rules. 

Ally Invest Advisors Inc. (Ally Invest Advisors) is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. As a result, the firm is subject to a host of requirements governing investment advisers and their personnel under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and related rules and regulations, including certain fiduciary and other obligations with respect to its relationships with its investment advisory clients. 

Regulators conduct periodic examinations of Ally Invest Securities, Ally Invest Forex, and Ally Invest Advisors and regularly review reports that the firms are required to submit on an ongoing basis. Violations of relevant regulatory requirements could result in adverse consequences for the firms and their personnel, including censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and restriction, suspension or expulsion from the securities or commodity-futures industries. 

Other Laws 

Ally is subject to numerous federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and other laws, and the possibility of violating applicable law presents ongoing compliance, operational, reputation, and other risks to Ally. Some of the other more significant laws to which we are subject include: 

&#8226; Privacy and Data Security &#160;&#8212; The GLB Act and related regulations impose obligations on financial institutions, within specified parameters and circumstances, to safeguard consumer information maintained by them, to provide notice of their privacy practices to consumers, and to allow consumers to opt out of information sharing with unaffiliated parties. Related regulatory guidance also directs financial institutions to notify consumers in specified cases of unauthorized access to sensitive consumer information. In addition, most states have enacted laws requiring notice of specified cases of unauthorized access to information. For example, the NYDFS has imposed significant requirements on regulated entities to establish cybersecurity programs and policies, to designate chief information security officers, to comply with notice and reporting obligations, and to take other actions in connection with the security of their information. In addition, comprehensive privacy laws have been enacted in California that require regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information. 

In November 2021, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule establishing notification requirements for banking organizations and bank service providers in connection with significant computer security incidents. Under the rule, a BHC, such as Ally, and a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as Ally Bank are required to notify the FRB within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization&#8217;s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The rule also requires bank service providers to notify us of any computer security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption for four or more hours. 

&#8226; Volcker Rule &#160;&#8212; Section 13 of the BHC Act and its implementing regulations (commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule) prohibit banking entities, subject to limited exceptions, from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in or sponsoring covered funds. The Volcker Rule contains exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, and trading in U.S. government and agency obligations. The Volcker Rule also permits the retention of ownership interests in certain types of funds and the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. For firms with limited trading assets and liabilities, like Ally, the regulatory agencies have simplified and streamlined compliance requirements under the Volcker Rule. The regulatory agencies also have clarified that 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

banking entities may engage in activities that do not raise concerns that the Volcker Rule was intended to address, including in connection with specified credit funds, venture-capital funds, family-wealth-management vehicles, and customer-facilitation vehicles. 

&#8226; Fair Lending Laws &#160;&#8212; The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and similar fair-lending laws (collectively, Fair Lending Laws) generally prohibit a creditor from discriminating against an applicant or borrower in any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of specified characteristics known as prohibited bases, such as race, gender, and religion. Creditors are also required under the Fair Lending Laws to follow a number of highly prescriptive rules, including rules requiring credit decisions to be made promptly, notices of adverse actions to be given, and, in the case of mortgage lenders of a certain size, anonymized data and information about mortgage applicants and credit decisions to be gathered and made publicly available. 

&#8226; Fair Credit Reporting Act &#160;&#8212; The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the dissemination of credit reports by credit reporting agencies, requires users of credit reports to provide specified notices to the subjects of those reports, imposes standards on the furnishing of information to credit reporting agencies, obligates furnishers to maintain reasonable procedures to deal with the risk of identity theft, addresses the sharing of specified kinds of information with affiliates and third parties, and regulates the use of credit reports to make preapproved offers of credit and insurance to consumers. 

&#8226; Truth in Lending Act &#160;&#8212; The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z, which implements TILA, require lenders to provide borrowers with uniform, understandable information about the terms and conditions in certain credit transactions. These rules apply to Ally and its subsidiaries when they extend credit to consumers and require, in the case of certain loans, conspicuous disclosure of the finance charge and annual percentage rate, as applicable. In addition, if an advertisement for credit states specific credit terms, Regulation Z requires that the advertisement state only those terms that actually are or will be arranged or offered by the creditor together with specified notices. The CFPB in recent years has issued substantial amendments to the mortgage requirements under Regulation Z, and additional changes are likely in the future. Amendments to Regulation Z and Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, require integrated mortgage loan disclosures to be provided for applications received on or after October 3, 2015. Further, TILA imposes a number of restrictions on credit-card practices impacting rates and fees, requires that a consumer&#8217;s ability to pay be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits, and imposes certain disclosure requirements related to provision of open-end credit. 

&#8226; Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money-Laundering Requirements &#160; &#8212; The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, contains provisions designed to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act generally requires banks, certain other financial institutions, and, in certain cases, BHCs to undertake activities such as maintaining an anti-money-laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting on suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to certain requests for information by regulatory authorities and law-enforcement agencies. 

In January 2021, the Bank Secrecy Act was amended by the AMLA, which comprehensively reforms and modernizes U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. The AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money-laundering compliance for financial institutions, requires the U.S. Treasury Department to develop standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for Bank Secrecy Act compliance, directs the FinCEN to establish a registration database of beneficial-ownership information that designated companies will be required to report, and expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority and available sanctions for specified Bank Secrecy Act violations. In June 2021, FinCEN issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and proliferation financing. Many provisions of the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports, and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend at least in part on their development and implementation. 

&#8226; Community Reinvestment Act &#8212; Under the CRA, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income persons and neighborhoods. Although the CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs, banks are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. 

In its most recent performance evaluation in 2020, Ally Bank received an &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; rating. Ally Bank operated under a three-year CRA strategic plan (2020&#8211;2022) that had been approved by the FRB and is currently operating under a four-year CRA strategic plan (2023&#8211;2026) that also has been approved by the FRB. Failure by Ally Bank to maintain a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; or better rating under the CRA may adversely affect our ability to expand our financial and related activities as an FHC or make acquisitions. Refer to the section above titled Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status for additional information. 

&#8226; LIBOR Act &#8212; In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted. The LIBOR Act provides a uniform approach for replacing LIBOR as a reference interest rate in tough legacy contracts when LIBOR is no longer published or is no longer representative. Tough legacy contracts are contracts that do not include effective fallback provisions, for example, because they have no provisions for replacement benchmarks or provisions based on prior LIBOR values or dealer polls. Under the LIBOR Act, references to the most common tenors of LIBOR in these contracts will be replaced as a matter of law, without the need to be 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

amended by the parties, to instead reference benchmark interest rates based on SOFR that will be identified by the FRB. The FRB issued a final rule effective February 27, 2023, to implement the LIBOR Act. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this report for additional information regarding Ally&#8217;s efforts to transition away from LIBOR. 

&#8226; Executive and Incentive Compensation &#8212; Through guidance adopted in 2010, the U.S. banking agencies conveyed their expectation that banking organizations maintain incentive-compensation practices that are consistent with safety and soundness, even when these practices go beyond those needed to align shareholder and employee interests. To be consistent with safety and soundness, incentive-compensation arrangements at a banking organization should (i) provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. Enforcement action may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive-compensation arrangements or related risk-management, control, or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness, particularly when the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NYSE, to implement listing standards that require all listed companies to adopt and comply with policies mandating the prompt recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement, including a restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected or left uncorrected in the current period. The erroneously awarded compensation to be recovered would be the excess over the amount that the executive officer would have otherwise received had the incentive-based compensation been determined using the restated financial statements and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid. The final rule requires the exchanges to propose conforming listing standards no later than February 27, 2023, and requires the standards to become effective no later than November 28, 2023. Each listed company, including Ally, will be required to adopt a policy that complies with the NYSE listing standard no later than 60 days following effectiveness of the standard. 

Human Capital 

Our team members are integral to the success of our business, and central to our strategy is attracting, developing, and retaining talented individuals with the right skills to drive our business forward. We emphasize a working environment and company culture that embrace diverse talents, backgrounds, and perspectives and where colleagues feel valued as both individuals and members of the team. We had approximately 11,600 and 10,500 employees as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which consisted primarily of full-time employees in the United States. Our employee growth for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily attributable to expansion in the overall business and our information technology organization. 

Oversight and Governance 

The identification, prioritization, mitigation, and monitoring of human-capital risks, in alignment with our enterprise risk management framework, allows us to maintain a well-controlled operational environment. Enterprise policies, HR programs, and risk and control assessment and effectiveness tests are completed and reviewed at least once a year. Transparency in risk reporting&#8212;through issue management, quarterly business reviews, risk committees, and audits&#8212;supports appropriate governance and oversight for human capital measures and processes. Our priority is to maintain the safety and soundness of Ally, our culture, and our workforce. 

The Compensation, Nominating, and Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for the oversight of our human capital management. This Committee and Ally&#8217;s Executive Council biannually review organizational health metrics and progress toward cultural priorities including our DE&#38;I efforts. Annually, the Board reviews and approves Ally&#8217;s Code of Conduct and Ethics, which establishes how employees must conduct themselves and is required to be attested to by all employees on an annual basis. 

The management of our human capital resources is a core responsibility of our leaders. Leaders recognize the importance of attracting, engaging, and retaining talented employees at all levels of the organization. Human capital risk appetite limits, comprising voluntary turnover and succession planning, are tracked and communicated as appropriate. Other human capital risk mitigation activities include: 

&#8226; Active monitoring of market competition, industry trends and wages, overall benefits structure, engagement surveys, and exit surveys. 

&#8226; Strategic talent assessment and planning routines focused on promoting internal mobility, diverse representation, and professional growth. 

&#8226; Succession planning processes to facilitate business continuity. 

The HR leadership team reports to Ally&#8217;s Chief HR Officer and includes our Chief Diversity Officer, Chief Ethics Officer, and other direct reports that work with our leaders to identify human capital metrics that are designed to promote the health of our organization. At least quarterly, our Chief Diversity Officer conducts a diversity council session with senior leaders. 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

Culture 

We recognize our long-term success is underpinned by the strength of our purpose-driven culture&#8212;a culture that we believe sets us apart from the competition and gives us an advantage as we recruit and retain talented team members. Our people-first approach enables a winning, customer-centric philosophy focused on resiliency, adaptability, and a growth-mindset-oriented drive to &#8220;Be (Even) Better.&#8221; We strive to uphold our mantra to &#8220;Do it Right&#8221; through decisions and deeds at all levels of the organization, and we collectively commit to work with integrity and accountability and to uphold our core values in the workplace, the marketplace, and the community. Our culture is driven by our &#8220;LEAD&#8221; core values, where we emphasize that employees: 

&#8226; [ L ]ook externally &#8211; We strive to meet and exceed the needs of our customers with agility, speed, and innovation. We continually evolve, respond quickly, and deliver a superior customer experience by: 

&#9702; Finding strategies, processes, and initiatives that do right by our customers and their unique needs. 

&#9702; Being adaptable, resourceful, and proactive in problem-solving, incorporating different viewpoints and fresh ideas into their work. 

&#9702; Responding quickly to change and escalating issues immediately. 

&#8226; [ E ]xecute with excellence &#8211; Good enough is never enough. With a focus on continuous improvement, our actions are driven by sound analysis and an intense focus on excellence. Executing with excellence means: 

&#9702; Not stopping at the obvious answer&#8212;staying curious and respectfully challenging the status quo. 

&#9702; Being open to new ideas and ways to do better, be better and deliver more meaningful solutions. 

&#9702; Calling attention to risks, and challenging that which does not seem right while remaining respectful of established policies. 

&#8226; [ A ]ct with professionalism &#8211; We operate with integrity, hold ourselves and each other accountable, treat others with respect, and embrace diversity and inclusion. This is the cornerstone to our long-term success and at the very foundation of what it means to be an ally. With an emphasis on: 

&#9702; Celebrating the unique perspectives, talents, and contributions of others. 

&#9702; Leveraging the experience and knowledge that peers, colleagues, and leaders have to offer. 

&#9702; Creating strong and collaborative relationships built on mutual respect and accountability. 

&#8226; [ D ]eliver results &#8211; We are passionate about winning &#8211; for our customers, our teams, and our company. Success is measured at both the outcome and the path to achieve it. We deliver results by: 

&#9702; Making an impact and bringing an inspired attitude, competitive spirit, and passion for real results. 

&#9702; Being transparent and communicating current and emerging risks. 

&#9702; Leading the charge and supporting the successes of others. 

Our annual, CEO-sponsored enterprise-wide recognition program, &#8220;LEADing the Way,&#8221; is designed to recognize employees whose leadership and performance consistently model our core values in one or more of the following areas: innovation, risk culture, corporate citizenship, customer experience, DE&#38;I, process improvement, or other attributes that reflect our overall culture. This award is one of the highest recognitions an employee can receive at Ally. In 2022, 80 team members were recognized with this award. Recipients are nominated based on exceeding their LEAD core value performance objective, which is required for all employees. Additionally, employees can nominate colleagues for the quarterly peer-to-peer &#8220;I&#8217;m An Ally&#8221; award recognition program that provides employees the opportunity to recognize the hard work of individuals across the entire organization. These recognition programs reinforce our continued commitment to our culture. 

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 

We believe the best ideas come from a collective mixture of different voices and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer, and we strive for an inclusive work environment where all backgrounds, experiences, interests, viewpoints, and skills are respected, appreciated, and encouraged&#8212;consistent with our culture. We are focused on diverse representation and retention in the workforce&#8212;including different genders, races, nationalities, sexual orientations, and other identities&#8212;across all levels of the organization from entry to leadership. Fostering these diverse perspectives is important and reflects the beliefs and actions that are the backbone of our culture. 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

We have a deliberate focus on DE&#38;I with an intentional emphasis on inclusion, which expands beyond traditional definitions of diversity. Notably, our company-wide engagement survey score for belonging improved by two points in 2022 and remains eight points above the financial services industry benchmark, as measured by our third-party provider. The importance of DE&#38;I starts at the top with our CEO and Board, who consistently stress the value in leveraging our differences. In June 2017, our CEO was among the first 150 CEOs who signed on to the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity and Inclusion, and this commitment has been renewed every year since. Our Board and Executive Council have also publicly pledged our continuing support for all groups with a heightened focus on Black, Hispanic, and Latino colleagues, suppliers, partners, and communities in the promotion of equity and equality. 

Our DE&#38;I Council provides executive leadership on DE&#38;I and promotes belonging at Ally and in our communities. A subset of our commitment to DE&#38;I is a Financial and Social Inclusion Framework that is built upon four pillars: Community, Customers, Employees, and Suppliers. 

&#8226; Community: Continue to create opportunities for economic mobility in the communities where we work and live, especially for our Black, Hispanic, and Latino neighbors, who often face disproportionate challenges. 

&#8226; Employees: Community betterment starts from the inside out. As such, we aspire to create a diverse workforce that is truly reflective of the communities in which we live and work. 

&#8226; Customers: Help enable financial and social inclusion through our culture of customer obsession, by developing education and solutions to support and strengthen economic mobility for all. 

&#8226; Suppliers: We are intentional about collaborating and working with a diverse group of minority and women-owned business enterprises. 

These four pillars are championed by our employees, which empowers us to advance DE&#38;I efforts in meaningful ways beyond Ally. Additionally, these efforts are further supported by our Chief Diversity Officer, and 18 full-time employees designated to advance DE&#38;I within Ally. While our Financial and Social Inclusion Framework is focused on addressing the wealth gap, specifically in Black, Hispanic, and Latino communities, the four pillars are reflective of our DE&#38;I efforts more broadly as further discussed below. 

Community 

Our approach to community is inclusive and integrates our employees across the organization. We help our employees develop their own skills while serving our communities with their time and talent. We encourage our employees to utilize eight paid hours per year to volunteer in their communities. Employees can donate to eligible nonprofit organizations by credit, debit, or payroll deductions, and Ally will give a dollar-for-dollar match up to $1,000 per eligible employee, per calendar year. In 2022, our employees volunteered approximately 44,000 hours, a record for us. We also matched our employees&#8217; donations of time and dollars resulting in $2.3 million for our communities. Both of these milestones reflect our culture of giving back. 

Our philanthropic approach is primarily based on a framework of economic mobility. We support programs that provide opportunities to individuals and families in low- and moderate-income communities with a focus on three areas: affordable housing, financial literacy, and workforce development. We solely funded the Ally Charitable Foundation, a non-consolidated entity, which has approximately $70 million in assets as of December 31, 2022, to drive positive and lasting impacts in our communities. The Ally Charitable Foundation is governed by six senior Ally employees that meet quarterly to approve certain grants, monitor our investments, and provide strategic guidance. In 2022, the Ally Charitable Foundation made a pledge of $5 million, to be funded over five years, to the Atrium Health Foundation to support equitable opportunities for individuals pursuing careers in healthcare. The grant established the Ally Charitable Foundation Workforce Development Center of Excellence, as well as the Ally Charitable Foundation Workforce Development Scholarship Fund. Through the Ally Charitable Foundation Workforce Development Center of Excellence, individuals from low- and moderate-income or diverse populations will have access to a variety of career development pathways to fulfill their educational objectives. Additionally, the Ally Charitable Foundation increased its financial support of trust-based philanthropy, a philanthropic approach that supports extraordinary, grassroots nonprofits led by Black, Hispanic, and Latino individuals. Beyond its financial support, the organizations were provided professional development, technical assistance, and marketing support. 

One of our largest and most powerful initiatives is Moguls in the Making, an annual competition that fosters opportunities for students from historically black colleges and universities. The annual program was launched in 2019 in collaboration with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the Sean Anderson Foundation. In 2022, we sponsored the fourth Moguls in the Making competition, with 60 students, who brought innovative and impactful solutions to economic mobility challenges. Since the program&#8217;s inception, we have offered internships to 43 students, which have often led to permanent job placements within Ally or the broader financial-services industry. 

Our financial education approach is focused on providing content and programs to advance economic mobility for individuals and families. We leverage our team members and community partners to teach critical financial skills to assist those that we serve towards their financial goals. 

Our work in the communities is woven throughout our culture. We originated, as defined in our CRA strategic plan approved by the FRB, approximately $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion in loans and investments that primarily benefit low- and moderate-income individuals and communities as part of our CRA program during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In 2022, we executed on our ongoing commitment of expanding access to capital for Black, Hispanic, and Latino communities by deploying $33 million in loans and 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

investments specifically to minority- and women-led organizations such as The 22 Fund, BetaBoom, and Raza Development Fund. These loans and investments are instrumental in providing the financial foundation required to help develop and create more opportunities for the next generation of successful Black, Hispanic, and Latino entrepreneurs, investors, affordable housing developers, and community leaders. We also provided nearly $1.5 million in grants to 68 non-profit organizations, including 17 organizations that are either minority-led or supported initiatives targeting primarily Black, Hispanic, or Latino individuals. Additionally, Ally Bank received consecutive &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; CRA ratings in our last two reviews. 

Employees 

We take deliberate steps to weave DE&#38;I through all our human capital efforts: from pipelining candidates, onboarding, all the way through the employee lifecycle. With this approach, we have been able to build on our LEAD culture to celebrate the differences that our employees bring to the workplace. In 2022, we expanded our implementation of unconscious bias mitigation and awareness training to help leaders and team members across the organization understand the impacts of unconscious bias on our decision-making processes. Every employee has a specific culture-related performance objective, which includes a strong focus on DE&#38;I. Additionally, for all executive leaders, annual performance objectives and reviews include a specific focus on representation and diversity trends within the workforce. The importance of DE&#38;I is consistently reinforced by executive leadership through town hall meetings, employee communications, and active participation in and sponsorship of our ERGs. A diverse and inclusive workforce makes us stronger, as well as more agile, innovative, and adaptable. We believe it benefits our various stakeholders culturally, operationally, and financially. 

We maintain eight ERGs sponsored by members of Ally&#8217;s Executive Council and chaired by leaders from multiple levels of management across Ally. These ERGs consist of: Aliados, Asian/Middle Eastern, Black/African American, Diverse Abilities, Generational, Pride, Veteran, and Women ALLYs. Membership in our ERGs is voluntary and open to all employees, whether they identify with the ERG or view themselves as an ally to the group. As we celebrated the fifth anniversary of ERGs in 2022, employee participation grew to more than 50% of our workforce belonging to at least one ERG as of December 31, 2022, as compared to 43% as of December 31, 2021. Beyond our ERGs, our Technology Organization also launched two diversity-focused groups that explore the obstacles to inclusivity that exist specifically within the technology industry. These two groups were Women in Technology (WiT) and Black and Brown in Technology (BBiT). Our objective across all the groups is to foster a workplace environment where all employees have a sense of belonging and know their opinions count. 

Our commitment to inclusion emphasizes representation transparency, accountability, and action for our employees. As of December 31, 2022, our gender representation is approximately 51% men and 49% women. We increased representation of women and people of color in our manager and above roles, and redesigned programs to create more opportunities for early talent. 

The following table presents our employee representation of women, and Black or African American, Latino or Hispanic, or Asian individuals as a percentage of all employees. 

##TABLE_START 2022 (a) 2021 (a) December 31, Women Black or African American Latino or Hispanic Asian Women Black or African American Latino or Hispanic Asian Associate 73 &#160; % 50 &#160; % 11 &#160; % 3 &#160; % 73 % 50 % 10 % 3 % Analyst 47 &#160; 19 &#160; 9 &#160; 9 &#160; 47 18 8 8 Managers/Directors 35 &#160; 8 &#160; 4 &#160; 15 &#160; 34 7 4 13 Executive 26 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 3 &#160; 25 4 3 4 All employees 49 &#160; 22 &#160; 8 &#160; 9 &#160; 48 21 7 8 ##TABLE_END

We believe equal access to earning potential is essential in attracting, retaining, and inspiring top talent. Our external hiring practices are based on market rates for roles, experience, and performance. To the same end, we do not and have not requested salary history from candidates since 2017, and we regularly benchmark our compensation against other companies, both within and outside our industry. Pay rates for all positions are routinely reviewed, supporting equitable pay across the organization. On February 1, 2021, we established an internal minimum hourly wage for our U.S. employees of $17, which increased to $20 and $23, on September 13, 2021, and November 7, 2022, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2023, in concurrence with laws in multiple municipalities in which we operate, we began proactively including pay ranges in job postings nationwide. 

Beginning in 2022, we observed Juneteenth as a paid holiday for U.S. employees to commemorate the emancipation of millions of people from slavery and our Canadian employees observed National Day for Truth and Reconciliation as a paid holiday to honor the Native children, survivors, families, and communities affected by residential schools. 

Customers 

The diversity of our employees is a key component of our success as an organization as it allows us to have a workforce that is representative of customers we serve. In June 2021, we announced the elimination of all overdraft fees across our retail deposit products for all customers. This change is an example of our &#8220;Do It Right&#8221; commitment for all customers, including those that may be financially vulnerable. In January 2022, we announced Ally CoverDraft service, which provides a no fee overdraft allowance to our qualifying customers

on debit transactions subject to a certain amount. In September 2022, we announced early direct deposit, an account feature that allows customers to access qualifying direct deposits up to two days in advance of receipt. 

Suppliers 

Our Supplier Diversity program focuses on diversity and inclusion amongst our supplier base. The program includes a proactive business strategy encouraging the use of diverse suppliers defined as those owned by U.S.-based minorities, women, LGBTQ+, veterans and those with disabilities, and small or disadvantaged businesses defined by local, state, or federal classifications. We monitor and report expenditure with diverse suppliers in two tiers: first-tier expenditure is our direct expenditure with diverse suppliers, and second-tier expenditure is indirect expenditure associated with our prime suppliers that are utilizing minority, women, LGBTQ+, veteran, disability-owned, and small or disadvantaged businesses to help support us. 

Since the program&#8217;s inception, we have created operational processes to include diverse suppliers in our bidding and contracting opportunities. This has resulted in an increase in both first-tier and second-tier diverse supplier expenditures. In 2022, we achieved $135 million of direct expenditures composed of certified Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises, Small Business, and classified diverse spend, surpassing direct diverse expenditures in 2021 by $30 million. Approximately 100 of our largest suppliers, in terms of dollars spent, participated in second-tier expenditure reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, these suppliers have allowed us to capture our second-tier diverse supplier expenditures, which provides a more holistic view of our economic impact within our communities. 

Our dedicated Supplier Diversity team assists our business lines and procurement teams in identifying a mix of diverse suppliers with the proper credentials and capabilities to adhere to our third-party risk, operational, commercial, legal and performance standards. As part of our initial supplier due diligence process, our Supplier Diversity and procurement teams partner to research qualified diverse suppliers capable of meeting our standards in Request for Proposal events. This allows us to integrate consideration of diverse business enterprises in third-party purchasing opportunities. Our comprehensive sourcing network pairs our needs with the business strengths of a diverse mix of large and small suppliers, who then may participate in our bidding and selection processes. 

In February 2022, we hosted the second-annual Supplier Diversity Symposium, which facilitated interactive breakout sessions and a fireside chat with our CEO to increase access, create connections, and explore opportunities to expand relationships with diverse suppliers. In addition to our annual Symposium, we hosted quarterly diverse supplier spotlight events as part of our ongoing commitment to supplier diversity. These events engaged diverse suppliers through interactive mock sales pitches and provided immediate coaching and feedback. As a result of this access, many of the participating diverse suppliers went on to connect with our supply chain department and business line executives to explore potential opportunities to work with us. Our Supplier Diversity Month was created in July 2021 as part of our ongoing commitment to creating access and opportunities for diverse suppliers. During 2022, we featured more than 50 diverse-owned businesses through our Supplier Diversity Symposium, quarterly spotlight events, and Supplier Diversity Month. 

Recognition 

As a reflection of our collective efforts across each of these pillars to build an inclusive culture, we were recognized by several organizations in 2022 and 2021. In 2022, Ally was named a Forbes Best Employer among large employers, which ranked us 64th out of 500 large employers. Additionally, we were recognized as a 2022 Top Workplaces USA award recipient for our people-first culture and were included in People&#8217;s 2022 Companies That Care list. We were named sixth on Newsweek&#8217;s Most Loved Workplace list in our inaugural year of qualification, and ranked first in financial services. 

In 2022, we made the Forbes&#8217; lists as a best place to work for women, veterans, new graduates, and diversity. We also were named to Diversity Inc.&#8217;s Top 50 companies for diversity list for a second consecutive year, and as a best place to work for disability inclusion by the following organizations: American Association of People with Disabilities, and Disability:IN. Additionally, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation named us a best place to work for LGBTQ+ equality, the sixth straight year we have achieved this recognition. 

Our Supplier Diversity Program was acknowledged during 2022. We received the TOP Corporations Award from the Greater Women&#8217;s Business Council and the Ally for Excellence in Supplier Diversity award from the Carolina's LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce. 

Engagement 

Sustaining high levels of employee engagement is key as we continue to build a company where our employees want to work, have purposeful careers, and feel empowered to make a difference. Throughout the year, we leverage a third-party provider to administer confidential employee surveys to provide feedback on key strengths and opportunity areas for action-taking to improve our culture. 

The following table indicates our company-wide engagement survey results as measured by our third-party provider, based on a 100-point scale, as well as our participation rates for the survey. 

##TABLE_START 2022 2021 Ally score 85 84 Financial services benchmark 76 74 Ally employee participation % (a) 73 79 ##TABLE_END

(a) The participation rate benchmark from our third-party provider decreased to 75% in 2022, compared to 80% in 2021. 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

For 2022 and 2021, our employee engagement scores were within the top 10% of all global companies that participated in the survey and at least nine points higher than the financial services industry benchmark. High levels of employee engagement help reflect a productive and healthy workforce that takes care of our customers and communities, and contribute to our employee retention rate, which was approximately 85% and 86% for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Hiring, Retention, and Learning and Development 

We make significant investments in recruitment and employee development to attract and retain top talent. Our recruitment process is vast and includes partnerships with universities, including virtual and on-campus recruiting events, online platforms, internship and rotational programs, and referral bonuses to current employees. We hold numerous programs to invest in the growth and development of our employees. Our employee base receives continuing education courses relevant to our industry through the Ally Learning Center, in addition to on-the-job training related to their function or a regulatory requirement. We offer targeted trainings for management and leadership development. We have organized a mentor-mentee program as an avenue for our employees to share knowledge, experience, and perspective and to foster the personal and professional growth of one another. Certain of our business lines offer rotational and leader development programs with the oversight and guidance of our HR business partners. 

Our performance management process is designed to promote a culture of meaningful work, ongoing feedback and coaching, and employee-owned careers. Annually, employees partner with managers to create and align performance measurements considering company-wide objectives. We encourage quarterly performance review discussions between employees and managers and require year end performance evaluations summarizing the ongoing performance, development, and career interest conversations that occurred throughout the year. Additionally, we provide a multi-rater feedback tool to solicit additional perspectives on employee contributions and a more holistic picture of employee performance and leadership. 

We encourage internal mobility among our employees, contributing to 22% and 26% of our existing eligible workforce that has been with Ally for at least one year receiving promotions or taking on new roles during the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Our deliberate focus on mobility supports our ongoing retention efforts for top talent across the organization. The retention rate for employees that we determine to be high performers through talent planning was 94% for both years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. On a routine basis, we perform talent and succession planning to develop and retain our top talent. We also provide support for continuing education through a tuition reimbursement program, as well as student loan repayment assistance and contributions to employee&#8217;s 529 education savings plans. 

Total Rewards, Health, and Wellness 

Our compensation program offers market-competitive base pay and pay-for-performance incentives based on achieving individual and company goals. In addition, our total rewards include competitive holiday and flexible paid-time-off, a 401(k) retirement savings plan with matching and company contributions that can total up to 10% of an employee&#8217;s salary per year, as well as other benefits designed to support the personal and professional lives of our employees. Examples of these benefits include paid parental and caregiver leave, adoption and surrogacy assistance, a backup child and adult/elder care program, no-cost access to certified financial planners, and an employee assistance program. We also match employee donations to registered nonprofits subject to an annual cap and provide our employees with eight hours of voluntary-time-off to give back in the communities where we work. 

We empower our employees to act as founders with an owner&#8217;s mindset across all levels of the organization and all parts of the business which is encouraged through our shared equity program. In August 2021, we announced that all eligible employees may be awarded Ally stock annually through our discretionary #OwnIt Annual Grant Program dependent upon our financial performance and Board approval. In January 2023, for the fourth consecutive year, we awarded all active, regular Ally employees with 100 restricted stock units, up to a maximum grant date value of $5,000, and subject to a 3-year cliff vesting schedule, in recognition of our notable accomplishments and to support a founder&#8217;s mentality. This benefit provides shared equity to our employees and to further encourage the mindset of an owner, we also maintain an employee stock purchase plan that provides employees with the opportunity to purchase Ally stock at a discount. 

Supporting and valuing all our employees is central to our culture. We offer flexible health insurance options including dental and vision for our employees, as well as a pre-tax health savings account with employer contributions and reimbursement for certain eligible transportation and lodging expenses when in-network covered care is not available within 100 miles of a member&#8217;s home address. We provide life and disability benefits and manage a wellness program encouraging healthy living with financial rewards. In 2022, we announced expanded mental health benefits for our employees, their dependents, and immediate household members. This additional benefit will provide up to 16 free counseling sessions for each individual, regardless of their participation in our medical plans, to help address on-going community concerns over affordability and access to mental health care and build resiliency among our employee population. 

We continue to adapt and update protocols around COVID-19, with foremost emphasis on our employee health and safety. Changes are driven by guidance from medical experts and in alignment with the CDC. As the government takes steps to end the public health emergency declarations come May 2023, we are also updating our guidelines and protocols. For our work to prioritize employee well-being with resources, benefits, and support, we were recognized with a Nation&#8217;s Best and Brightest in Wellness award in 2022, for the sixth consecutive year.
