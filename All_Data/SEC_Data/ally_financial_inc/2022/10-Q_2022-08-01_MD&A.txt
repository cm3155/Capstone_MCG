 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Cautionary Notice about Forward-Looking Statements and Other Terms 

From time to time we have made, and in the future will make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;pursue,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;initiative,&#8221; &#8220;priorities,&#8221; or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; or &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements convey our expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, or results.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement.

&#8226; Our Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. Dealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. 

Our Automotive Finance operations include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers and automotive retailers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, supplying warehouse lines to automotive retailers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. Our dealer-centric business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. Our success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, including substantial investments in electrification by automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We remain focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon our approximately 22,400 dealer relationships. We continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with leading eCommerce platforms. We also operate Clearlane, our online direct-lending platform, which provides a digital platform for consumers seeking direct financing. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers. Additionally, we provide comprehensive automotive remarketing services, including the use of SmartAuction, our online auction platform, which efficiently supports dealer-to-dealer 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

and other commercial wholesale vehicle transactions. SmartAuction provides diversified fee-based revenue and serves as a means of deepening relationships with our dealership customers. Furthermore, our strong and expansive dealer relationships, comprehensive suite of products and services, full-spectrum financing, and depth of experience position us to evolve with future shifts in automobile technologies, including electrification. We have and continue to provide automobile financing for hybrid and battery-electric vehicles today, and are well positioned to remain a leader in automotive financing as we believe the majority of these vehicles will be sold through dealerships with whom we have an established relationship. 

The Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our previous role as a captive finance company for GM and Stellantis. The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler in evolving our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have approximately 16,000 dealer relationships, of which approximately 70% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence. 

Our Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.5 million consumers nationwide across F&#38;I and P&#38;C products. In addition, we offer F&#38;I products in Canada, where we serve more than 400 thousand consumers and are the VSC and other protection plan provider for GM Canada and VSC provider for Subaru Canada. 

As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer F&#38;I products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers&#8217; wholesale vehicle inventory and offer additional products to protect a dealer&#8217;s business including property and liability coverage that is underwritten by a third-party carrier. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction. 

&#8226; Our Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering, and bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans originated by third parties. 

Through our direct-to-consumer channel, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held-for-sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held-for-investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with BMC, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, BMC conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally&#8217;s digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. This partnership with BMC limits operational volatility as the mortgage industry continues to evolve in the current interest rate environment. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we originated $2.6 billion of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel. During 2018, we made a strategic equity investment in the parent of BMC (BMC Holdco) that was subsequently increased in 2019 and 2020. This investment is recognized as a nonmarketable equity investment within other assets of our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and is included in Corporate and Other. Refer to the Market Risk section of this MD&#38;A for more information. 

Through the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we purchased $1.6 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held-for-investment. 

The combination of our direct-to-consumer strategy and bulk portfolio purchase program provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers. 

&#8226; Our Corporate Finance operations primarily provide senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. While there continues to be a significant level of liquidity and competition in the middle-market lending space, we have continued 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

to prudently grow our lending portfolio with a focus on a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, including a greater focus on asset-based loans and priority, first-out revolving lines of credit. We seek markets and opportunities where our clients require customized, highly structured, and time-sensitive financing solutions. Our corporate-finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans. Our focus is on businesses owned by private-equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, refinancing and recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, growth, turnarounds, and debtor-in-possession financings. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with facilities to partially fund their direct-lending activities. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including financials, services, manufacturing, distribution, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include healthcare, technology/venture finance, defense and aerospace, and transportation and logistics. We also provide a healthcare-based commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. Other smaller complementary product offerings that help strengthen our reputation as a full-spectrum provider of financing solutions for borrowers include selectively offering second-out loans on certain transactions and issuing letters of credit through Ally Bank. 

&#8226; Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate FTP and treasury ALM activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of FHLB and FRB stock as well as other strategic investments, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, CRA loans and related investments, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. 

Corporate and Other includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest&#8217;s clearing broker. 

Information related to our point-of-sale financing business, Ally Lending, is also included within Corporate and Other. Ally Lending currently serves medical and home improvement service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a digital application process at point-of-sale. The home improvement segment, which was launched in the second quarter of 2020, had originations of $343 million during the second quarter of 2022 and now represents approximately 58% of new originations, and is expected to grow. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, and expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet the financial needs of our customers. 

Additionally, beginning in December 2021 with the acquisition of Fair Square, which we rebranded as Ally Credit Card, financial information related to our credit card business is included within Corporate and Other. The acquisition provides us with a scalable, digital-first credit card platform, and advances our evolution as a leading digital consumer bank. Ally Credit Card features leading-edge technology, and a proprietary, analytics-based underwriting model. We believe the addition of credit card to our suite of products enhances our ability to grow and deepen both new and existing customer relationships.

(a) The ratios were based on average assets and average total equity using an average daily balance methodology. 

(b) The common dividend payout ratio was calculated using basic earnings per common share. 

We earned net income from continuing operations of $482 million and $1.1 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $899 million and $1.7 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, results were favorably impacted by higher financing revenue and other interest income within the automotive and credit card loan portfolios, as well as lower interest expense. These items were more than offset by higher provision for credit losses, unrealized losses on equity securities, and noninterest expense for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income increased $217 million and $538 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. Consumer automotive revenue increased as higher average consumer assets contributed to the increase in revenue resulting from growth in the used-vehicle portfolio, primarily through franchised dealers, as well as increases in portfolio yields. The increases were also impacted by the acquisition of Ally Credit Card in December 2021. We experienced lower interest expense for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021, driven by market and industry dynamics that drove a decrease in our funding costs, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. Within our Automotive Finance operations, total net operating lease revenue decreased $125 million and $146 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, driven by an increase 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

in depreciation expense resulting from a declining impact of downward adjustments to the rate of depreciation enacted in prior years, as well as a decrease in remarketing performance due to the continued shift in off-lease disposition channel mix with lessee and dealer buyouts increasing from the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross operating lease revenue driven by higher vehicle prices. 

We incurred other loss on investments of $124 million and $119 million for the three months and six months ended, June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to gains of $65 million and $188 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily driven by $137 million and $202 million of unrealized equity mark-to-market losses, as compared to results from the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, which included $19 million and $36 million of unrealized gains. Additionally, the decreases were also impacted by elevated realized capital gains from equity securities during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, that did not reoccur. 

Other income, net of losses decreased $97 million and $81 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021, were primarily due to $81 million in upward adjustments related to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value during the three months ended June 30, 2021, that did not reoccur, driven primarily by an investment in one entity for which there was a subsequent funding round at a higher valuation during the period, resulting in an observable price change. Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

The provision for credit losses increased $336 million and $516 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases in provision for credit losses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily driven by higher net charge-offs as credit continued to normalize during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, as well as reserve reductions during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, associated with improvements to the macroeconomic environment following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, provision expense for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, includes net charge-offs and portfolio growth related to Ally Credit Card, following our acquisition in December 2021. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Noninterest expense was $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were driven by increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite and expand our digital capabilities and portfolio of products. 

We recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of $152 million and $343 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $143 million and $354 million for the same periods in 2021. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to adjustments to the valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards, partially offset by the tax effects of a decrease in pretax earnings. The decrease in income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to the tax effects of a decrease in pretax earnings, partially offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards.

(a) Includes net remarketing gains of $50 million and $100 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $128 million and $192 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Our Automotive Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $600 million and $1.3 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $917 million and $1.7 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, the decreases were primarily due to higher provision for credit losses, higher net depreciation expense on operating lease assets, and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher financing revenue. 

Consumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $74 million and $125 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. Higher average consumer assets contributed to the increase in revenue resulting from growth in the used-vehicle portfolio, primarily through franchised dealers, as well as increases in portfolio yields. 

Commercial loan financing revenue increased $17 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, and decreased $15 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was driven by lower outstanding floorplan assets as a result of lower new vehicle inventories due to continued vehicle supply constraints. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to higher yields from higher benchmark interest rates. 

Interest expense was $380 million and $702 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $382 million and $795 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to market and industry dynamics, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates and other funding costs.

Total noninterest expense increased $45 million and $92 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily due to higher overhead expense, as well as compensation and benefits expense, which increased primarily due to higher headcount to support the growth of the business. 

Total net operating lease revenue decreased $125 million and $146 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. We recognized remarketing gains of $50 million and $100 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to remarketing gains of $128 million and $192 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, while depreciation expense on operating lease assets increased $59 million and $99 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The decreases in net operating lease revenue were primarily driven by an increase in depreciation expense resulting from a declining impact of downward adjustments to the rate of depreciation enacted in prior years, as well as a decrease in remarketing performance due to the continued shift in off-lease disposition channel mix with lessee and dealer buyouts increasing from the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross operating lease revenue driven by higher vehicle prices. Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

The provision for credit losses increased $251 million and $377 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases in provision for credit losses were primarily driven by higher net charge-offs during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, as well as reserve reductions during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, associated with improvements to the macroeconomic environment following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, provision increased for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, from reserve increases associated with portfolio growth in our consumer automotive portfolio. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses.

(c) Includes the effects of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges, which is included within Corporate and Other. Excluding the impact of hedging activities, the yield was 6.85% and 6.80% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and 6.92% and 6.91% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

(d) Includes the effects of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges, which is included within Corporate and Other. Excluding the impact of hedging activities, the yield was 3.27% and 3.02% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and 2.48% and 2.55% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

(e) Consists primarily of automotive dealer term loans, including those to finance dealership land and buildings, and dealer fleet financing. 

(f) Yield includes net gains on the sale of off-lease vehicles of $50 million and $100 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $128 million and $192 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. Excluding these gains and losses on sale, the yield was 4.79% and 4.94% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and 6.71% and 6.32% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans, excluding the impact of hedging activities, increased approximately 12 and 4 basis points for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, relative to the same periods in 2021, due to higher benchmark interest rates. We expect yields on retail automotive loans to continue to rise during the remainder of 2022, consistent with market interest rates. 

Our portfolio yield for investment in operating leases, net, including net gains on the sale of off-lease vehicles, decreased approximately 501 and 336 basis points to 6.7% and 6.8% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to 11.7% and 10.2% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. These declines were due to a decrease in remarketing performance due to the continued shift in off-lease disposition channel mix with lessee and dealer buyouts increasing from the prior year. The shift in off-lease vehicle disposition mix is expected to continue in the near term and may limit our ability to optimize remarketing proceeds .

Total consumer automotive loan and operating lease originations increased $314 million and $1.7 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases were primarily driven by continued momentum in used-vehicle lending and higher financed transaction amounts, partially offset by decreased application flow. 

We have included origination metrics by loan term and FICO&#174; Score within this MD&#38;A.

Originations with a FICO&#174; Score of less than 620 (considered nonprime) represented 10% and 9% of total consumer loan and operating lease originations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 9% for both the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. Consumer loans and operating leases with FICO&#174; Scores of less than 540 comprised 2% and 1% of total originations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 1% for both the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. Nonprime applications are subject to more stringent underwriting criteria (for example, minimum payment-to-income ratio, maximum debt-to-income ratio, and maximum amount financed), and our nonprime loan portfolio generally does not include any loans with a term of 76 months or more. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $9.0 billion, or approximately 11.0%, of our total consumer automotive loans at June 30, 2022, as compared to $8.8 billion, or approximately 11.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2021.

During the first quarter of 2022, we expanded our relationship with Carvana, a leading e-commerce platform for buying and selling used vehicles. Specifically, we increased our committed facility from a maximum of $4.0 billion to a maximum of $5.0 billion to support our continued efforts to optimize risk-adjusted returns. This commitment is effective for 365 days. As part of the agreement, we purchase finance receivables meeting certain prescribed eligibility requirements on a periodic basis from Carvana. We also have the opportunity to purchase additional contracts from Carvana on an ad-hoc basis that may fall outside of the prescribed eligibility requirements utilized within the recurring pools. The risk profile of the contractual purchases is similar to the volume we fund through other dealer-facing channels. All the finance receivables purchased through this channel are used vehicles, and are included in the Growth channel in our consumer origination metrics. To date, finance receivables purchased from Carvana have exhibited (1) favorable delinquency and loss performance, as compared to original expectations assumed at the time of purchase and (2) consistent delinquency and loss performance compared to loans with similar credit characteristics acquired through our indirect dealer channel. Consumer assets sourced from Carvana represented 6% of our total consumer portfolio as of June 30, 2022.

Commercial Wholesale Financing Volume 

The following table presents the percentage of average balance of our commercial wholesale floorplan finance receivables, in dollars, by product type and by channel. 

Average balance Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, ($ in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Used vehicles 48 &#160; % 31 % 49 &#160; % 26 % Stellantis new vehicles 30 &#160; 31 29 &#160; 33 GM new vehicles 15 &#160; 21 15 &#160; 24 Growth new vehicles 7 &#160; 17 7 &#160; 17 Total 100 &#160; % 100 % 100 &#160; % 100 % Total commercial wholesale finance receivables $ 11,372 &#160; $ 10,825 $ 11,482 &#160; $ 13,205 

Average commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding increased $547 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022, and decreased $1.7 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily driven by an increase in average vehicle values due to limited inventory levels experienced throughout the industry. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to lower dealer inventory levels, driven by strong consumer demand for vehicles that outpaced lower automotive production levels due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, which was partially offset by an increase in average vehicle values. The decline was also impacted by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances. While the severity and duration of these supply chain disruptions is not currently clear, we anticipate this will continue to limit the growth in commercial wholesale finance receivables throughout 2022 commensurate with lower dealer inventory levels. 

During the first quarter of 2022, we increased Carvana&#8217;s commercial line of credit to a total of $3.0 billion and concurrently entered into a participation agreement with two third parties for a total of $1.0 billion. The temporary increase and related participation agreement is scheduled to terminate in the third quarter of 2022. The credit line will revert to $2.0 billion thereafter, with a scheduled maturity in the first quarter of 2023. The line of credit represents a commitment to fund Carvana&#8217;s wholesale floorplan financing of used vehicles and is consistent in form and structure with our other wholesale floorplan financing arrangements. At June 30, 2022, Carvana&#8217;s wholesale floorplan assets outstanding balance was $1.0 billion, inclusive of the third-party participation agreement. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Other Commercial Automotive Financing 

We also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, these loans generally include cross-collateral and cross-default provisions. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans decreased $668 million and $792 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, to an average of $4.8 billion for both the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022.

(a) Includes interest expense of $11 million and $23 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $14 million and $28 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

(b) Includes net unrealized losses on equity securities of $136 million and $197 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and net unrealized gains on equity securities of $20 million and $31 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

(c) Management uses a combined ratio as a primary measure of underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is indicated by a combined ratio under 100% and is calculated as the sum of all incurred losses and expenses (excluding interest and income tax expense) divided by the total of premiums and service revenues earned and other income (excluding interest, dividends, and other investment activity). 

Our Insurance operations incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $122 million and $109 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to income of $87 million and $228 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases were primarily driven by lower net investment gains of $188 million and $300 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2021. 

Insurance premiums and service revenue earned was $280 million and $560 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $278 million and $558 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. This resulted from increases of $3 million and $12 million in earned revenue from our F&#38;I products for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower earned premiums from our P&#38;C business reflecting lower industry-wide dealer vehicle inventory levels as a result of continuing supply chain challenges, partially offset by higher earned revenue from other dealer-related products. 

Other loss on investments, net was $127 million and $141 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to other gain on investments, net of $61 million and $159 million for the same periods in 2021. The decreases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily attributable to elevated realized capital gains from equity securities during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, that did not reoccur. Additionally, results are inclusive of $136 million and $197 million of unrealized equity mark-to-market losses, as compared to results from the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, which included $20 million and $31 million, respectively, of unrealized gains driven by broader equity market performance. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $89 million and $147 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $74 million and $137 million for the same periods in 2021. The increases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily driven by higher weather-related losses on our vehicle inventory insurance business, partially offset by lower GAP claims as a result of higher used vehicle values. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $13 million and $39 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The change was primarily due to an increase in insurance commission expense, commensurate with higher earned premiums from our F&#38;I products and higher incentive program expense driven by favorable F&#38;I loss performance. Acquisition and underwriting expenses also increased as a result of higher compensation and benefits expense and business support costs. 

Our combined ratio was 106.0% and 101.3% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 96.7% and 93.1% for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases were primarily driven by lower P&#38;C inventory exposure as a result of lower industry dealer inventory levels, higher weather-related losses and higher acquisition and underwriting expense. In April 2022, we renewed our annual excess of loss reinsurance agreement and continue to utilize this coverage for our vehicle inventory insurance to manage our risk of weather-related loss. 

Premium and Service Revenue Written 

The following table summarizes premium and service revenue written by product, net of premiums ceded to reinsurers. VSC and GAP revenue are earned over the life of the service contract on a basis proportionate to the anticipated loss pattern.

(a) Other financial and insurance products include VMCs, ClearGuard, and other ancillary products. 

(b) P&#38;C insurance include vehicle inventory insurance and dealer ancillary products. 

Insurance premiums and service revenue written was $262 million and $527 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $301 million and $634 million for the same periods in 2021. The decreases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily due to lower F&#38;I volume commensurate with lower industry retail sales. P&#38;C inventory insurance premiums written declined during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, driven by lower dealer vehicle inventory levels as supply chain disruptions continue. The decrease in P&#38;C inventory insurance premiums written was partially offset by growth in other P&#38;C dealer products. 

Cash and Investments 

A significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.

Our Mortgage Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $6 million and $17 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $0 million and $23 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily driven by higher net financing revenue and other interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and an increase in noninterest expense. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily driven by lower net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and increases in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses, offset by higher net financing revenue and other interest income. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $56 million and $109 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $23 million and $46 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases in net financing revenue and other interest income for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily due to higher asset balances and lower prepayment activity, driven by a higher interest rate environment, which resulted in lower premium amortization. Premium amortization was $5 million and $14 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $24 million and $59 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, we purchased $808 million and $1.6 billion of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties, respectively, compared to $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. We originated $300 million and $984 million of mortgage loans held-for-investment during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $1.4 billion and $2.2 billion during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Gain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $4 million and $18 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $19 million and $55 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases were attributable to lower margins and lower volume on direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider. We originated $584 million and $1.6 billion of loans held-for-sale during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $809 million and $1.8 billion during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

The provision for credit losses increased $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily driven by reserve increases associated with portfolio growth, as total assets grew 38% from the prior year, which more than offset net recoveries for the period. Refer to the Risk Managemen t section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses.

The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to the business continuing to scale.

Our Corporate Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $60 million and $124 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to income earned of $95 million and $148 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, were primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses and lower other revenue, partially offset by higher interest income, which was driven by asset growth. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $77 million and $160 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $77 million and $148 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to higher average assets from continued growth in the portfolio. This was partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher benchmark interest rates. 

Other revenue decreased $14 million and $16 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases were primarily due to declines in net investment gains and syndication income. 

The provision for credit losses increased $21 million and $14 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases in provision for credit losses were primarily driven by higher provisions on specific exposures, as we continue to see credit normalization. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Corporate and Other earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $90 million and $123 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a loss of $57 million and $70 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in income was primarily driven by an increase in financing revenue and other interest income resulting from an increase in interest and fees on finance receivables and an increase in loans and dividends from investment securities as well as lower interest expense. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses during the six months ended June 30, 2022, and the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2021. 

Total financing revenue and other interest income was $276 million and $499 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $126 million and $234 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases were primarily driven by financing revenue from Ally Credit Card, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases were also driven by the impacts of a higher interest rate environment on the investment securities portfolio and hedging activities. 

Total interest expense decreased $61 million and $134 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases were primarily driven by market and industry dynamics that drove a decrease in our funding costs, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. 

Total other revenue decreased $19 million and $11 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases were primarily driven by upward adjustments related to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, which did not reoccur during the same periods in 2022. Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. This decrease was partially offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2021. 

The provision for credit losses increased $64 million and $121 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, the increase in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by portfolio growth and higher net charge-offs within Ally Lending. Additionally, provision expense for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, includes net charge-offs and portfolio growth related to Ally Credit Card, following our acquisition in December 2021. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Noninterest expense decreased $19 million and increased $74 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, as compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2022, was driven by a decrease in compensation and benefit related expenses. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was driven by increased compensation and benefits expense, as well as incremental costs associated with Ally Credit Card. 

Total assets were $41.7 billion as of June 30, 2022, compared to $50.8 billion as of June 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in our total cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by growth in consumer loans associated with Ally Lending and Ally Credit Card. Additionally, as of June 30, 2022, the amortized cost of the legacy mortgage portfolio was $322 million, compared to $429 million at June 30, 2021, which also contributed to the decrease.

Risk Management 

Managing the risk/reward trade-off is a fundamental component of operating our businesses, and all employees are responsible for managing risk. We use multiple layers of defense to identify, monitor, and manage current and emerging risks. 

&#8226; Business lines &#160;&#8212; Responsible for owning and managing all of the risks that emanate from their risk-taking activities, including business units and support functions. 

&#8226; Independent risk management &#8212; Operates independent of the business lines and is responsible for establishing and maintaining our risk-management framework and promulgating it enterprise-wide. Independent risk management also provides an objective, critical assessment of risks and&#8212;through oversight, effective challenge, and other means&#8212;evaluates whether Ally remains aligned with its risk appetite. 

&#8226; Internal audit &#8212; Provides its own independent assessments regarding the quality of our loan portfolios as well as the effectiveness of our risk management, internal controls, and governance. Internal audit includes Audit Services and the Loan Review Group. 

Our risk-management framework is overseen by the RC of our Board. The RC sets the risk appetite across our company while risk-oriented management committees, the executive leadership team, and our associates identify and monitor current and emerging risks and manage those risks within our risk appetite. Our primary types of risks include credit risk, insurance/underwriting risk, liquidity risk, market 

risk, business/strategic risk, reputation risk, operational risk, information technology/cybersecurity risk, compliance risk, and conduct risk. For more information on our risk management process, refer to the Risk Management MD&#38;A section of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In addition to the primary risks that we manage, climate-related risk has been identified as an emerging risk. Climate-related risk refers to the risk of loss or change in business activities arising from climate change and represents a transverse risk that could impact other risks within Ally&#8217;s risk-management framework, such as credit risk from negatively impacted borrowers, reputation risk from increased stakeholder concerns, and operational risk from physical climate risks.

(a) Includes a liability of $501 million and $37 million associated with fair value hedging adjustments at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 19 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

(b) Includes $322 million and $368 million of consumer mortgage loans in our legacy mortgage portfolio at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

(c) Represents the current balance of conforming mortgages originated directly to the held-for-sale portfolio. 

(d) Represents the current unpaid principal balance of outstanding loans based on our customary representation and warranty provisions. 

The risks inherent in our loan and operating lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing prices, unemployment levels, real personal income, and their impact on our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain most of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in stressed macroeconomic scenarios. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk. 

Credit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the RC, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis. 

To mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to periodic stress tests, which include economic scenarios whose severity mirrors those developed and distributed by the FRB to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Another important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio. 

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical, current, and anticipated trends. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Additionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, changes to contractual interest rates, and principal forgiveness. 

Furthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, lending arrangements, and certain cash balances. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 19 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. As measured by GDP, the U.S. economy has contracted in the first half of 2022, but the unemployment rate has remained at 3.6% as of June 30, 2022. Sales of new light vehicles have been adversely affected primarily by supply chain difficulties and slowed to an average annual rate of 13.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Sales of new light motor vehicles remain below the pre-pandemic annual pace of 17.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, driving an increase in used vehicle values, as further described in the section below titled Operating Lease Vehicle Terminations and Remarketing . Additionally, used vehicle values may also be impacted by availability, price of new vehicles, or changes in customer preferences. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations, as well as point-of-sale personal lending through Ally Lending. Additionally, beginning in December 2021 with the acquisition of Ally Credit Card, financial information related to our credit card business is included within Corporate and Other. Credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio was impacted by fiscal and monetary stimulus deployed by governmental authorities to partially mitigate the adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic on households and businesses. 

The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.0% and 11.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we continued to experience credit performance normalization in our consumer automotive portfolio from prior year COVID-19 pandemic lows in delinquency and loss statistics, and anticipate this credit normalization trend to continue. We have been consistent in underwriting new originations and remain within our approved risk appetite. For information on our consumer credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(a) Includes nonaccrual TDR loans of $700 million and $714 million at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

(b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. 

(c) Certain finance receivables and loans are included in fair value hedging relationships. Refer to Note 19 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

(d) Includes outstanding CSG loans of $9.2 billion and $8.6 billion at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, and RV loans of $656 million and $763 million at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

(e) Excludes finance receivables of $7 million at both June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, for which we have elected the fair value option. 

Total consumer finance receivables and loans increased $5.5 billion at June 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021. The increase consists of $3.4 billion of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, $1.2 billion of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and $785 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans. The increase was primarily due to an increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, primarily related to continued momentum in our used-vehicle lending. Growth within the consumer mortgage and consumer other finance receivables and loans portfolios was primarily due to loan originations, which outpaced portfolio runoff. 

Total consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at June 30, 2022, decreased $19 million to $1.2 billion from December 31, 2021. The decrease in our consumer mortgage portfolio was driven by strong consumer payment activity due to favorable macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 1.1% and 1.2% at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Total consumer TDRs outstanding at June 30, 2022, decreased $160 million since December 31, 2021, to $2.0 billion. Results primarily reflect a $161 million decrease in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. The level of consumer TDRs is continuing to stabilize, as we continue to offer deferrals through our established risk management policies and practices to customers subsequent to a COVID-19 deferral, where the loan modification in connection with other factors resulted in a TDR classification. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Consumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more increased $384 million to $2.1 billion at June 30, 2022, compared to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021, which was driven by credit normalization following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held for sale during the period for each loan category. 

Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $128 million and $262 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a net recovery of $2 million and a net charge off of $102 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio increased by $113 million and $129 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, driven by credit normalization following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net charge-offs in our consumer other portfolio increased primarily due to the acquisition of Ally Credit Card, which we acquired in December 2021. 

The following table summarizes total consumer loan originations for the periods shown. Total consumer loan originations include loans classified as finance receivables and loans held-for-sale during the period.

(a) Excludes bulk loan purchases associated with our Mortgage Finance operations, and includes $584 million and $1.6 billion of loans originated as held-for-sale for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $809 million and $1.8 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. 

(b) Includes acquired loans related to our Ally Lending business, for which we have elected the fair value option measurement. 

(c) Excludes credit card loans which are revolving in nature. 

Total consumer loan originations increased $211 million and $2.1 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increases for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021, were driven by higher financed transaction amounts, and partially offset by decreased application flow in the consumer automotive portfolio. This was partially offset by decreased loan originations within the consumer mortgage portfolio, due to a higher interest rate environment.

Commercial Criticized Exposure 

Finance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are reported as criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss. 

Total criticized exposures increased $58 million from December 31, 2021, to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2022, and represented 7.3% of total commercial finance receivables and loans at both June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Special Mention loans within our Corporate Finance operations.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. The CECL standard introduced a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized costs. In contrast to the previous incurred loss model, CECL requires credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost to be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of assets. 

Under CECL, our modeling processes incorporate the following considerations: 

&#8226; a single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process; 

&#8226; a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period; and 

&#8226; data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period available, which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period. 

Our quantitatively determined allowance under CECL is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, our consumer automotive allowance for loan losses is most sensitive to state-level unemployment rates. Our process for determining the allowance for loan losses considers a 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

borrower&#8217;s willingness and ability to pay and considers other factors, including loan modification programs. In addition to our quantitative allowance for loan losses, we also incorporate qualitative adjustments that may relate to idiosyncratic risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results such as the impacts associated with COVID-19 and other macroeconomic uncertainty. We also monitor model performance, using model error and related assessments, and we may incorporate qualitative reserves to adjust our quantitatively determined allowance if we observe deterioration in model performance. Additionally, we perform a sensitivity analysis of our allowance utilizing varying macroeconomic scenarios, as described further within Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Allowance for Credit Losses within the MD&#38;A in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Through June 30, 2022, forecasted economic variables incorporated into our quantitative allowance processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations, which included (but were not limited to) the following: the unemployment rate declining to approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, before reverting to the historical mean of approximately 6% by the second quarter of 2025, deceleration of GDP growth as measured on a quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis, and new light vehicle sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis peaking to approximately 16 million units in the second quarter of 2023, before reverting to the historical mean of approximately 15 million by the second quarter of 2025. We continue to use our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust management reserve levels to account for ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic environment, including the global supply chain and manufacturing challenges, workforce participation, inflation, and other complexities stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and current geopolitical environment that could adversely impact frequency of loss and LGD. Our overall allowance for loan losses increased $149 million from the prior quarter to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2022, representing 2.7% as a percentage of total finance receivables as of both June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

The allowance for consumer loan losses as of June 30, 2022, increased $316 million compared to June 30, 2021, reflecting an increase of $231 million in the consumer other allowance, along with an increase of $83 million in the consumer automotive allowance. The increase in the consumer other allowance was primarily driven by the establishment of reserves related to the Ally Credit Card acquisition, as well as continued growth in Ally Lending and Ally Credit Card. The increase in our consumer automotive allowance was primarily driven by portfolio growth. 

The allowance for commercial loan losses as of June 30, 2022, increased $8 million compared to June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by reserve increases within our Corporate Finance operations as a result of higher specific reserves, partially offset by reserve declines associated with continued improvements to the macroeconomic environment following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(a) Excludes $2 million of provision for credit losses related to our reserve for unfunded commitments during both the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022. 

The provision for consumer credit losses increased $305 million and $468 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in provision for consumer credit losses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily driven by higher net charge-offs as credit continued to normalize during the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, reserve reductions during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021, associated with improvements to the macroeconomic environment following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reserve increases associated with portfolio growth in our consumer automotive portfolio. Additionally, provision expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022, includes net charge-offs and portfolio growth related to Ally Credit Card, following our acquisition in December 2021. 

The provision for commercial credit losses increased $29 million and $46 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, the increase in provision for commercial credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases associated with portfolio growth, as well as higher provisions on specific exposures, within our Corporate Finance operations.

Market Risk 

Our financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held-for-sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables, such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, off-lease vehicle prices, and other equity investments. 

The impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk and can affect interest rate sensitivities and cash flows when compared to our expectations. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 

The fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 

We are also exposed to foreign-currency risk primarily from Canadian denominated assets and liabilities. We enter into foreign currency hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk. 

We also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. 

In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other nonmarketable equity investments without readily determinable fair market values, which may cause volatility in our earnings. This includes our investment in BMC Holdco as described in the section above titled Primary Business Lines. During 2021, we sold a portion of this investment for proceeds of $45 million and realized a gain of $38 million. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our remaining investment in BMC Holdco was $156 million, reflecting cumulative upward adjustments of $136 million since acquisition. In May 2021, BMC Holdco entered into a merger agreement with Aurora Acquisition Corp. (Aurora) that provides for our remaining investment in BMC Holdco to be converted into publicly traded common stock of the entity surviving the merger. The merger agreement has a stated termination date of September 30, 2022. If the merger agreement is terminated or renegotiated at a lower implied valuation&#8212;whether due to evolving market conditions affecting the mortgage industry and fintech companies, risks related to BMC Holdco and Aurora, or other factors&#8212;our investment could be adversely impacted perhaps to a significant degree. Such an adverse effect could also occur if the merger is consummated at the implied valuation pursuant to the current agreement and the publicly

traded common stock price of the surviving entity subsequently declines. Refer to the section titled Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding risk associated with the valuation of our nonmarketable equity investments and Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded $1.2 billion and $2.8 billion of net unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities, respectively, primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. These unrealized losses are recorded in other comprehensive income of our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, and are generally not realized unless we decide to sell the securities prior to their stated maturity date. If held until maturity, we would recapture the par value of the securities and not realize any losses associated with changes in interest rates. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, management determined that there were no expected credit losses for securities in an unrealized loss position. Refer to Note 7 and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

The composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis. Refer to Note 19 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

LIBOR Transition 

In recognition of the significance of LIBOR cessation, in July 2018, Ally formed an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program that devotes numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. Our program spans impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition, while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers, products and instruments, and counterparty exposures. Through this program, we continue to plan for and guide the transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, and evaluate the impacts and potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties, financial forecasts, operational processes, technology, modeling, and vendor relationships. Our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our Board through the RC and certain executive committees, including the ALCO and the ERMC. For a more detailed discussion of our transition away from LIBOR, refer to the section titled Risk Management&#8212;LIBOR Transition in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We continue to make progress on our transition efforts, including the development of new products and agreements that utilize alternative reference rates, such as Prime and SOFR. We continue to engage our commercial automotive dealer customers with transitioning their existing wholesale floorplan financing agreements from LIBOR to Prime as appropriate. Additionally, we continue to reduce our LIBOR exposure through other strategic actions. For example, during 2021, we executed the sale of a portion of our adjustable-rate mortgage loans that were tied to LIBOR, and redeemed our Series 2 TRUPS with an interest rate linked to LIBOR and replaced these regulatory capital instruments with new preferred stock referencing treasury rates. We also advanced our efforts of transitioning existing bilateral commercial automotive lending arrangements from LIBOR to alternative rates, commenced direct-to-consumer mortgage lending in our held-for-investment channel using SOFR, and commenced originating corporate-finance loans using SOFR. In alignment with guidance from U.S. banking regulators, we also updated our policies and procedures and established enhanced governance to adhere to safe-and-sound practices with regard to new LIBOR contracts and existing LIBOR exposures beyond December 31, 2021, and are planning to transition our remaining exposure to alternative rates prior to the cessation of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors, which will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. 

Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments. 

We prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing assumptions. 

Simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates. 

The net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. We test a number of alternative rate scenarios, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months is expected to increase by $751 million if interest rates remain unchanged due to expected increases in the federal funds rate, resulting in a short-end-led flattening of the yield curve. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

The following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 

June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Gradual (a) Instantaneous Gradual (a) Instantaneous Change in interest rates ($ in millions) ($ in millions) +200 basis points $ 43 &#160; $ (162) $ 2 $ (169) 

+100 basis points 

26 &#160; (79) 16 (37) -25 basis points (b) (5) 26 &#160; (9) (23) 

(a) Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months. 

(b) Our models currently assume rates do not go below zero. 

The implied forward rate curve was higher and flatter compared to December 31, 2021, as market expectations for short-term interest rates have increased more than long-term rates. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of June 30, 2022, we expect upward interest rate shock scenarios to have a moderate impact to the baseline forecast as the repricing of our asset base, combined with the benefit of our pay fixed swap position, is expected to partially offset slower prepayments and assumed repricing of our liabilities, primarily deposits. 

The exposure in the downward interest rate shock scenarios is largely driven by floating-rate assets and prepayment risk, more than offset by assumed repricing of liquid deposits. 

Our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity, which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time. 

Operating Lease Residual Risk Management 

We are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. However in certain instances, some automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating lease portfolio, net of accumulated depreciation was $10.5 billion and $10.9 billion as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $8.3 billion and $8.6 billion as of June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within the MD&#38;A in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We recognized an average gain per vehicle of $1,671 and $1,655 for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to an average gain per vehicle of and $3,684 and $2,950 for the same periods in 2021. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, decreased 15% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting the normalization of termination volume to pre-COVID-19 levels. The decrease in remarketing performance was primarily due to a shift in off-lease vehicle disposition channel mix. The remarketing channel mix for dealer and lessee buyouts increased during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to supply constraints increasing dealer demand for off-lease vehicles, as well as increases in new vehicle prices that are causing a shift in consumer preference. The shift in off-lease vehicle disposition mix is expected to 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

continue in the near term and may limit our ability to optimize remarketing proceeds; however, we expect used vehicles values to remain elevated due to continued supply challenges. As a result, we have adjusted the rate of depreciation expense to recognize lower lifetime depreciation on vehicles scheduled to terminate during 2023. We will continue to evaluate our depreciation rate for leased vehicles based on expected residual values and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease, if deemed necessary. 

Operating Lease Portfolio Mix 

We monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases. Our exposure to Stellantis vehicles represented approximately 79% and 84% of our operating lease units as of June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Climate-Related Risk 

We have identified and defined climate-related risk as an emerging risk. Pursuant to our risk-management framework, emerging risks include those that have yet to create a material impact or would only arise during stressful or unlikely circumstances. 

Climate-related risk is generally categorized into two major categories: (1) risk related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy (transition risk) and (2) risk related to the physical impacts of climate change. Transition risk considers how changes in policy, technology, and market preference could pose operational, financial and reputational risk to companies. Physical risk from climate change can be acute or chronic. Acute physical risk refers to risks that are event-driven such as increased severity of extreme weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, or floods. Chronic physical risks refer to long-term shifts in climate patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures, that may, for example, cause sea levels to rise. We manage risks related to the physical impacts of climate change through the active engagement of our business continuity program which is intended to limit disruptions during acute climate-related events. Additionally, we use excess of loss reinsurance to help mitigate risk of weather losses within our P&#38;C business for our vehicle inventory program. 

As the impacts of climate change become more evident, we have recognized (1) the importance of understanding, preparing for and taking timely preventive action against potentially material climate-change impacts, (2) increasing investor demand for consistent and comparable climate-change risk data, (3) changing federal policy focus as a result of rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and an increase in regulatory discussion about potential requirements and oversight, and (4) that Ally&#8217;s commitment to &#8220;Do It Right&#8221; extends to the conservation of environmental resources to promote a sustainable future for our customers, employees, stockholders and the communities in which we live and operate. Specifically, Ally has: 

&#8226; Defined climate-related risk as an emerging risk within our risk-management framework. 

&#8226; Appointed an Environmental Sustainability Risk Executive reporting to our Chief Risk Officer and established a sustainability office staffed with employees focused on adopting sustainability measures and developing and executing a comprehensive enterprise strategy on climate-related risks and opportunities.

Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital 

Overview 

The purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions. 

The ALCO, chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO, the ERMC, and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares monthly forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management. 

The monthly liquidity forecasts demonstrate our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under normal operating conditions throughout the forecast horizon (currently through December 2024). Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the scheduled maturity of long-term debt as of June 30, 2022. In recent years, we have become less reliant on market-based funding, reducing our exposure to disruptions in wholesale funding markets. 

Funding Strategy 

Liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, and FHLB advances. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles. 

We manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by prioritizing retail deposits, maintaining active securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB. 

Essentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for substantially all of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor these trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities. 

Our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash and unencumbered highly liquid securities. This available liquidity is held at various legal entities, and is subject to regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities.

Recent Funding Developments 

Key funding highlights from January 1, 2022, to date were as follows: 

&#8226; For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes, which provided additional liquidity at Ally Financial Inc. Additionally, we had $1.1 billion of unsecured debt mature during the six months ended June 30, 2022. 

&#8226; During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the balance of outstanding short-term and long-term FHLB advances grew by $6.8 billion and $25 million, respectively.

Deposits 

Ally Bank is a digital direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers. We offer competitive rates and fees on a full spectrum of retail deposit products, including online savings accounts, money-market demand accounts, CDs, interest-bearing checking accounts, trust accounts, and IRAs. Our primary funding source is retail deposits, which provide us with stable, low-cost funding. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. Retail deposits constituted 79% of our total funding sources at June 30, 2022. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis

(a) Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits. Additionally, other deposits also include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $2.1 billion as of both June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, $2.3 billion as of March 31, 2022, $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2021, and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2021. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2022, our total deposit base decreased $1.2 billion and we added approximately 70,000 retail deposit customers, ending with approximately 3 million retail deposit customers as of June 30, 2022. Total retail deposits decreased $3.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022, bringing the total retail deposits portfolio to $131.2 billion as of June 30, 2022. The decline during the six months ended June 30, 2022, was primarily driven by larger payments from consumers owing taxes during the second quarter of 2022&#8212;as compared to prior years&#8212;as a result of the demographic composition of our deposit customer base. This decrease was partially offset by a $2.3 billion increase in brokered deposits during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Overall, strong customer acquisition and retention rates, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to deliver a favorable funding mix. 

We continue to advance our digital capabilities and deliver incremental value to our retail deposit customers beyond competitive rates. We have continued to deliver enhancements&#8212;such as our smart savings tools&#8212;improving our customer&#8217;s digital banking experience and providing unique opportunities to organize and build their savings. On June 2, 2021, we announced the elimination of all overdraft fees across our retail deposit products for all customers. In January 2022, we announced Ally CoverDraft service, which provides a no fee overdraft allowance to our qualifying customers on debit transactions subject to a certain amount. This change is the latest example of our &#8220;Do It Right&#8221; commitment for our customers. 

We continue to be recognized for the experience and value we provide our customers. In 2021, Ally Bank&#8217;s checking account earned national Bank On certification from the CFE Fund. The organization recognized Ally&#8217;s existing checking account, which goes above and beyond CFE criteria, for providing lower- and moderate-income consumers with a safe, affordable path to join the financial mainstream and achieve financial stability. In October 2021, MONEY&#174; Magazine named Ally to its &#8220;Best Online Bank&#8221; list for the fourth consecutive year, as well as the ninth time in the past eleven years, and in June 2021, Kiplinger named Ally Bank the &#8220;Best Internet Bank&#8221; for the fifth consecutive year. In April 2022, Forbes named Ally to its &#8220;World&#8217;s Best Banks&#8221; list. For additional information on our deposit funding by type, refer to Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Securitizations and Secured Financings 

In addition to building a larger deposit base in recent years, we maintain a presence in the securitization markets to finance our automotive loan portfolios. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions due to their similarities, allow us to convert our automotive-finance receivables into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business. For additional details surrounding our securitization activities, refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the first six months of 2022, we raised $1.0 billion through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans. 

We have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of June 30, 2022, we had pledged $26.6 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $19.2 billion in total funding capacity with $13.1 billion of debt outstanding. 

At June 30, 2022, $37.6 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Unsecured Financings 

We have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed maturity dates. There were $269 million of retail term notes outstanding at June 30, 2022. The remainder of our unsecured debt is composed of institutional term debt. In June 2022, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Other Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings 

We have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of June 30, 2022, we had no debt outstanding under repurchase agreements. 

Additionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of June 30, 2022. We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of June 30, 2022. 

Guaranteed Securities 

Certain senior notes (collectively, the Guaranteed Notes) issued by Ally Financial Inc. (referred to within this section as the Parent) are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by IB Finance, a subsidiary of the Parent and the direct parent of Ally Bank, and Ally US LLC, a subsidiary of the Parent (together, the Guarantors, and the guarantee provided by each such Guarantor, the Note Guarantees). The Guarantors are primary obligors with respect to payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Parent in respect of the Guaranteed Notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture. At both June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of the Guaranteed Notes was $2.0 billion, with the last scheduled maturity to take place in 2031. 

The Note Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable Guarantor&#8217;s existing and future unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness and are subordinate to any secured indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Note Guarantees are structurally subordinate to indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables and lease obligations, and in the case of Ally Bank, its deposits) of any nonguarantor subsidiaries of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets of such subsidiaries. 

The Note Guarantees and all other obligations of the Guarantors will terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) upon a permissible sale, disposition, or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of a majority of the equity interests (including any sale, disposition or other transfer following which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the Parent), of the applicable Guarantor, or (ii) upon the discharge of the Parent&#8217;s obligations related to the Guaranteed Notes.

Cash Flows 

The following summarizes the activity reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion and $1.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Operating cash inflows were higher as compared to the prior year as our operating environment and results are returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $9.4 billion and $91 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The change was primarily due to an increase of $12.2 billion in net cash outflows related to higher originations of loans held-for-investment, driven by higher financed transaction amounts, and partially offset by decreased application flow in the consumer automotive portfolio. This was partially offset by a decrease of $8.9 billion in net cash outflows related to purchases of available-for-sale securities. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was $5.1 billion, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $3.7 billion for the same period in 2021. The change was primarily attributable to an increase of $9.9 billion in net cash inflows related to short-term borrowings and an increase of $4.0 billion in net cash inflows from the issuance of long-term debt. Refer to the above section titled Recent Funding Developments for further information. This activity was partially offset by a $3.2 billion decrease in net cash inflows related to deposits. 

Capital Planning and Stress Tests 

Under the tailoring framework described earlier in the section titled Basel Capital Framework of Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and exempted from mandated company-run capital stress testing requirements. We are also required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. Our annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a detailed description of our process for assessing capital adequacy, including a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with our risks and 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank, and will maintain sufficient capital to continue our operations by maintaining ready access to funding, meeting our obligations to creditors and other counterparties, and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. 

In January 2021, the FRB issued a final rule effective April 5, 2021, to align its capital planning and stress capital buffer requirements with the tailoring framework. Under the final rule, unless otherwise directed by the FRB in specified circumstances, Ally and other Category IV firms are generally no longer required to calculate forward-looking projections of revenues, losses, reserves, and pro forma capital levels under scenarios provided by the FRB. Each firm continues to be required, however, to provide a forward-looking analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions that are designed by the firm. In addition, for Category IV firms, the final rule updated the frequency of calculating the portion of the stress capital buffer derived from the supervisory stress test to every other year. These firms have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test&#8212;and receive a correspondingly updated stress capital buffer requirement&#8212;in a year in which they would not generally be subject to the supervisory stress test. During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm would receive an updated stress capital buffer requirement that reflects its updated planned common-stock dividends. The final rule also includes reporting and other changes consistent with the tailoring framework. Ally did not opt into the 2021 supervisory stress test but was subject to the 2022 supervisory stress test. 

We submitted our 2021 capital plan on April 5, 2021, which included planned capital distributions to common stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends and other capital actions over the nine-quarter planning horizon. On January 11, 2021, our Board authorized a stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.6 billion of our common stock from time to time from the first quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2021 subject to restrictions imposed by the FRB. On July 12, 2021, our Board authorized an increase in the maximum amount of this stock-repurchase program, from $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion. During the second quarter of 2021, we issued $1.35 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and $1.0 billion of Series C Preferred Stock, both of which qualify as additional Tier 1 capital under U.S. Basel III. The proceeds from these issuances were used to redeem a portion of the Series 2 TRUPS then outstanding. Refer to Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about these instruments and capital actions. In June 2021, we submitted an updated capital plan to the FRB reflecting these capital actions and increases in our stock-repurchase program and common-stock dividend. This updated capital plan was used by the FRB to recalculate Ally&#8217;s final stress capital buffer requirement, which was announced in August 2021 and remained unchanged at 3.5%. We submitted our 2022 capital plan to the FRB on April 5, 2022. Ally received an updated preliminary stress capital buffer requirement from the FRB in June 2022, which was determined to be 2.5% and is scheduled to become effective on October 1, 2022. 

On January 10, 2022, our Board authorized a stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from time to time from the first quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2022 subject to restrictions imposed by the FRB, and an increase in our cash dividend on common stock from $0.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 to $0.30 per share for the first quarter of 2022. Our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB&#8217;s review and our internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, accounting and regulatory considerations (including any restrictions that may be imposed by the FRB), impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be extended, modified, or discontinued at any time.

Regulatory Capital 

We became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015, although a number of its provisions&#8212;including capital buffers and certain regulatory capital deductions&#8212;were subject to phase-in periods. For further information on U.S. Basel III, refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table presents selected regulatory capital data under U.S Basel III.

(a) Tier 1 leverage ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets, which both reflect adjustments for disallowed goodwill, certain intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets. 

(b) We have elected to delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extended through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we phased in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

(c) In connection with our issuances of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in the second and third quarter of 2021, we redeemed a portion of the Series 2 TRUPS outstanding. In September 2021, we announced our intent to redeem the remaining shares of the Series 2 TRUPS outstanding without issuing a replacement capital instrument. The redemption was effectuated on October 15, 2021. Refer to Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details about our issuances of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. 

(d) Contains deferred tax assets required to be deducted from capital under U.S. Basel III.

(f) Risk-weighted assets are defined by regulation and are generally determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet exposures to various risk categories. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors).

As illustrated by the issuer ratings above, as of June 30, 2022, Ally holds an investment-grade rating from all of the respective nationally recognized rating agencies. 

Rating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices&#8212;particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We identified critical accounting estimates that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions. 

Our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; Allowance for loan losses 

&#8226; Valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals 

&#8226; Fair value of financial instruments 

&#8226; Determination of provision for income taxes 

We did not substantively change any material aspect of our methodologies and processes used in developing any of the estimates described above from what was described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting.
