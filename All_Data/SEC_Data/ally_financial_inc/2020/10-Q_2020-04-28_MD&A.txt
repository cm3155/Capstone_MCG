Cautionary Notice about Forward-Looking Statements and Other Terms 

From time to time we have made, and in the future will make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;pursue,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;initiative,&#8221; &#8220;priorities,&#8221; or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; or &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements convey our expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, or results. 

This report, including any information incorporated by reference in this report, contains forward-looking statements. We also may make forward-looking statements in other documents that are filed or furnished with the SEC. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing to investors, analysts, members of the media, or others. 

All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement. While no list of assumptions, risks, or uncertainties could be complete, some of the factors that may cause actual results or other future events or circumstances to differ from those in forward-looking statements include:

(a) 

The ratios were based on average assets and average equity using a combination of monthly and daily average methodologies. 

(b) 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we paid dividends of $0.19 per share and incurred a loss of $0.85 per share. Due to the relationship of this calculation and the net loss incurred, this ratio is not meaningful for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the common dividend payout ratio was calculated using basic earnings per common share. 

(c) 

Net interest spread represents the difference between the rate on total interest-earning assets and the rate on total interest-bearing liabilities, excluding discontinued operations for the periods shown. 

(d) 

Net yield on interest-earning assets represents net financing revenue and other interest income as a percentage of total interest-earning assets.

We have elected to delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Our Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. Dealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. 

Our Automotive Finance operations include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, supplying warehouse lines to automotive retailers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. Our dealer-focused business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. Our success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, and we are focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon the 4.5 million consumer accounts in our portfolio and 18,300 dealer relationships we have. Clearlane, our online automotive lender exchange, expands our direct-to-consumer capabilities and provides a digital platform for consumers seeking financing. Clearlane further enhances our automotive financing offerings, dealer relationships, and digital capabilities. In addition to providing a digital direct-to-consumer channel for Ally, Clearlane is a fee-based business that generates revenue by successfully referring leads to other automotive lenders. Additionally, we continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

leading eCommerce platforms. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers. 

The Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our role as a captive finance company for GM and Chrysler. The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler to converting our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have over 11,900 dealer relationships, of which approximately 88% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence. 

Our Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.4 million consumers nationwide across F&#38;I and P&#38;C products. In addition, we offer F&#38;I products in Canada, where we serve approximately 444,000 consumers and are the VSC and protection plan provider for GM Canada. As part of our focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer financial and insurance products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers&#8217; wholesale vehicle inventory. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction. 

&#8226; 

Our Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans originated by third parties, and our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering. 

Through the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage prepayments through retention modification or refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we purchased $484 million of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held-for-investment. 

Through our direct-to-consumer channel, which was introduced late in 2016, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held-for-sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held-for-investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Better.com, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, Better.com conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally&#8217;s digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we originated $729 million of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel. 

The combination of our bulk portfolio purchase program and our direct-to-consumer strategy provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers.

Our Corporate Finance operations primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. Our corporate finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans. Our primary focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, expansions, restructurings, and working capital. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct-lending activities. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including manufacturing, distribution, services, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include our Technology Finance and Healthcare verticals. Our Technology Finance vertical provides financing solutions to venture capital-backed, technology-based companies. The Healthcare vertical provides financing across the healthcare spectrum including services, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and medical devices and supplies. We also provide a commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. 

&#8226; 

Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments,

original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate FTP and treasury ALM activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of FHLB and FRB stock, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. 

Corporate and Other also includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost brokered deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest&#8217;s clearing broker. 

Additionally, beginning in October 2019 with the acquisition of Health Credit Services, financial information related to our point-of-sale consumer unsecured financing is included within Corporate and Other. The Health Credit Services business has been renamed Ally Lending and currently serves medical service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a fully digital application process that offers direct integration with health care provider systems. This platform includes providing underwriting, financing application and loan processing, servicing and collections. While we currently focus on healthcare-related lending, we believe the market outlook for point-of-sale lending provides attractive opportunities for future diversification. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet financial needs of our customers. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the acquisition of Health Credit Services. 

Significant Business Developments Related to COVID-19 

The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. COVID-19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the pandemic continue to be impossible to predict, as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence after its initial containment. Many governmental and nongovernmental authorities have directed their actions toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. These actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but, in general, have rapidly expanded in scope and intensity. Whether this response will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. 

The COVID-19 pandemic began to meaningfully affect the United States in March 2020 and is already negatively impacting us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. As time goes on, the adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant. 

During the first quarter of 2020, the most notable impacts to our results of operations were a higher provision expense for credit losses and a decline in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities. Our provision expense was $903 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $282 million for the first quarter of 2019, with the increase primarily driven by $602 million of incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment. Our loss on investments during the first quarter of 2020 included $185 million of unrealized losses as a result of changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities, compared to $70 million of unrealized gains for the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the unfavorable market conditions associated with COVID-19. 

With the spread of COVID-19 in the United States having only begun to accelerate in March 2020, our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating results-including expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfolio-is subject to meaningful uncertainty. Evidence of near-term negative effects and trends, however, has surfaced. We experienced declines of approximately 50% in our consumer automotive loan applications during the second half of March 2020, and to a slightly lesser degree, this trend has continued into April 2020, as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions. This correlates with downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers, on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles, and on used-vehicle auction activity and values. Refer to the section titled Automotive Financing Volume in this MD&#38;A for a further discussion. Declining sales and limited operations at dealers also reduced demand in our insurance operations for consumer products such as VSC and GAP protection during the second half of March 2020, and these trends and the resulting decline in written premiums have continued into April. In addition, many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers have taken measures to slow or shut down production during the pandemic, which may negatively affect dealer inventory levels and sales in the future as well as the pace of recovery when more business and household activities resume. Within our corporate finance business, we experienced higher draws on commercial customer lines of credit during the second half of March 2020, but this trend abated in April. Refinance volume and prepayment activity increased for our mortgage finance business during March 2020 and into April, while purchase volume has declined as governmental stay-at-home orders and increased economic uncertainty took hold. Even amidst substantial outflows to brokerage accounts during March 2020, our deposits franchise recorded sound growth in both retail and total deposits and a strong customer retention rate of 96% during the first quarter of 2020, and the trends into April have remained steady. 

Governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures. For example, in late March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy. One component of the 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

CARES Act is the PPP, which is a $349 billion guaranteed, unsecured loan program administered by the SBA. Loans under the PPP are fully guaranteed and may be forgiven by the SBA and can be obtained by small businesses and other entities to cover payroll costs and other expenses, including mortgage payments, rents, and utilities. In April 2020, we secured funding for approximately $830 million in loans under the PPP to our dealer customers before the initial $349 billion appropriation was exhausted. Among its other provisions, the CARES Act significantly expands eligibility for and the amount of unemployment benefits, creates and funds the advance payment of a refundable tax credit for 2020, and appropriates $500 billion to the Treasury Secretary to support U.S. air carriers and other U.S. businesses that have not otherwise received adequate economic relief as well as states and municipalities. The FRB has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well. Since March 15, 2020, these have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, such as the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, and the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. 

We have acted swiftly as well to support our customers with industry-leading programs and at the same time manage our credit risk. In our automotive finance business, existing customers may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges continuing to accrue. For new consumer automotive loans, customers are provided with the option to defer their first payment for 90 days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges accruing. For dealers with current accounts, we have offered for up to four months a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans, an increase in floorplan advance rates, a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings, and a deferral of term loan payments. In our mortgage-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to an interruption of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred but with interest continuing to accrue. In our personal-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred or finance charges continuing to accrue. For more detail and further discussion, refer to the section titled Credit Quality Indicators in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and to the section titled Risk Management within this MD&#38;A. For our deposit customers, we are waiving fees for overdrafts, excessive transactions, and expedited shipping of checks and debit cards for a 120-day period. For our brokerage customers, we are waiving fees for broker-assisted trades, paper statements, and overnight outbound check processing for 120 days. 

The degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers, counterparties, and third-party service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear. For example, while our loan-deferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to us in the future and enhance our brand and customer loyalty, these programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations at least in the near term. In addition, while the FRB&#8217;s accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers, this policy may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. 

In light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions, we continue to carefully monitor our capital and liquidity positions. On March 17, 2020, in order to support the FRB's effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy and the financial system, we announced the voluntary suspension of our stock-repurchase program for the remaining period of the first quarter and second quarter of 2020. In March 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that became effective on March 31, 2020 , and that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years their estimates of the impact of CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology, on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. As further described in Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule previously issued by banking agencies. During the first quarter of 2020, the total deferred impact on Common Equity Tier 1 capital related to our adoption of CECL was $1.2 billion . 

At March 31, 2020 , Ally and Ally Bank were &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and met all applicable regulatory capital requirements, including with Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios of 9.27% and 12.00% , respectively, compared to the minimum requirement of 4.50% . We continue to anticipate that we will have sufficient capital levels to meet all of these requirements. Additionally, we continue to access our routine short-term funding sources, such as FHLB borrowings and repurchase agreements, and to assess longer-term funding sources, such as unsecured debt and ABS where credit spreads have recently increased. In early April 2020, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.80% senior notes due 2025, which provided additional parent company liquidity, and further mitigated the risk of potential market volatility in future periods. Approximately 75% of our funding, however, is through deposits, and as described earlier in this section, we have and currently expect to maintain a strong deposits franchise. For additional discussions surrounding our capital and liquidity positions and related risks, refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in this MD&#38;A. 

The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories have necessitated changes in the way we operate our business. We activated our business continuity plan in late February 2020 and, since then, have migrated nearly all of our workforce off-site or to work-from-home arrangements to mitigate health risks. We are also carefully monitoring the activities of our vendors and other third-party service providers to manage the risks associated with any potential service disruptions. The length of time we may be required to operate under these circumstances, as well as the potential for them to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur, remains uncertain. While we have not yet experienced material adverse disruptions to our internal operations or third-party services due to the pandemic, we continue to review evolving risks and developments. To support our employees during this time, we have provided a range of financial-assistance offerings and enhanced benefits, including a $1,200 payment for those earning less than $100,000. In addition, we have pledged financial support to our communities for emergency needs, such as food, health care, emergency housing, and childcare.

We incurred a loss from continuing operations of $319 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to income earned of $375 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , results were unfavorably impacted by higher provision for credit losses, driven by economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and by lower market values of equity investments, as a result of volatility of capital markets in the current period. These items were partially offset by higher net financing revenue across our Automotive Finance and Corporate Finance operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , and the income tax benefit associated with a pre-tax loss during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . 

Net financing revenue and other interest income increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was driven by a $72 million increase in our consumer automotive financing revenue, which benefited from improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth . Additionally, we experienced a 9% decrease in total interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 , which was driven by lower market interest rates and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. Our total deposit liabilities increased $9.0 billion to $122.3 billion as of March 31, 2020 , as compared to March 31, 2019 . These items were partially offset by lower commercial automotive net financing revenue, which decreased primarily due to lower yields resulting from lower average benchmark interest rates, as well as lower outstanding floorplan assets compared to the first quarter of 2019. 

Insurance premiums and service revenue earned was $277 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , respectively, compared to $261 million for the same period in 2019 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to growth within our F&#38;I portfolio . 

Other loss on investments was $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to a gain on investment of $108 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The loss on investments for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was driven by unrealized losses as a result of changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio, partially offset by realized gains in our available-for-sale securities. The loss on investments for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , includes $185 million of unrealized losses as a result of 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis

changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities, compared to $70 million of unrealized gains in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 

The provision for credit losses was $903 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $282 million in 2019 . The increase in provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily driven by $602 million of incremental reserves associated with the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic . Additionally, provision expense increased as a result of higher provisions for specific loan exposures within our Corporate Finance operations. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Noninterest expense increased $90 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , as compared to three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was driven by increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite. We continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities. Additionally, the increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was driven by higher insurance losses and loss adjustment expense within our Insurance operations, primarily related to growth experienced in our portfolio of products, as well as noninterest expense associated with the addition of Ally Lending during the fourth quarter of 2019. 

We recognized total income tax benefit from continuing operations of $92 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $111 million of income tax expense for the same period in 2019 . The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019 , was primarily driven by the tax effects of a decrease in pretax earnings.

Excluding these gains on sale, the annualized yield would be 5.11% and 4.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , and 2019 , respectively. 

Our Automotive Finance operations incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $173 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to income earned of $329 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease was due primarily to higher provision for credit losses recognized during the first quarter of 2020, and decreased commercial financing revenue due to lower yields resulting from lower average benchmark interest rates and lower balances. The decrease was partially offset by higher consumer loan financing revenue, primarily driven by an increase in consumer loan portfolio yields and asset levels. 

Consumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $72 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to improved portfolio yields as a result of our continued focus on expanding risk-adjusted returns, and higher average consumer asset levels resulting from sustained asset growth , including a continued focus on the used-vehicle portfolio primarily through franchised dealers and growth in application volume from our dealer network. Through these actions, we continue to optimize our origination mix and achieve greater portfolio diversification. 

Commercial loan financing revenue decreased $115 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower yields resulting from lower average benchmark interest rates. The decrease was also due to lower outstanding floorplan assets compared to the first quarter of 2019. 

Interest expense was $589 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $689 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to lower market interest rates and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. 

Other income decreased 22% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to a decline in late fee income, attributed to a temporary suppression of late fees as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases. In addition, as part of our COVID-19 relief efforts, late fees were suppressed starting in the middle of March, and we expect this trend of lower late fee income to continue into the second quarter of 2020. 

Total net operating lease revenue increased $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to asset growth and favorable performance and mix in our outstanding lease portfolio. Additionally, we recognized lower remarketing gains of $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to a lower number of terminated units and lower gain per unit. The lower number of terminated units was primarily due to a temporary reduction in vehicle remarketing activity as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases and, subsequently, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which furthered the reduction in vehicle remarketing activity during the second half of March 2020, driven by reduced activity at auction sites and low dealer demand . Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

The provision for credit losses was $766 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $262 million for the same period in 2019. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the increase was primarily driven by $509 million of incremental reserves associated with the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic . Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

Other operating expenses was $346 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $321 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases.

Automotive Financing Volume 

Consumer Automotive Financing 

For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans increased 7 basis points relative to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . We set our buy rates using a granular, risk-based methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs, projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination, anticipated operating costs, and targeted return on equity. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the used-vehicle segment, primarily through franchised dealers, which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio. Commensurate with this shift in origination mix, we continue to maintain consistent, disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.5 billion , or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at March 31, 2020 , as compared to $8.4 billion , or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019 .

During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , total consumer automotive loan and operating lease originations decreased $84 million , compared to the same period in 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to decreased originations from the GM channel, which was partially offset by higher originations from the Growth channel. Over the past several years we have continued to diversify our portfolio through the Growth channel, including increased levels of used-vehicle loan volume, which we view as an attractive asset class consistent with our continued focus on obtaining appropriate risk-adjusted returns. 

Our consumer automotive lending operations have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced declines of approximately 50% in our consumer automotive loan applications during the second half of March 2020, and to a slightly lesser degree, this trend has continued into April 2020, as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers and as many consumers changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions. This trend of lower loan application activity will likely continue into at least the near future and may persist until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained, authorities cease curbing household and business activity, and consumer and business confidence recover. 

We have included origination metrics by loan term and FICO&#174; Score within this MD&#38;A.

Unscored are primarily CSG contracts with business entities that have no FICO&#174; Score. 

Originations with a FICO&#174; Score of less than 620 (considered nonprime) represented 11% of total consumer loan and operating lease originations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to 10% for three months ended March 31, 2019 . Consumer loans and operating leases with FICO&#174; Scores of less than 540 continued to compose only 1% of total originations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . Nonprime applications that are not automatically declined by our proprietary credit-scoring models for risk reasons are manually reviewed and decisioned by an experienced underwriting team. Nonprime applications are subject to more stringent underwriting criteria (for example, minimum payment-to-income ratio and vehicle mileage, and maximum amount financed), and our nonprime loan portfolio generally does not include any loans with a term of 76 months or more.

Average commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased $4.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to same period in 2019 . The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market , partially offset by higher average vehicle prices. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales&#8212;all of which can influence future wholesale balances. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances during 2020. For example, beginning in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers have taken measures to slow or shut down production. Additionally, there have been a number of jurisdictions where governments have acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers, and many consumers and businesses have changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions. It is not currently clear how long these trends may persist, and what impact these factors may have on our dealer customers or their levels of vehicle inventory. 

Other Commercial Automotive Financing 

We also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, these loans generally include cross-collateral and cross-default provisions. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans decreased 4% to $5.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 .

Management uses a combined ratio as a primary measure of underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is indicated by a combined ratio under 100% and is calculated as the sum of all incurred losses and expenses (excluding interest and income tax expense) divided by the total of premiums and service revenues earned and other income. 

Our Insurance operations incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $105 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to income of $145 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily driven by $182 million of net unrealized losses on investments within our equity securities portfolio, primarily as a result of unfavorable market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to net unrealized gains of $65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 

Insurance premiums and service revenue earned was $277 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $261 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to growth within our F&#38;I portfolio . 

Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $74 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $59 million for the same period in 2019 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily driven by higher weather-related losses , higher VSC losses, and higher vehicle inventory insurance nonweather losses. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to an increase in insurance commissions expense, driven by growth in our F&#38;I portfolio. Higher weather losses and expenses drove an increase in the combined ratio to 91.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to 85.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . In April 2020, we renewed our annual reinsurance program and continue to utilize this coverage to manage our risk of weather-related loss.

Insurance premiums and service revenue written was $317 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $305 million in 2019 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to F&#38;I rate increases, portfolio growth, and lower dealer reinsurance rates. 

Our insurance operations have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a number of jurisdictions in which we operate, governments have acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers, and many consumers and businesses have changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions. This has significantly reduced our F&#38;I written premiums in late March and April. Additionally, to the extent dealer inventory levels decline, this could result in lower vehicle inventory insurance premiums. These trends will likely continue into at least the near future and may persist until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained, authorities cease curbing household and business activity, and consumer and business confidence recover. 

Cash and Investments 

A significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.

Our Mortgage Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $ 12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to lower net financing revenue and other interest income, which was driven by higher prepayment activity, partially offset by an increase in the net gain on sale of mortgage loans and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease in net financing revenue and other interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to accelerated premium amortization of purchased loans due to higher prepayment activity driven by a lower interest rate environment. Amortization was $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, compared to $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we purchased $ 484 million of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties and originated $429 million of mortgage loans held-for-investment, compared to $1.2 billion and $262 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 

Gain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was driven by higher direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we originated $300 million of loans held-for-sale compared to $89 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 

The provision for credit losses decreased $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 , as a result of reserve releases due to decreases in asset levels, partially offset by higher expected losses due to COVID-19 driven market deterioration.

Our Corporate Finance operations incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $68 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to income earned of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease was due primarily to higher provision for credit losses recognized during the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher net financing revenue and other interest income resulting from higher asset levels. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $68 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to the growth of our loan portfolio , represented by a 31% increase in the gross carrying value of finance receivables and loans. Growth in the portfolio was primarily driven by asset-based lending , mostly through our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities. Additionally, we experienced growth in our portfolio as a result of existing borrowers who drew upon credit lines in order to obtain liquidity during the second half of March 2020 in response to developments from COVID-19. This trend of drawing upon credit lines subsided in April. 

Other revenue was $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily driven by higher syndication income, partially offset by $4 million in unrealized losses on equity securities. 

The provision for credit losses increased $91 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by $69 million of incremental reserves associated with the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, provision expense increased as a result of higher provisions for specific loan exposures , and an increase associated with portfolio growth. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Total noninterest expense was $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , respectively, compared to $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and other noninterest costs associated with growth in the business.

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Corporate and Other incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to a loss of $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase in loss before income tax expense was primarily driven by a decrease in total financing revenue and other interest income from our investment securities portfolio and hedging activities, and higher provision for credit losses for Ally Lending associated with the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from COVID-19. 

Financing revenue and other interest income was $207 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $251 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The decrease was primarily driven by the impacts of a lower interest rate environment on the investment securities portfolio and hedging activities. 

Total other revenue was $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to increased realized investment gains. 

The provision for credit losses increased $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by $18 million of incremental reserves for Ally Lending associated with the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Total assets were $39.8 billion as of March 31, 2020 , compared to $34.8 billion as of March 31, 2019 . This increase was primarily the result of growth in our available-for-sale securities portfolio and interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents. The increase was partially offset by a decline in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio and the continued runoff of our legacy mortgage portfolio. At March 31, 2020 , the gross carrying value of the legacy mortgage portfolio was $1.1 billion , compared to $1.4 billion at March 31, 2019 .

&#8226; 

Independent risk management &#8212; Operates independent of the business lines and is responsible for establishing and maintaining our risk-management framework and promulgating it enterprise-wide. Independent risk management also provides an objective, critical assessment of risks and&#8212;through oversight, effective challenge, and other means&#8212;evaluates whether Ally remains aligned with its risk appetite. 

&#8226; 

Internal audit &#8212; Provides its own independent assessments of the effectiveness of our risk management, internal controls, and governance; and independent assessments regarding the quality of our loan portfolios. Internal audit includes Audit Services and the Loan Review Group. 

Our risk-management framework is overseen by the RC. The RC sets the risk appetite across our company while risk-oriented management committees, the executive leadership team, and our associates identify and monitor current and emerging risks and manage those risks within our risk appetite.

The risks inherent in our loan and operating lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing prices, unemployment levels, and their impact on our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain the majority of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in stressed macroeconomic scenarios. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk. 

Credit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the RCs, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices, and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis. 

To mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite. 

Another important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio. 

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Additionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including principal forgiveness, maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, and changes to contractual interest rates. 

Furthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, financial futures, cash balances (for example, due from depository institutions, restricted accounts, and cash equivalents), and investment in debt securities. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

We employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. Through February 2020, the U.S. economy continued to modestly expand, led by consumer spending. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of governmental authorities implemented stay-at-home orders, and mandated closures of businesses deemed nonessential. Throughout March, the labor market began to show an impact from this unprecedented development, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% as of March 31, 2020 . As a result of the economic disruption from COVID-19, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual pace of 11.4 million in March, the lowest in nearly a decade. Rising unemployment and falling vehicle sales suggest downward pressure on used vehicle values during 2020. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, as well as high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations. We also further diversified our consumer portfolio to include personal lending through the acquisition of Health Credit Services during the fourth quarter of 2019. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at both March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 . For information on our consumer credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .

(e) 

Excludes $10 million of finance receivables at March 31, 2020 , and $11 million at December 31, 2019, for which we have elected the fair value option. 

Total consumer finance receivables and loans increased $143 million at March 31, 2020 , compared with December 31, 2019 . The increase consists of $442 million of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans, and $13 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans, partially offset by a decrease of $312 million of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans. The increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans was primarily related to continued momentum in our used vehicle lending. This increase was partially offset by lower consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans as a result of loan pay-offs which exceeded bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer origination volume. 

In response to COVID-19, we have taken a number of actions to support our borrowers and help manage credit risk. In our automotive finance business, existing customers may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges continuing to accrue. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 716,000 or approximately 18% of our existing consumer automotive customers had enrolled in this loan modification program, and approximately 71% of these enrolled customers had requested a 120-day deferral. Approximately 92% of these enrolled customers were considered current on their loans at the time of enrollment. Through April 16, 2020 , approximately 1.1 million consumer automotive loan customers have cumulatively enrolled in this program and we continue to offer this program to our customers. For new consumer automotive loans, customers are provided with the option to defer their first payment for 90 days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges accruing. 

While the cumulative enrollment in this program is unprecedented, loan extensions and modifications have historically been used successfully to help manage credit losses. We have previously been effective in administering large-scale loan extensions and modifications in targeted areas following certain natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods in recent years. We are proactively monitoring the risk profile of this population of borrowers to assist in determining our collection treatments which is a core element of our servicing program. Further, we are continuing to actively work with our delinquent customers to ensure we provide everyone with the opportunity to participate in a loan modification program where appropriate. 

In our mortgage-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to an interruption of income related to the COVID-19 pandemic may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred but with interest continuing to accrue. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 1,200 or approximately 3% of our existing mortgage-lending customers had enrolled in this program. Approximately 92% of these enrolled customers were considered current on their loans at the time of enrollment. 

In our personal-lending business, existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 120 days without late fees being incurred or finance charges continuing to accrue. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 900 or approximately 1% of our existing personal-lending customers had enrolled in this loan modification program. In addition to this program, we have temporarily suspended late fees for all customers with current accounts. 

In accordance with regulatory guidance, if borrowers are less than 30 days past due on their loans and enter into loan modifications offered as a result of COVID-19, their loans generally continue to be considered performing loans and continue to accrue interest during the period of the loan modification. For borrowers who are 30 days or more past due when entering into loan modifications offered as a result of COVID-19, we evaluate the loan modifications under our existing troubled debt restructuring framework, and where such a loan modification would result in a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan will be accounted for as a TDR and will generally not accrue interest. For all borrowers who enroll in these loan modification programs offered as a result of COVID-19, the delinquency status of 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

the borrowers is frozen, resulting in a static delinquency metric during the deferral period. Upon exiting the deferral program, the measurement of loan delinquency will resume where it had left off upon entry into the program. 

Total consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at March 31, 2020 , increased $319 million to $1.1 billion from December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to our consumer automotive loan portfolio which experienced higher delinquency rates as part of our continued diversification strategy and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as portfolio growth. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 1.3% at March 31, 2020 , and 0.9% at December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Total consumer TDRs outstanding at March 31, 2020 , increased $223 million since December 31, 2019, to $969 million. Results primarily reflect a $224 million increase in our consumer automotive loan portfolio, driven by the impact of our loan modification program offered to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, where the loan modification in connection with other factors resulted in a TDR classification. Refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Consumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more decreased $294 million to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2020 , compared to December 31, 2019 , primarily due to seasonality. This decrease was partially offset by higher delinquency rates experienced in our portfolio as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(a) 

Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held-for-sale during the period for each loan category. 

Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $264 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $232 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio increased by $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a brief scheduled moratorium on all collections and repossession activities at the end of 2019 prior to the conversion to a new servicing and accounting technology platform. Charge-offs also increased as a result of lower recoveries, and loan portfolio growth. Through much of the first quarter, our consumer automotive loan portfolio experienced strong overall credit performance driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions including low unemployment and continued disciplined underwriting. During the second half of March and into April economic conditions have deteriorated as a result of COVID-19. While we have taken a number of actions including the utilization of loan modification programs to support our customers and manage credit risk, we may incur higher charge-offs in future periods as a result of continued economic dislocation resulting from the impacts of COVID-19.

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Total consumer loan originations increased $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to growth in the direct-to-consumer mortgage business driven by the lower interest rate environment, as well as origination volume from Ally Lending. These increases were mostly offset by lower consumer automotive loan originations driven by lower GM used volume and Growth new volume, partially offset by higher Growth used volume. 

The following table shows the percentage of consumer automotive and consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans by state concentration based on amortized cost.

Presentation is in descending order as a percentage of total consumer finance receivables and loans at March 31, 2020 . 

We monitor our consumer loan portfolio for concentration risk across the states in which we lend. The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in California and Texas, which represented an aggregate of 24.9% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at both March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 . Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily composed of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally. 

Repossessed and Foreclosed Assets 

We classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed, which is included in other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet , when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Repossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations increased $39 million from December 31, 2019 , to $186 million at March 31, 2020 . Foreclosed mortgage assets decreased $3 million from December 31, 2019 , to $6 million at March 31, 2020 . 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained stable as both nonperforming finance receivables and loans and our net charge-offs remained low. For information on our commercial credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .

(b) 

Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. 

(c) 

Other commercial and industrial primarily includes senior secured commercial lending largely associated with our Corporate Finance operations. 

Total commercial finance receivables and loans outstanding decreased $234 million from December 31, 2019 , to $38.1 billion at March 31, 2020 . The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of GM dealer relationships due to the competitive environment across the automotive lending market . This decrease was partially offset by growth in our Corporate Finance portfolio that was primarily driven by asset-based lending, mostly through our lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities. Additionally, we experienced growth in our portfolio as a result of existing borrowers who drew upon credit lines in order to obtain liquidity during the second half of March 2020 in response to developments from COVID-19. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we announced a series of actions to support our customers and manage credit risk within our commercial automotive loan portfolio. In addition, for dealers with current accounts, we have offered for up to four months a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans, an increase in floorplan advance rates, a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings, and a deferral of term loan payments . As of March 31, 2020, approximately 2,270 or approximately 72% of eligible dealers had requested at least one form of this assistance. These accounts will remain current and continue to accrue interest in accordance with recently issued guidance from regulators. Additionally, if the borrower was no more than 30 days past due as of the date of the modification program was implemented, the modification was not considered a TDR. 

Total commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were $256 million at March 31, 2020 , reflecting an increase of $41 million when compared to December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of one exposure within our Corporate Finance portfolio, as well as exposure to one automotive dealer group that was placed into default during the quarter. Nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans increased to 0.7% at March 31, 2020 , compared to 0.6% at December 31, 2019 . 

Total commercial TDRs outstanding at March 31, 2020 , increased $11 million since December 31, 2019 , to $133 million, reflecting an increase of $16 million in our Corporate Finance portfolio and a decrease of $5 million in our commercial automotive portfolio. The increase in our Corporate Finance portfolio was primarily driven by the additional restructuring of one exposure. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Commercial Criticized Exposure 

Finance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are reported as criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss. 

Total criticized exposures increased $933 million from December 31, 2019 , to $5.2 billion at March 31, 2020 . The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of one dealership group, as well as one exposure within our Corporate Finance portfolio that has been significantly impacted by the mandated closures of businesses deemed nonessential.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

Implementation of CECL 

We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Upon implementation of CECL, we recognized a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance of approximately $1.0 billion, net of income tax, which reflects a pre-tax increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $1.3 billion. This increase is almost exclusively driven by our consumer automotive loan portfolio. 

We have elected to phase the estimated impact of CECL into regulatory capital in accordance with the interim final rule of the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies that became effective on March 31, 2020. As a result, we will delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

The CECL standard introduces a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized costs. In contrast to the previous incurred loss model, CECL requires credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost to be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of assets. 

Under CECL, our modeling processes incorporate the following considerations: 

&#8226; 

a single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process; 

&#8226; 

a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period; and 

&#8226; 

data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period. 

Our quantitatively determined allowance under CECL is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors as further described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . For example, macroeconomic variables that our consumer automotive allowance for loan losses is most sensitive to include national and state unemployment levels. Our process for determining the allowance for loan losses considers a borrower&#8217;s willingness and ability to pay and considers other factors, including loan modification programs. In addition to our quantitative allowance for credit losses, we also incorporate qualitative adjustments that may relate to idiosyncratic risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results such as the impacts associated with COVID-19. 

COVID-19 Impacts 

During the second half of March 2020, the broader economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables that are utilized in our modeling processes. Given the fact that the macroeconomic information utilized in our quantitative allowance processes did not fully reflect the rapidly evolving economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we utilized our qualitative allowance framework to ensure the total reserve under CECL reflected the most current forecast of the broader macroeconomic environment. 

To help inform our forecast, we considered publicly published, broadly available stressed macroeconomic data including the Moody&#8217;s forecast from March 27, 2020, that reflected the most recent available information that considered the evolving impacts of developments from the COVID-19 pandemic as of March 31, 2020, in order to support the qualitative adjustments incorporated into our total allowance. Stressed macroeconomic variables that we utilized as of March 31, 2020, include the following, among others: unemployment rate approaching 10%, significant GDP contraction quarter-over-quarter, and declining new light vehicle sales. 

Our qualitatively determined allowance associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook from COVID-19 was incremental to our modeled reserves, resulting in $602 million of additional provision expense for loan losses. The following table presents a summary of the provision expense by portfolio segment related to COVID-19 qualitatively determined reserves for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Represents the amount of the amortized cost directly written off. For consumer and commercial loans, the loss from a charge-off is measured as the difference between the amortized cost of a loan and the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our charge-off policies. 

(b) 

Consumer mortgage provision expense includes $2 million related to Mortgage Finance and a provision benefit of $5 million related to our legacy mortgage portfolio. Commercial provision expense includes $6 million related to commercial automotive and $23 million related to commercial other within the commercial and industrial portfolio class, and $1 million in provision benefit related to commercial real estate. 

(c) 

Coverage percentages are based on the allowance for loan losses related to finance receivables and loans excluding those loans held at fair value as a percentage of the amortized cost. 

The allowance for consumer loan losses at March 31, 2020 , increased $1.8 billion compared to March 31, 2019 , reflecting increases of $1.8 billion in the consumer automotive allowance and an increase of $45 million in the consumer other allowance, partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in the consumer mortgage allowance. The increase in our consumer allowance was primarily driven by our adoption of CECL which resulted in a $1.3 billion increase to the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, our consumer allowance for loan losses increased as a result of the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a consumer automotive reserve increase of $436 million and consumer other reserve increase of $18 million. The decrease in the consumer mortgage allowance was primarily driven by the decrease in finance receivables of $648 million at March 31, 2020 , compared to March 31, 2019 . 

The allowance for commercial loan losses increased $162 million at March 31, 2020 , compared to March 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by our commercial automotive and Corporate Finance portfolios due to reserve increases of $73 million and $69 million, respectively, associated with higher expected losses due to COVID-19 driven market deterioration. 

The provision for consumer loan losses was $707 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $254 million for three months ended March 31, 2019 . For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the increase in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by consumer automotive reserve increases of $436 million associated with higher expected losses due to the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The provision for commercial loan losses increased $168 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The increase in provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily driven by our commercial automotive and Corporate Finance portfolios which experienced a net reserve increase of $142 million as a result of the expected broad macroeconomic impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our Corporate Finance portfolio experienced higher reserves associated with $1.5 billion in higher finance receivables and an increase in specific reserves associated with two loan exposures.

Market Risk 

Our financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held-for-sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and off-lease vehicle prices. 

The impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 

The fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 

We are also exposed to foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk. 

We also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values. Refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may experience changes in the valuation of these investments, which may cause volatility in our earnings. 

The composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. Refer to Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

LIBOR Transition 

Ally recognizes the significance of LIBOR cessation, and has devoted numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to actively identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with this transition. Our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our Board through the RC and certain executive committees including the ALCO and the ERMC. For a more detailed discussion of our planned transition away from LIBOR, refer to the section titled Risk Management&#8212;LIBOR Transition in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform: Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, as further described in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . The final guidance issued by the 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

FASB is intended to help facilitate the market transition from existing reference interest rates to alternative reference interest rates. This guidance provides temporary, optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments primarily include relief related to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and it also provides a one-time election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. This guidance is effective immediately and the amendments may be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. We are currently in the process of evaluating the amendments and we anticipate the final guidance will allow for greater flexibility in the transition away from LIBOR. 

Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments. 

We prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions. 

Simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates. 

The net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. We test a number of alternative rate scenarios, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, which is based on the implied forward curve, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months would increase by $25 million if interest rates remain unchanged. 

The following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming 100 basis point and 200 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock increases, and assuming 100 basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual parallel shock decreases to the implied market forward curve as of March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 .

(a) 

Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months. 

(b) 

The impact of the downward rate shocks is impacted by the current low interest rate environment, which limits absolute declines in rates. 

The implied forward rate curve was significantly lower across all tenors compared to December 31, 2019, as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of March 31, 2020, our net interest income sensitivity in the +100 and +200 basis point instantaneous shock scenarios is positioned to benefit primarily due to changes to our derivative hedging position and the impact of lower market interest rates. 

The exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has increased as of March 31, 2020, primarily due to the derivative hedging position referenced above as well as the impact of lower rates. Due to the low absolute level of market interest rates, this downward shock is muted as our models assume rates do not go below zero . 

Our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. We also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floating-rate assets. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time. 

Operating Lease Residual Risk Management 

We are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception. However, certain automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . Our operating lease portfolio, net of

accumulated depreciation was $9.1 billion and $8.9 billion as of March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $7.5 billion and $7.2 billion as of March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 , respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within the MD&#38;A in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We recognized an average gain per vehicle of $121 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $573 for the same period in 2019 . The decrease in average gain per vehicle for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019 , was primarily due to a decline in used vehicle values resulting from increased market supply. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the three months ended March 31, 2020 , decreased 22% compared to the same period in 2019 . The decrease in remarketing volume for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was primarily due to a temporary reduction in vehicle remarketing activity as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases and, subsequently, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which furthered the reduction in vehicle remarketing activity during the second half of March 2020, driven by reduced activity at auction sites and low dealer demand . Additionally, in jurisdictions where governments have acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers, there have also been fewer vehicles returned at lease termination. These trends of reduced remarketing activity have continued into April, and the persistence of this trend will largely be driven by when the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained, authorities cease curbing household and business activity, and consumer and business confidence recover. The delay in vehicle remarketing may adversely impact our remarketing proceeds upon sale in future periods. In order to mitigate these risks, management has taken proactive measures including working with customers to extend leases. 

In connection with our actions to support our customers and help mitigate lease residual risk, we are allowing for the deferral of lease payments without fees for up to 120 days for any consumer requesting assistance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 33,000 or 10% of our lease customers enrolled in this lease modification program, and approximately 66% of enrolled borrowers requested a 120 deferral. We also began offering customers nearing their scheduled lease-end date the ability to extend their lease for up to an additional 180 days. Through this lease extension, the lessee is not charged for the first month of the extension, and the following months of the extended lease are offered under the terms of the existing lease contract. While there was not a significant amount of leases extended as of March 31, 2020, we continue to work with our lease customers that may be interested in extending their lease when approaching lease maturity.

Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital 

Overview 

The purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, committed secured credit facilities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions. 

The ALCO, chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management. 

Funding Strategy 

Liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed secured credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, FHLB advances, whole-loan sales, demand notes, and repurchase agreements. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles. 

We manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB. 

Essentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include coverage ratios and comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed secured credit facility capacity. This available liquidity is held at various legal entities, taking into consideration regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities. The following table summarizes our total available liquidity.

Recent Funding Developments 

During March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This global health crisis has resulted in economic disruption and volatility in the capital markets. While we have continued to access our routine short-term funding sources, such as FHLB borrowings and repurchase agreements, credit spreads for longer-term funding sources such as unsecured debt and ABS issuance have increased. In response to some of the recent market dislocation, the FRB has taken a number of actions to increase market liquidity. These actions included providing significant quantitative-easing programs, expanding the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, broadening the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, launching new funds and facilities to support employers, consumers and businesses, and establishing the Term Asset Backed Loan Facility to facilitate ABS issuance of student, automotive, credit card, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. We continue to closely monitor market conditions, and actions taken by banking agencies to support general market liquidity. In recent years, we have become less reliant on market-based funding and believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our near-term funding needs. However, it is not currently clear to what degree the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future funding profile if market dislocation increases or persists for an extended amount of time. 

During 2020, we accessed the public and private markets to execute secured funding transactions, and to manage our committed secured credit facility capacity. Key funding highlights from January 1, 2020 , to date were as follows: 

&#8226; 

In April 2020, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes, which provided additional parent company liquidity, and further mitigated the risk of potential market volatility in future periods. 

&#8226; 

Our total capacity in committed secured credit facilities was reduced by $950 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 , as we continue to shift our overall funding toward a greater mix of cost-effective deposit funding.

Deposits 

Ally Bank is a direct bank with no branch network that obtains retail deposits directly from customers through internet, telephone, mobile, and mail channels. These retail deposits provide our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance operations as well as Ally Lending with a stable and low-cost funding source. Retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reduced reliance on capital markets-based funding. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. We have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels. Current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including CDs, savings accounts, money-market accounts, IRA deposit products, as well as an interest checking product. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries, including a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances. 

The following table shows Ally Bank&#8217;s number of accounts and deposit balances as of the end of each quarter since 2019 .

Brokered deposit balances include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2020 , $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, and $1.1 billion as September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, and March 31, 2019. 

(b) 

Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits. 

During the first three months of 2020 , our total deposit base grew $1.6 billion , driven by continued growth in retail deposits, which was partially offset by a reduction in brokered deposits. Total retail deposits increased $2.3 billion , primarily within our online savings product and retail CDs, as we added approximately 71,000 retail deposit customers during the three months ended March 31, 2020 , to more than 2.0 million total retail deposit customers at March 31, 2020 . Strong retention rates and customer acquisition, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to drive growth in retail deposits. We continue to enhance our suite of online and mobile banking features, as we introduced a collection of smart savings tools to our online savings product in February 2020. For additional information on our deposit funding by type, refer to Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Securitizations and Secured Financings 

While we primarily fund our business through deposits, we also utilize securitizations and secured funding to further diversify our funding sources. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions, allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business. We continue to remain active in the well-established securitization markets. Additionally, for consumer automotive loans and operating leases, the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases, which creates an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk. For additional details surrounding our securitization activities, refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the first three months of 2020 , we raised $48 million through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans. 

We manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks. Our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. We maintain bilateral facilities, which fund our Automotive Finance operations. The facilities can be revolving in nature&#8212;generally having an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment period&#8212;or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period. At March 31, 2020 , all of our $1.6 billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance, $550 million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days. 

Our securitizations of commercial automotive loans are issued through a single master trust and include credit-enhancement triggers as well as early-repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loans in the applicable securitizations are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than to purchase newly originated loans. One of the early amortization events is based on the rates of inventory turnover at our dealer customers, referred to as payment rates. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is placing downward pressure on the automotive sales of dealers and therefore their rate of inventory turnover, an increased risk exists that an early amortization event could occur. In such a case, our ability to issue new securitizations out of this trust would be constrained or eliminated and our ability to fund commercial automotive loans through the securitization market could be delayed while we establish a new trust. In addition, the mere occurrence of an early amortization event could impair our ability to access the securitization market or increase our cost to do so. At this time, none of these securitizations have experienced an early amortization event. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

The majority of our securitizations, including our secured bilateral financing facilities, involve consumer automotive loans. We retain exposure to the non-performance of these loans through subordinated retained interests in the securitizations as well as obligations to repurchase loans affected by breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants. The secured bilateral financing facilities also include credit-enhancement triggers and revolving period termination events based on the non-performance of loans. With the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affecting some of our consumer automotive customers and with a significant number of them having enrolled in our loan-deferral program, these securitizations may become more likely to experience a deterioration in loan performance and downgrades by rating agencies. In addition, the secured bilateral financing facilities may become more likely to experience the activation of credit-enhancement triggers and revolving period termination events. Any of these outcomes could have negative impacts on noteholders and us, including in our case a potential for higher pricing and less market access for future securitizations. 

We also have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of March 31, 2020 , we had pledged $25.2 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $19.7 billion in total funding capacity with $18.8 billion of debt outstanding. 

At March 31, 2020 , $48.1 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings and repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Unsecured Financings 

We obtain unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our Demand Notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. Demand Notes outstanding were $2.4 billion at March 31, 2020 . We also have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed-maturity dates and floating-rate notes. There were $256 million of retail term notes outstanding at March 31, 2020 . The remainder of our unsecured debt is composed of institutional term debt. In April 2020, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised $750 million through the issuance of senior notes. Refer to Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt. 

Other Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings 

We have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of March 31, 2020 , we had $482 million debt outstanding under repurchase agreements. 

Additionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of March 31, 2020 . We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of March 31, 2020 . 

Guaranteed Securities 

Certain senior notes (collectively, the Guaranteed Notes) issued by Ally Financial Inc. (referred to within this section as the Parent) are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by IB Finance, a subsidiary of the Parent and the direct parent of Ally Bank, and Ally US LLC, a subsidiary of the Parent (together, the Guarantors, and the guarantee provided by each such Guarantor, the Note Guarantees). The Guarantors are primary obligors with respect to payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Parent in respect of the Guaranteed Notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture. At March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019 , the outstanding principal balance of the Guaranteed Notes was $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion , respectively, with the last scheduled maturity to take place in 2031. 

The Note Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable Guarantor&#8217;s existing and future unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness and are subordinate to any secured indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Note Guarantees are structurally subordinate to indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables and lease obligations, and in the case of Ally Bank, its deposits) of any nonguarantor subsidiaries of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets of such subsidiaries. 

The Note Guarantees and all other obligations of the Guarantors will terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) upon a permissible sale, disposition, or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of a majority of the equity interests (including any sale, disposition or other transfer following which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the Parent), of the applicable Guarantor, or (ii) upon the discharge of the Parent&#8217;s obligations related to the Guaranteed Notes.

Cash Flows 

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows . While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $814 million and $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , and 2019, respectively. Activity was largely consistent year-over-year, as cash flows from our consumer and commercial lending activities remained relatively flat. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $325 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , compared to $2.0 billion for the same period in 2019 . The decrease was primarily due to a $2.9 billion increase in proceeds from sales and repayments of available-for-sale securities, net of purchases. This was partially offset by an increase of $843 million in net outflows from purchases and sales of equity securities, and an increase of $402 million in outflows from purchases of operating lease assets, net of disposals. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , was $2.2 billion , compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $237 million for the same period in 2019 . The change was primarily attributable to an increase in net cash inflows related to short-term borrowings of $7.8 billion between the two periods. This was partially offset by a decrease of $ 5.5 billion in net cash inflows associated with deposits. 

Capital Planning and Stress Tests 

As a Category IV firm, we are subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and are exempted from company-run capital stress testing. We are also required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. Our annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with our risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB&#8217;s final rule introducing the stress capital buffer requirement, which is described in Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements , makes several changes to the CCAR process that will apply beginning with the 2020 cycle. The final rule also contains a transition provision that, subject to the FRB&#8217;s assessment of our planned acquisition of CardWorks and other specified conditions, may allow us to make capital distributions during the third quarter of 2020 without prior approval if the distributions do not exceed the average of capital distributions over the four quarters of our 2019 capital plan. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

We received a non-objection to our 2018 capital plan in June 2018. We were not required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run capital stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, our capital actions during this cycle are largely based on the results from our 2018 supervisory stress test. On April 1, 2019, our Board authorized an increase in our stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock from time to time from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. On March 17, 2020, in order to support the FRB's effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy and the financial system, we announced the voluntary suspension of our stock-repurchase program for the remaining period of the first quarter and for the second quarter of 2020. Prior to the voluntary suspension of our stock-repurchase program, we repurchased $104 million of common stock during the first quarter of 2020. We retain the discretion, however, to resume purchases of common stock under our stock-repurchase program. On April 16, 2020 , our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share of our common stock. Refer to Note 24 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the most recent dividend. 

Ally submitted its 2020 capital plan on April 3, 2020, which includes expected capital distributions to common stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB&#8217;s review and internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including CECL), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. 

Regulatory Capital 

Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the section titled Selected Financial Data within this MD&#38;A. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors). 

Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations rate substantially all our debt. The following table summarizes our current ratings and outlook by the respective nationally recognized rating agencies.

(b) 

Moody&#8217;s upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Ba1 from Ba2, affirmed our short-term rating of Not Prime, and maintained a Stable outlook on December 19, 2019. Effective December 1, 2014, we determined to not renew our contractual arrangement with Moody&#8217;s related to their providing of our issuer, senior unsecured debt, and short-term ratings. Notwithstanding this, Moody&#8217;s has determined to continue to provide these ratings on a discretionary basis. However, Moody&#8217;s has no obligation to continue to provide these ratings, and could cease doing so at any time. 

(c) 

Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- from BB+, upgraded our short-term rating to A-3 from B, and changed the outlook to Stable from Positive on October 16, 2019. 

(d) 

DBRS affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BBB (Low), affirmed our short-term rating of R-3, and changed the outlook to Negative from Positive on April 21, 2020. 

During 2019, both S&#38;P and Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BB+ to BBB-, which is defined by both rating agencies as an investment grade credit rating. Following our announcement to acquire CardWorks on February 18, 2020, Fitch, Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P, and DBRS affirmed our credit ratings for our short-term and senior unsecured debt, with each agency maintaining its respective outlook. On April 21, 2020, DBRS changed their long-term outlook to Negative from Positive. Given the current operating environment and adverse impacts related to COVID-19, we expect other rating agencies may also potentially reassess their outlooks or ratings. 

Rating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices&#8212;particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We identified critical accounting estimates that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions. 

Our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Allowance for loan losses 

&#8226; 

Valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals 

&#8226; 

Fair value of financial instruments 

&#8226; 

Determination of provision for income taxes 

On January 1, 2020 we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses . This guidance replaced the incurred loss methodology, which was used to calculate the allowance for loan losses as described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, with an expected lifetime loss methodology, as described in the Allowance for Loan Losses section below. 

During 2020, we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the remaining critical accounting estimates from what was described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

We maintain an allowance for loan losses (the allowance) to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios. The allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information, which includes both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance, net of amounts recovered on previously charged-off accounts. Expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts charged-off or expected to be charged-off. The allowance is measured using statistical models that are designed to correlate certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses. The macroeconomic data used in the models are based on forecasted variables for the next 12 months. Beyond this forecast period, we revert to an historical average for each of the variables on a straight-line basis over 24 months. The allowance reflects management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment, which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. For additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes, refer to Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The consumer portfolio segments consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans within our Automotive Finance operations, Mortgage Finance operations, and consumer unsecured lending operations which is included within Corporate and Other. The allowance model for each consumer portfolio segment is calculated using proprietary statistical models and other risk indicators applied to pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually. For additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments, refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of larger-balance, nonhomogeneous exposures within our Automotive Finance operations and Corporate Finance operations. These loans generally do not have similar risk characteristics and, as a result, are primarily evaluated individually. Management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans&#8217; effective interest rate, or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral, whichever is determined to be the most appropriate. Estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the impairment measurement, when appropriate. Loans that share similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively. For additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment, refer to Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss, including changes in LGD, PD, and rating migration. The critical assumptions underlying the allowance include: (i) segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics; (ii) the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions; and (iii) evaluation by management of borrower, collateral, and geographic information. Management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date, based on the best information available at that time.
