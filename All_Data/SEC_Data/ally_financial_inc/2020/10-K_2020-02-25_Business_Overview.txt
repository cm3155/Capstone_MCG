 Item 1. Business 

Our Business 

Ally Financial Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, Ally, the Company, or we, us, or our) is a leading digital financial-services company with $180.6 billion in assets as of December 31, 2019 . As a customer-centric company with passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions, we are relentlessly focused on &#8220;Doing It Right&#8221; and being a trusted financial-services provider to our consumer, commercial, and corporate customers. We are one of the largest full-service automotive-finance operations in the country and offer a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and consumers. Our award-winning online bank (Ally Bank, Member FDIC and Equal Housing Lender) offers mortgage-lending, personal lending, and a variety of deposit and other banking products, including savings, money-market, and checking accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Additionally, we offer securities-brokerage and investment-advisory services through Ally Invest. Our robust corporate-finance business offers capital for equity sponsors and middle-market companies. 

We are a Delaware corporation and are registered as a bank holding company (BHC) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act), and a financial holding company (FHC) under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended (GLB Act). Our primary business lines are Dealer Financial Services, which is composed of our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance. Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, the activity related to Ally Invest and Ally Lending (formerly known as Health Credit Services), and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. Ally Bank&#8217;s assets and operating results are included within our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, and Corporate Finance segments, as well as Corporate and Other, based on its underlying business activities. As of December 31, 2019 , Ally Bank had total assets of $167.5 billion and total deposits of $120.8 billion . 

Our strategic focus is centered around (1) differentiating our company as a relentless ally for the financial well-being of our customers, (2) ongoing optimization of our market lending automotive and insurance business lines, (3) sustained growth in customers and optimization of our deposit funding profile, (4) expanding consumer product offerings, (5) efficient capital deployment and disciplined risk management, and (6) ensuring that our culture remains aligned with a relentless focus on our customers, communities, associates, and stockholders. We seek to extend our leading position in automotive finance in the United States by continuing to provide automotive dealers and their retail customers with premium service, a comprehensive product suite, consistent funding, and competitive pricing&#8212;reflecting our commitment to the automotive industry. Within our Automotive Finance and Insurance operations, we are also focused on strengthening our network of dealer relationships and pursuing digital distribution channels for our products and services, including through our operation of a direct-lending platform (Clearlane), our participation in other direct-lending platforms, and our work with dealers innovating in digital transactions&#8212;all while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. Within our other banking operations&#8212;including Mortgage Finance and Corporate Finance&#8212;we seek to expand our consumer and commercial banking products and services while providing a high level of customer service. In 2019, Ally acquired Credit Services Corporation, LLC and its subsidiary, Health Credit Services LLC, which has been renamed Ally Lending and which is strategically exploring ways to expand beyond its historical emphasis on unsecured personal lending for medical procedures and serve as our point-of-sale personal-lending platform more generally. In addition, we continue to focus on delivering significant and sustainable growth in deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. At Ally Invest, we seek to augment our securities-brokerage and investment-advisory services to more comprehensively assist our customers in managing their savings and wealth. 

Upon launching our first ever enterprise-wide campaign themed &#8220;Do It Right,&#8221; we introduced a broad audience to our full suite of digital financial services, which emphasizes our relentless customer-centric focus and commitment to constantly create and reinvent our product offerings and digital experiences to meet the needs of consumers. We continue to build on this foundation and invest in enhancing the customer experience with integrated features across product lines on our digital platform. Our expanded product offerings and unique brand are increasingly gaining traction in the marketplace, as demonstrated by industry recognition of our award-winning direct online bank and strong retention rates of our growing customer base. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply. The term &#8220;loans&#8221; means the following consumer and commercial products associated with our direct and indirect financing activities: loans, retail installment sales contracts, lines of credit, and other financing products excluding operating leases. The term &#8220;operating leases&#8221; means consumer- and commercial-vehicle lease agreements where Ally is the lessor and where the lessee is generally not obligated to acquire ownership of the vehicle at lease-end or compensate Ally for the vehicle&#8217;s residual value. The terms &#8220;lend,&#8221; &#8220;finance,&#8221; and &#8220;originate&#8221; mean our direct extension or origination of loans, our purchase or acquisition of loans, or our purchase of operating leases as applicable. The term &#8220;consumer&#8221; means all consumer products associated with our loan and operating-lease activities and all commercial retail installment sales contracts. The term &#8220;commercial&#8221; means all commercial products associated with our loan activities, other than commercial retail installment sales contracts. 

For further details and information related to our business segments and the products and services they provide, refer to Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&#38;A) in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Industry and Competition 

The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and point-of-sale personal lending), securities brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance companies, and independent finance companies. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors in automotive financing and insurance, such as captive automotive finance companies, have certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturers whose customers and dealers make up a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, our banking, securities brokerage, and investment-advisory businesses face intense competition from banks, savings associations, finance companies, credit unions, mutual funds, investment advisers, asset managers, brokerage firms, hedge funds, insurance companies, mortgage-banking companies, and credit card companies. Financial-technology (fintech) companies compete with us directly, and also have been partnering more often with financial services providers to compete against us in lending and other markets. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, investment capacity, and brand recognition as well as lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and less reliance on securitization, unsecured debt, and other capital markets. Our competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent legislative, regulatory, and supervisory regimes than we are. A range of competitors differ from us in their strategic and tactical priorities and, for example, may be willing to suffer meaningful financial losses in the pursuit of disruptive innovation or to accept more aggressive business, compliance, and other risks in the pursuit of higher returns. Competition affects every aspect of our business, including product and service offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. Successfully competing in our markets also depends on our ability to innovate, to invest in technology and infrastructure, to maintain and enhance our reputation, and to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, all the while effectively managing risks and expenses. We expect that competition will only intensify in the future. 

Regulation and Supervision 

We are subject to significant regulatory frameworks in the United States&#8212;at federal, state, and local levels&#8212;that affect the products and services that we may offer and the manner in which we may offer them, the risks that we may take, the ways in which we may operate, and the corporate and financial actions that we may take. 

We are also subject to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry self-regulatory organizations (SROs) that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and a number of state regulatory and licensing authorities such as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). These agencies and organizations generally have broad authority and discretion in restricting and otherwise affecting our businesses and operations and may take formal or informal supervisory, enforcement, and other actions against us when, in the applicable agency&#8217;s or organization&#8217;s judgment, our businesses or operations fail to comply with applicable law, comport with safe and sound practices, or meet its supervisory expectations. 

This system of regulation, supervision, and examination is intended primarily for the protection and benefit of our depositors and other customers, the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the banking and financial systems as a whole, and the broader economy&#8212;and not for the protection or benefit of our stockholders (except in the case of securities laws) or non-deposit creditors. The scope, intensity, and focus of this system can vary from time to time for reasons that range from the state of the economic and political environments to the performance of our businesses and operations, but for the foreseeable future, we expect to remain subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examinations. 

This section summarizes some relevant provisions of the principal statutes, regulations, and other laws that apply to us. The descriptions, however, are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text and judicial or administrative interpretations of those laws and other laws that affect us. 

Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status 

Ally and IB Finance Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (IB Finance), are BHCs under the BHC Act. Ally is also an FHC under the GLB Act. IB Finance is a direct subsidiary of Ally and the direct parent of Ally Bank, which is a commercial bank that is organized under the laws of the State of Utah and whose deposits are insured by the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). As BHCs, Ally and IB Finance are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Ally Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB and the UDFI. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Permitted Activities &#8212; Under the BHC Act, BHCs and their subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and to closely related activities that are incident to banking. The GLB Act amended the BHC Act and created a regulatory framework for FHCs, which are BHCs that meet certain qualifications and elect FHC status. FHCs, directly or indirectly through their nonbank subsidiaries, are generally permitted to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than those that are permissible for BHCs&#8212;for example, (1) underwriting, dealing in, and making a market in securities; (2) providing financial, investment, and economic advisory services; (3) underwriting insurance; and (4) merchant banking activities. The FRB regulates, supervises, and examines FHCs, as it does all BHCs, but insurance and securities activities conducted by an FHC or any of its nonbank subsidiaries are also regulated, supervised, and examined by functional regulators such as state insurance commissioners, the SEC, or FINRA. Ally&#8217;s status as an FHC allows us to provide insurance products and services, to deliver our SmartAuction finder services and a number of related vehicle-remarketing services for third parties, and to offer a range of brokerage and advisory services. To remain eligible to conduct these broader financial and related activities, Ally and Ally Bank must remain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well- 

##TABLE_END

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

managed,&#8221; in each case as defined under applicable law. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section below titled Basel Capital Frameworks for additional information. In addition, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or to make acquisitions generally requires that we achieve a rating of satisfactory or better under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). 

Further, under the BHC Act, we may be subject to approvals, conditions, and other restrictions when seeking to acquire control over another entity or its assets. For this purpose, &#8220;control&#8221; includes (a) directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding the power to vote 25% or more of any class of the entity&#8217;s voting securities, (b) controlling in any manner the election of a majority of the entity&#8217;s directors, trustees, or individuals performing similar functions, or (c) directly or indirectly exercising a controlling influence over the management or policies of the entity. Under rules of the FRB, whether Ally is presumed to have a &#8220;controlling influence&#8221; over an entity is determined by applying a framework of tiered presumptions of control that are based on the percentage of a class of voting securities held by Ally and nine other relationships with the entity. For example, Ally would be presumed to have such a controlling influence with less than 5% of a class of voting securities and any of the following: a management agreement with the entity, one-half or more of the directors on the entity&#8217;s board, or one-third or more of the total equity in the entity. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Enhanced Prudential Standards &#8212; Ally is currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). In May 2018, targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-services laws were enacted through the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCP Act), including amendments that affect whether and, if so, how the FRB applies enhanced prudential standards to BHCs like us with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. In October 2019, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued final rules implementing these amendments. The final rules establish four risk-based categories of prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The most stringent standards and requirements apply to U.S. global systemically important BHCs, which are assigned to Category I. The assignment of other banking organizations to the remaining three categories is based on measures of size and four other risk-based indicators: cross-jurisdictional activity, weighted short-term wholesale funding (wSTWF), nonbank assets, and off-balance-sheet exposure. Under the final rules, Ally is designated as a Category IV firm and, as such, is (1) made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle rather than the previously required one-year cycle, (2) required to continue submitting an annual capital plan to the FRB, (3) allowed to continue excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from regulatory capital, (4) required to continue maintaining a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, (5) required to conduct liquidity stress tests on a quarterly basis rather than the previously required monthly basis, (6) allowed to engage in more tailored liquidity risk management, including monthly rather than weekly calculations of collateral positions, the elimination of limits for activities that are not relevant to the firm, and fewer required elements of monitoring of intraday liquidity exposures, (7) exempted from company-run capital stress testing, (8) exempted from the modified liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the proposed modified net stable funding ratio provided that wSTWF remains under $50 billion , and (9) allowed to remain exempted from the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and single-counterparty credit limits. The final rules went in effect on December 31, 2019 . 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements &#8212; Ally and Ally Bank are subject to various capital adequacy requirements. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section below titled Basel Capital Frameworks for additional information. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Capital Planning and Stress Tests &#8212; Under the final rules described earlier in Enhanced Prudential Standards, Ally is (1) made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle rather than the previously required one-year cycle, (2) required to continue submitting an annual capital plan to the FRB, (3) allowed to continue excluding AOCI from regulatory capital, (4) exempted from company-run capital stress testing, and (5) allowed to remain exempted from the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer. Ally&#8217;s annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a discussion of how Ally, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. If the FRB objects to the plan, or if certain material events occur after submission of the plan, Ally must submit a revised plan to the FRB within 30 days. 

##TABLE_END We received a non-objection to our 2018 capital plan in June 2018. We were not required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), or conduct company-run capital stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, our capital actions during this cycle were largely based on the results from our 2018 supervisory stress test. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Resolution Planning &#8212; Under rules of the FDIC, Ally Bank is required to periodically submit to the FDIC a resolution plan (commonly known as a living will) that would enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve Ally Bank in the event of its insolvency under the FDI Act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of Ally Bank&#8217;s failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. If the FDIC 

##TABLE_END

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

determines that the resolution plan is not credible and the deficiencies are not adequately remedied in a timely manner, the FDIC may take formal or informal supervisory, enforcement, and other actions against us. Ally Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan on July 1, 2018. In April 2019, the FDIC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on ways to tailor and improve its resolution-planning rules and, at the same time, delayed the next round of resolution-plan submissions until the rulemaking process has been completed. Under the final rules described earlier in Enhanced Prudential Standards , Ally is no longer required to submit to the FRB and the FDIC a plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of Ally and its significant legal entities under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Limitations on Bank and BHC Dividends and Other Capital Distributions &#8212; Federal and Utah law place a number of conditions, limits, and other restrictions on dividends and other capital distributions that may be paid by Ally Bank to IB Finance and thus indirectly to Ally. In addition, even if the FRB does not object to our capital plan, Ally and IB Finance may be precluded from or limited in paying dividends or other capital distributions without the FRB&#8217;s approval under certain circumstances&#8212;for example, if Ally or IB Finance were to not meet minimum regulatory capital ratios after giving effect to the distributions. FRB supervisory guidance also directs BHCs like us to consult with the FRB prior to increasing dividends, implementing common-stock-repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. Further, the U.S. banking agencies are authorized to prohibit an insured depository institution, like Ally Bank, or a BHC, like Ally, from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices and, depending upon the circumstances, could find that paying a dividend or other capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. On April 1, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.25 billion of our common stock from time to time from the third quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2020. For additional information on our capital actions, including our stock-repurchase program and dividends on our common stock, refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB&#8217;s review and approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, regulatory considerations, any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity (including Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ), financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Transactions with Affiliates &#8212; Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB&#8217;s Regulation W prevent Ally and its nonbank subsidiaries from taking undue advantage of the benefits afforded to Ally Bank as a depository institution, including its access to federal deposit insurance and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. Pursuant to these laws, &#8220;covered transactions&#8221;&#8212;including Ally Bank&#8217;s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its affiliates&#8212;are generally subject to meaningful restrictions. For example, unless otherwise exempted, (1) covered transactions are limited to 10% of Ally Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus in the case of any individual affiliate and 20% of Ally Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus in the case of all affiliates; (2) Ally Bank&#8217;s credit transactions with an affiliate are generally subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) with few exceptions, Ally Bank may not purchase any &#8220;low quality asset&#8221; from an affiliate; and (4) covered transactions must be conducted on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices (collectively, Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). In addition, transactions between Ally Bank and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are either substantially the same as or more beneficial to Ally Bank than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliates. 

##TABLE_END Furthermore, these laws include an attribution rule that treats a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonaffiliate as a transaction between Ally Bank and an affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of or transferred to the affiliate. Thus, Ally Bank&#8217;s purchase from a dealer of a retail installment sales contract involving a vehicle for which Ally provided floorplan financing is subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because the purchase price paid by Ally Bank is ultimately transferred by the dealer to Ally to pay off the floorplan financing. 

The Dodd-Frank Act tightened the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions in a number of ways. For example, the definition of covered transactions was expanded to include credit exposures arising from derivative transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and the acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral. For a credit transaction that must be collateralized, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires that collateral be maintained at all times while the credit extension or credit exposure remains outstanding and places additional limits on acceptable collateral. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Source of Strength &#8212; The Dodd-Frank Act codified the FRB&#8217;s policy requiring a BHC, like Ally, to serve as a source of financial strength for a depository-institution subsidiary, like Ally Bank, and to commit resources to support the subsidiary in circumstances when Ally might not otherwise elect to do so. The functional regulator of any nonbank subsidiary of Ally, however, may prevent that subsidiary from directly or indirectly contributing its financial support, and if that were to preclude Ally from serving as an adequate source of financial strength, the FRB may instead require the divestiture of Ally Bank and impose operating restrictions pending such a divestiture. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Single-Point-of-Entry Resolution Authority &#8212; Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a BHC whose failure would have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States may be subjected to an FDIC-administered resolution regime called the orderly liquidation authority as an alternative to bankruptcy. If Ally were to be placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC as receiver would have considerable rights and powers in liquidating and winding up Ally, including the ability to assign assets and liabilities without the need for creditor consent or prior court review and the ability to differentiate and determine priority among creditors. In doing so, moreover, the FDIC&#8217;s primary goal would be a liquidation that mitigates risk to the 

##TABLE_END

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

financial stability of the United States and that minimizes moral hazard. Under the FDIC&#8217;s proposed single-point-of-entry strategy for the resolution of a systemically important financial institution under the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would place the top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership, keep its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring them to a new bridge holding company, impose losses on the stockholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority, and address the problems that led to the institution&#8217;s failure. 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Enforcement Authority &#8212; The FRB possesses extensive authorities and powers to regulate and supervise the conduct of Ally&#8217;s businesses and operations. If the FRB were to take the position that Ally or any of its subsidiaries have violated any law or commitment or engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice, formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions could be taken by the FRB against Ally, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties (such as directors, officers, and agents). The UDFI and the FDIC have similarly expansive authorities and powers over Ally Bank and its subsidiaries. For example, any of these governmental authorities could order us to cease and desist from engaging in specified activities or practices or could affirmatively compel us to correct specified violations or practices. Some or all of these government authorities also would have the power, as applicable, to issue administrative orders against us that can be judicially enforced, to direct us to increase capital and liquidity, to limit our dividends and other capital distributions, to restrict or redirect the growth of our assets, businesses, and operations, to assess civil money penalties against us, to remove our officers and directors, to require the divestiture or the retention of assets or entities, to terminate deposit insurance, or to force us into bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership. These actions could directly affect not only Ally, its subsidiaries, and institution-affiliated parties but also Ally&#8217;s counterparties, stockholders, and creditors and its commitments, arrangements, and other dealings with them. 

##TABLE_END In addition, the CFPB has broad authorities and powers to enforce federal consumer-protection laws involving financial products and services. The CFPB has exercised these authorities and powers through public enforcement actions, lawsuits, and consent orders and through nonpublic enforcement actions. In doing so, the CFPB has generally sought remediation of harm alleged to have been suffered by consumers, civil money penalties, and changes in practices and other conduct. 

The SEC, FINRA, the Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other domestic or foreign governmental authorities also have an array of means at their disposal to regulate and enforce matters within their jurisdiction that could impact Ally&#8217;s businesses and operations. 

Basel Capital Framework 

The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have adopted risk-based and leverage capital standards that establish minimum capital-to-asset ratios for BHCs, like Ally, and depository institutions, like Ally Bank. 

The risk-based capital ratios are based on a banking organization&#8217;s risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which are generally determined under the standardized approach applicable to Ally and Ally Bank by (1) assigning on-balance-sheet exposures to broad risk-weight categories according to the counterparty or, if relevant, the guarantor or collateral (with higher risk weights assigned to categories of exposures perceived as representing greater risk), and (2) multiplying off-balance-sheet exposures by specified credit conversion factors to calculate credit equivalent amounts and assigning those credit equivalent amounts to the relevant risk-weight categories. The leverage ratio, in contrast, is based on an institution&#8217;s average unweighted on-balance-sheet exposures. 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) reached an agreement on the global Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States as well as related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (U.S. Basel III). U.S. Basel III represents a substantial revision to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. We became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015, although a number of its provisions&#8212;including capital buffers and certain regulatory capital deductions&#8212;were subject to a phase-in period through December 31, 2018. 

Under U.S. Basel III, Ally and Ally Bank must maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, and a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. In addition to these minimum risk-based capital ratios, Ally and Ally Bank are subject to a capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5%. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on the ability of Ally and Ally Bank to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. U.S. Basel III also subjects Ally and Ally Bank to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. 

U.S. Basel III also revised the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and provides for the phase-out of instruments that had previously been recognized as capital but that do not satisfy these criteria. For example, subject to certain exceptions (such as certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act), trust preferred and other hybrid securities were excluded from a BHC&#8217;s Tier 1 capital as of January 1, 2016. Also, subject to a phase-in schedule, certain items are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital under U.S. Basel III that had not previously been deducted from regulatory capital, and certain other deductions from regulatory capital have been modified. Among other things, U.S. Basel III requires significant investments in the common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing assets (MSAs), and certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) that exceed specified individual and aggregate thresholds to be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital. U.S. Basel III also revised the standardized approach 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

for calculating RWAs by, among other things, modifying certain risk weights and the methods for calculating RWAs for certain types of assets and exposures. 

In July 2019, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify the capital treatment for MSAs, certain DTAs, and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions (collectively, threshold items). Under the current capital rule, a banking organization must deduct from capital amounts of threshold items that individually exceed 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The aggregate amount of threshold items not deducted under the 10% threshold deduction but that nonetheless exceeds 15% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital minus certain deductions from and adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 capital must also be deducted. Any amount of these MSAs and certain DTAs not deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital are currently risk weighted at 100%. The final rule removes the individual and aggregate deduction thresholds for threshold items and adopts a single 25% Common Equity Tier 1 capital deduction threshold for each item individually, and requires that any of the threshold items not deducted be risk weighted at 250%. The final rule also simplifies the calculation methodology for minority interests. These provisions will take effect for us on April 1, 2020. We do not expect these provisions to have a significant impact on our capital position. 

Ally and Ally Bank are subject to the U.S. Basel III standardized approach for counterparty credit risk but not to the U.S. Basel III advanced approaches for credit risk or operational risk. Ally is also not subject to the U.S. market-risk capital rule, which applies only to banking organizations with significant trading assets and liabilities. 

The capital-to-asset ratios play a central role in prompt corrective action (PCA), which is an enforcement framework used by the U.S. banking agencies to constrain the activities of depository institutions based on their levels of regulatory capital. Five categories have been established using thresholds for the Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the total risk-based capital ratio, and the leverage ratio: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including any payment of a cash dividend or a management fee to its BHC, if the depository institution would become undercapitalized after the distribution. An undercapitalized institution is also subject to growth limitations and must submit and fulfill a capital restoration plan. While BHCs are not subject to the PCA framework, the FRB is empowered to compel a BHC to take measures&#8212;such as the execution of financial or performance guarantees&#8212;when PCA is required in connection with one of its depository-institution subsidiaries. In addition, under FDICIA, only well-capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits, and even adequately capitalized institutions are subject to some restrictions on the rates they may offer for brokered deposits. At December 31, 2019, Ally Bank was well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

At December 31, 2019, Ally and Ally Bank were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements. For an additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (CECL), which is further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CECL introduces a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under CECL, credit losses for each of these financial assets are measured based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of financial assets. In effect, this means that the financial asset or group of financial assets are presented at the net amount expected to ever be collected. CECL represents a significant departure from existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which currently provide for credit losses on these financial assets to be measured as they are incurred. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020, and substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity. In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing BHCs and banks, including Ally, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL. For regulatory capital purposes, this permitted us to phase in 25% of the capital impact of CECL on January 1, 2020, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2023. In addition, the FRB announced that, in order to reduce uncertainty, the FRB will maintain its current modeling framework for the allowance for loan losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 cycle. 

Prompted by the enactment of the EGRRCP Act, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued final rules that establish risk-based categories for determining capital and liquidity requirements that apply to large U.S. banking organizations. Refer to Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status earlier in this section. In April 2018, the FRB issued a proposal to more closely align forward-looking stress testing results with the FRB&#8217;s non-stress regulatory capital requirements for large U.S. banking organizations. The proposal would introduce a stress capital buffer based on firm-specific stress test performance, which would effectively replace the non-stress capital conservation buffer. The proposal would also make several changes to the CCAR process, such as eliminating the CCAR quantitative objection, narrowing the set of planned capital actions assumed to occur in the stress scenario, and eliminating the 30% dividend payout ratio as a criterion for heightened scrutiny of a firm&#8217;s capital plan. In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), many of which&#8212;if adopted in the United States&#8212;could heighten regulatory capital standards. At this time, how the FRB proposal and the Basel Committee revisions will be harmonized and finalized in the United States is not clear or predictable . 

Insured Depository Institution Status 

Ally Bank is an insured depository institution and, as such, is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC about its financial condition. Total assets of Ally Bank were $167.5 billion and $159.0 billion at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-K 

Ally Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the FDIC in the standard insurance amounts per depositor for each account ownership category as prescribed by the FDI Act. Deposit insurance is funded through assessments on Ally Bank and other insured depository institutions, and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DIF is not funded to its regulatory-mandated Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR). Currently, the FDIC is required to achieve a DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and has established a target DRR of 2.0%. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC assesses premiums from each institution based on its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity, while utilizing a scorecard method to determine each institution&#8217;s risk to the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of increasing its reserve for the DIF on institutions with consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion. To achieve the mandated DRR consistent with these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC implemented a rule in 2016 imposing a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on all insured depository institutions with consolidated total assets of $10 billion or more in addition to their regular assessments. Under the rule, the surcharge would cease once a DRR of 1.35% had been achieved or on December 31, 2018, whichever came first. On September 30, 2018, the DRR reached 1.36%, and the surcharge was eliminated. 

If an insured depository institution like Ally Bank were to become insolvent or if other specified events were to occur relating to its financial condition or the propriety of its actions, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver for the institution. In that capacity, the FDIC would have the power to (1) transfer assets and liabilities of the institution to another person or entity without the approval of the institution&#8217;s creditors; (2) require that its claims process be followed and to enforce statutory or other limits on damages claimed by the institution&#8217;s creditors; (3) enforce the institution&#8217;s contracts or leases according to their terms; (4) repudiate or disaffirm the institution&#8217;s contracts or leases; (5) seek to reclaim, recover, or recharacterize transfers of the institution&#8217;s assets or to exercise control over assets in which the institution may claim an interest; (6) enforce statutory or other injunctions; and (7) exercise a wide range of other rights, powers, and authorities, including those that could impair the rights and interests of all or some of the institution&#8217;s creditors. In addition, the administrative expenses of the conservator or receiver could be afforded priority over all or some of the claims of the institution&#8217;s creditors, and under the FDI Act, the claims of depositors (including the FDIC as subrogee of depositors) would enjoy priority over the claims of the institution&#8217;s unsecured creditors. 

Investments in Ally 

Because Ally Bank is an insured depository institution and Ally and IB Finance are BHCs, direct or indirect control of us&#8212;whether through the ownership of voting securities, influence over management or policies, or other means&#8212;is subject to approvals, conditions, and other restrictions under federal and state laws. Refer to Bank Holding Company, Financial Holding Company, and Depository Institution Status earlier in this section. These laws may differ in their purposes, definitions and presumptions of control, and restrictions, which for example is the case for the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire control of us in contravention of these laws. 

Asset-Backed Securitizations 

Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires securitizers of different types of asset-backed securitizations, including transactions backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and commercial, credit card, and automotive loans, to retain no less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets being securitized, subject to specified exceptions. Federal regulatory agencies issued final rules implementing this risk-retention requirement in October 2014, with compliance required for residential-mortgage securitizations beginning December 24, 2015, and for other securitizations beginning December 24, 2016. 

Automotive Finance 

In March 2013, the CFPB issued guidance about compliance with the fair-lending requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B. The guidance was specific to the practice of indirect automotive finance companies purchasing financing contracts executed between dealers and consumers and paying dealers for the contracts at a discount below the rates dealers charge consumers. In December 2017, the Government Accountability Office determined that the CFPB&#8217;s guidance constituted a rule under the Congressional Review Act. In May 2018, the guidance was disapproved and nullified under the Congressional Review Act by a joint resolution adopted by Congress and signed by the President. 

Insurance Companies 

Some of our insurance operations&#8212;including in the United States, Canada, and Bermuda&#8212;are subject to certain minimum aggregate capital requirements, net asset and dividend restrictions under applicable state and foreign insurance laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated by various U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. Under various state and foreign insurance laws, dividend distributions may be made only from statutory unassigned surplus with approvals required from the regulatory authorities for dividends in excess of certain statutory limitations. Our insurance operations are also subject to applicable state and foreign laws generally governing insurance companies, as well as laws addressing products that are not regulated as insurance, such as vehicle service contracts (VSCs) and guaranteed asset protection (GAP) waivers. 

Mortgage Finance 

Our mortgage business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, including related judicial and administrative decisions. These laws, among other things, impose licensing obligations and financial requirements; limit the interest rates, finance charges, and other fees that can be charged; regulate the use of credit reports and the reporting of credit information; impose underwriting requirements; regulate marketing techniques and practices; require the safeguarding of nonpublic information about customers; and regulate servicing practices,

including in connection with assessments, collection and foreclosure activities, claims handling, and investment and interest payments on escrow accounts. 

Through our direct-to-consumer mortgage offering, we offer a variety of jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products with the assistance of a third-party fulfillment provider. Jumbo mortgage loans are generally held on our balance sheet and are accounted for as held-for-investment. Conforming mortgage loans are generally originated as held-for-sale and then sold to the fulfillment provider , which in turn may sell the loans to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), or other participants in the secondary mortgage market. The nature and dynamics of this market, however, continue to evolve in ways that are often neither clear nor predictable. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship since September 2008. While the Federal Housing Finance Agency has published and pursued strategic goals for these government-sponsored enterprises during the conservatorship, their role in the market remains subject to uncertainty. Relatedly, during this same period, Congress has debated comprehensive housing-finance reform, but proposed legislation has yet to be meaningfully advanced. 

Ally Invest Subsidiaries 

Ally Invest Securities LLC (Ally Invest Securities) is registered as a securities broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, is registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board as a municipal securities broker-dealer, and is a member of FINRA, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and various other SROs, including Cboe, NYSE Arca, and Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, Ally Invest Securities and its personnel are subject to extensive requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), SEC regulations, SRO rules, and state laws, which collectively cover all aspects of the firm&#8217;s securities activities&#8212;including sales and trading practices, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, privacy, anti-money laundering, financial and other reporting, supervision, misuse of material nonpublic information, conduct of its business in accordance with just and equitable principles of trade, and personnel qualifications. The firm operates as an introducing broker and clears all transactions, including all customer transactions, through a third-party clearing broker-dealer on a fully disclosed basis. 

Ally Invest Forex LLC (Ally Invest Forex) is registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as an introducing broker and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA), which is the primary SRO for the U.S. futures industry. The firm is subject to similarly expansive requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act, CFTC and NFA rules governing introducing brokers and their personnel, and CFTC retail forex rules. 

Ally Invest Advisors Inc. (Ally Invest Advisors) is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. As a result, the firm is subject to a host of requirements governing investment advisers and their personnel under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and related rules and regulations, including certain fiduciary and other obligations with respect to its relationships with its investment advisory clients. 

Regulators conduct periodic examinations of Ally Invest Securities, Ally Invest Forex, and Ally Invest Advisors and regularly review reports that the firms are required to submit on an ongoing basis. Violations of relevant regulatory requirements could result in adverse consequences for the firms and their personnel, including censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and restriction, suspension or expulsion from the securities industry. 

Other Laws 

Ally is subject to numerous federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and other laws, and the possibility of violating applicable law presents ongoing compliance, operational, reputation, and other risks to Ally. Some of the other more significant laws to which we are subject include: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Privacy and Data Security &#160;&#8212; The GLB Act and related regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to safeguard specified consumer information maintained by them, to provide notice of their privacy practices to consumers in specified circumstances, and to allow consumers to opt out of specified kinds of information sharing with unaffiliated parties. Related regulatory guidance also directs financial institutions to notify consumers in specified cases of unauthorized access to sensitive consumer information. In addition, most states have enacted laws requiring notice of specified cases of unauthorized access to information. In February 2017, the NYDFS adopted expansive cybersecurity regulations that require regulated entities to establish cybersecurity programs and policies, to designate chief information security officers, to comply with notice and reporting obligations, and to take other actions in connection with the security of their information. On January 1, 2020, a comprehensive privacy law went into effect in the State of California, requiring regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information.

Volcker Rule &#160;&#8212; Under the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations of the CFTC, the FDIC, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC (collectively, the Volcker Rule), insured depository institutions and their affiliates are prohibited from (1) engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading,&#8221; and (2) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (covered funds) subject to limited exceptions. The final rules contain exemptions for market-making, hedging, underwriting, and trading in U.S. government and agency obligations and also permit the retention of ownership interests in certain types of funds and the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. In early 2017, the FRB granted us a five-year extension to conform with requirements related to certain covered fund activities. In late 2019, the regulatory agencies amended the Volcker Rule to simplify and streamline compliance requirements for firms that do not have significant trading activity, such as Ally.

Fair Lending Laws &#160;&#8212; The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and similar fair-lending laws (collectively, Fair Lending Laws) generally prohibit a creditor from discriminating against an applicant or borrower in any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of specified characteristics known as &#8220;prohibited bases,&#8221; such as race, gender, and religion. Creditors are also required under the Fair Lending Laws to follow a number of highly prescriptive rules, including rules requiring credit decisions to be made promptly, notices of adverse actions to be given, and, in the case of mortgage lenders of a certain size, anonymized data and information about mortgage applicants and credit decisions to be gathered and made publicly available. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act &#160;&#8212; The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the dissemination of credit reports by credit reporting agencies, requires users of credit reports to provide specified notices to the subjects of those reports, imposes standards on the furnishing of information to credit reporting agencies, obligates furnishers to maintain reasonable procedures to deal with the risk of identity theft, addresses the sharing of specified kinds of information with affiliates and third parties, and regulates the use of credit reports to make preapproved offers of credit and insurance to consumers. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Truth in Lending Act &#160;&#8212; The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation Z, which implements TILA, require lenders to provide borrowers with uniform, understandable information about the terms and conditions in certain credit transactions. These rules apply to Ally and its subsidiaries when they extend credit to consumers and require, in the case of certain loans, conspicuous disclosure of the finance charge and annual percentage rate, as applicable. In addition, if an advertisement for credit states specific credit terms, Regulation Z requires that the advertisement state only those terms that actually are or will be arranged or offered by the creditor together with specified notices. The CFPB in recent years has issued substantial amendments to the mortgage requirements under Regulation Z, and additional changes are likely in the future. Amendments to Regulation Z and Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, require integrated mortgage loan disclosures to be provided for applications received on or after October 3, 2015.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act &#160;&#8212; The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate-governance and accounting measures designed to improve the accuracy, reliability, and transparency of corporate financial reporting and disclosures and to reinforce the importance of corporate ethical standards. Among other things, this law provided for (1) the creation of an independent accounting oversight board; (2) auditor independence provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (3) additional corporate governance and responsibility measures including the requirement that the principal executive and financial officers certify financial statements; (4) the potential forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer&#8217;s securities by directors and senior officers in the 12 month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; (5) an increase in the oversight and enhancement of certain requirements relating to audit committees and how they interact with the independent auditors; (6) requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the issuer; (7) requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a &#8220;financial expert&#8221; (as defined by the SEC) and, if not, why the audit committee does not have a financial expert; (8) a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans made by insured financial institutions, on nonpreferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements; (9) disclosure of a code of ethics; (10) requirements that management assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and that the independent registered public accounting firm attest to the assessment; and (11) a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations.

USA PATRIOT Act/Anti-Money-Laundering Requirements &#160; &#8212; In 2001, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act) was signed into law. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act amends the Bank Secrecy Act and contains provisions designed to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, requires banks, certain other financial institutions, and, in certain cases, BHCs to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money-laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting on suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to certain requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.

Community Reinvestment Act &#8212; Under the CRA, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income persons and neighborhoods. While the CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs, banks are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities. In its most recent performance evaluation in 2017, Ally Bank received an &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; rating. In January 2020, Ally Bank began operating under a new three-year CRA strategic plan approved by the FRB. Failure by Ally Bank to maintain a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; or better rating under the CRA may adversely affect our ability to expand our financial and related activities as an FHC or make acquisitions.
