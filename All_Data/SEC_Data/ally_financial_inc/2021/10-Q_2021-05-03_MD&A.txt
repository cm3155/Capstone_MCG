(a) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Includes shares related to share-based compensation that vested but were not yet issued. 

(b) Due to the antidilutive effect of the net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020, basic weighted-average common shares outstanding was used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Refer to Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

(a) The ratios were based on average assets and average equity using an average daily balance methodology. 

(b) The common dividend payout ratio was calculated using basic earnings per common share. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we paid dividends of $0.19 per share and incurred a loss of $0.85 per share. Due to the relationship of this calculation and the net loss incurred, this ratio is not meaningful for the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

(c) Net interest spread represents the difference between the rate on total interest-earning assets and the rate on total interest-bearing liabilities. 

(d) Net yield on interest-earning assets represents annualized net financing revenue and other interest income as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. 

We became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015, although a number of its provisions&#8212;including capital buffers and certain regulatory capital deductions&#8212;were subject to a phase-in periods.

(a) Tier 1 leverage ratio equals Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets, which both reflect adjustments for disallowed goodwill, certain intangible assets, and disallowed deferred tax assets. 

(b) We have elected to delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

(c) Contains deferred tax assets required to be deducted from capital under U.S. Basel III. 

(d) Primarily comprises adjustments related to our accumulated other comprehensive income opt-out election, which allows us to exclude most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital. 

(e) Risk-weighted assets are defined by regulation and are generally determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet exposures to various risk categories.

&#8226; Our Dealer Financial Services business is one of the largest full-service automotive finance operations in the country and offers a wide range of financial services and insurance products to automotive dealerships and their customers. Dealer Financial Services comprises our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments. 

Our Automotive Finance operations include purchasing retail installment sales contracts and operating leases from dealers, extending automotive loans directly to consumers, offering term loans to dealers, financing dealer floorplans and providing other lines of credit to dealers, supplying warehouse lines to automotive retailers, offering automotive-fleet financing, providing financing to companies and municipalities for the purchase or lease of vehicles, and supplying vehicle-remarketing services. Our dealer-centric business model, value-added products and services, full-spectrum financing, and business expertise proven over many credit cycles make us a premier automotive finance company. Our success as an automotive finance provider is driven by the consistent and broad range of products and services we offer to dealers. The automotive marketplace is dynamic and evolving, including substantial investments in electrification by automobile manufacturers and suppliers. Ally remains focused on meeting the needs of both our dealer and consumer customers and continuing to strengthen and expand upon our 19,000 dealer relationships. We continue to identify and cultivate relationships with automotive retailers including those with leading eCommerce platforms. We also operate Clearlane, our online direct-lending platform, which provides a digital platform for consumers seeking direct financing. We believe these actions will enable us to respond to the growing trends for a more streamlined and digital automotive financing process to serve both dealers and consumers. Our strong and expansive dealer relationships, comprehensive suite of products and services, full-spectrum financing, and depth of experience position us to evolve with future shifts in automobile technologies, including electrification. Ally has and continues to provide automobile financing for hybrid and battery-electric vehicles today, and 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

is well positioned to remain a leader in automotive financing as we believe the vast majority of these vehicles will be sold through dealerships with whom we have an established relationship. 

The Growth channel was established to focus on developing dealer relationships beyond those relationships that primarily were developed through our previous role as a captive finance company for GM and Stellantis. The Growth channel was expanded to include direct-to-consumer financing through Clearlane and other channels and our arrangements with online automotive retailers. We have established relationships with thousands of Growth channel dealers through our customer-centric approach and specialized incentive programs designed to drive loyalty amongst dealers to our products and services. The success of the Growth channel has been a key enabler in evolving our business model from a focused captive finance company to a leading market competitor. In this channel, we currently have over 12,600 dealer relationships, of which approximately 84% are franchised dealers (including brands such as Ford, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda, and others), or used vehicle only retailers with a national presence. 

Our Insurance operations offer both consumer finance protection and insurance products sold primarily through the automotive dealer channel, and commercial insurance products sold directly to dealers. We serve approximately 2.5 million consumers nationwide across F&#38;I and P&#38;C products. In addition, we offer F&#38;I products in Canada, where we serve more than 400 thousand consumers and are the VSC and other protection plan provider for GM Canada and VSC provider for Subaru Canada. 

As a leading provider with a focus on offering dealers a broad range of consumer F&#38;I products, we offer VSCs, VMCs, and GAP products. We also underwrite selected commercial insurance coverages, which primarily insure dealers&#8217; wholesale vehicle inventory. Ally Premier Protection is our flagship VSC offering, which provides coverage for new and used vehicles of virtually all makes and models. We also offer ClearGuard on the SmartAuction platform, which is a protection product designed to minimize the risk to dealers from arbitration claims for eligible vehicles sold at auction. 

&#8226; Our Mortgage Finance operations consist of the management of held-for-investment and held-for-sale consumer mortgage loan portfolios. Our held-for-investment portfolio includes our direct-to-consumer Ally Home mortgage offering, and bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans originated by third parties. 

Through our direct-to-consumer channel, which was introduced late in 2016, we offer a variety of competitively priced jumbo and conforming fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage products through a third-party fulfillment provider. Under our current arrangement, our direct-to-consumer conforming mortgages are originated as held for sale and sold, while jumbo and LMI mortgages are originated as held for investment. Loans originated in the direct-to-consumer channel are sourced by existing Ally customer marketing, prospect marketing on third-party websites, and email or direct mail campaigns. In April 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with BMC, which delivers an enhanced end-to-end digital mortgage experience for our customers through our direct-to-consumer channel. Through this partnership, BMC conducts the sales, processing, underwriting, and closing for Ally&#8217;s digital mortgage offerings in a highly innovative, scalable, and cost-efficient manner, while Ally retains control of all the marketing and advertising strategies and loan pricing. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we originated $1.8 billion of mortgage loans through our direct-to-consumer channel. 

Through the bulk loan channel, we purchase loans from several qualified sellers including direct originators and large aggregators who have the financial capacity to support strong representations and warranties and the industry knowledge and experience to originate high-quality assets. Bulk purchases are made on a servicing-released basis, allowing us to directly oversee servicing activities and manage refinancing through our direct-to-consumer channel. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we purchased $188 million of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties. Our mortgage loan purchases are held for investment. 

The combination of our direct-to-consumer strategy and bulk portfolio purchase program provides the capacity to expand revenue sources and further grow and diversify our finance receivable portfolio with an attractive asset class while also deepening relationships with existing Ally customers. 

&#8226; Our Corporate Finance operations primarily provides senior secured leveraged cash flow and asset-based loans to mostly U.S.-based middle-market companies owned by private equity sponsors, and loans to asset managers that primarily provide leveraged loans. We believe our growing deposit-based funding model coupled with our expanded product offerings and deep industry relationships provide an advantage over our competition, which includes other banks as well as publicly and privately held finance companies. While there continues to be a significant level of liquidity and competition in the middle-market lending space, we have continued to prudently grow our lending portfolio with a focus on a disciplined and selective approach to credit quality, including a greater focus on asset-based loans. We seek markets and opportunities where our clients require customized, highly structured, and time-sensitive financing solutions. Our corporate-finance lending portfolio is generally composed of first-lien, first-out loans. Our focus is on businesses owned by private equity sponsors with loans typically used for leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, debt refinancing, expansions, restructurings, and working capital. Additionally, our Lender Finance business provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct-lending activities. The portfolio is well diversified across multiple industries including manufacturing, financials, distribution, services, and other specialty sectors. These specialty sectors include our Healthcare and Technology Finance verticals. The Healthcare vertical provides financing across the healthcare spectrum including services, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and medical devices and supplies. Our Technology Finance vertical provides financing solutions to 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

venture capital-backed, technology-based companies. We also provide a commercial real estate product focused on lending to skilled nursing facilities, senior housing, medical office buildings, and hospitals. 

&#8226; Corporate and Other primarily consists of centralized corporate treasury activities such as management of the cash and corporate investment securities and loan portfolios, short- and long-term debt, retail and brokered deposit liabilities, derivative instruments, original issue discount, and the residual impacts of our corporate FTP and treasury ALM activities. Corporate and Other also includes activity related to certain equity investments, which primarily consist of FHLB and FRB stock as well as other strategic investments, the management of our legacy mortgage portfolio, which primarily consists of loans originated prior to January 1, 2009, CRA loans and related investments, and reclassifications and eliminations between the reportable operating segments. 

Corporate and Other includes the results of Ally Invest, our digital brokerage and wealth management offering, which enables us to complement our competitive deposit products with low-cost investing. The digital wealth management business aligns with our strategy to create a premier digital financial services company and provides additional sources of fee income through asset management and certain other fees, with minimal balance sheet utilization. This business also provides an additional source of low-cost brokered deposits through arrangements with Ally Invest&#8217;s clearing broker. 

Corporate and Other also includes the results of Ally Lending. Ally Lending currently serves medical and home improvement service providers by enabling promotional and fixed rate installment-loan products through a digital application process at point-of-sale. The home improvement segment, which was launched in the second quarter of 2020, now represents nearly 20% of new originations, and is expected to grow. We believe the market outlook for point-of-sale lending provides attractive opportunities for future diversification, including in the automotive servicing and vehicle upfit space. Point-of-sale lending broadens our capabilities, and expands our product offering into consumer unsecured lending, all while helping to further meet the financial needs of our customers.

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, results were favorably impacted by lower provision for credit losses associated with improved macroeconomic conditions during the quarter and lower interest expense driven by lower market interest rates. This was partially offset by lower total financing revenue and other interest income driven by decreases in our commercial automotive revenue due to lower outstanding floorplan assets and lower benchmark interest rates, lower income from cash balances and investment securities, and higher prepayment activity within our Mortgage Finance operations. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income increased $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in net financing revenue and other interest income during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, was driven by lower market interest rates, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. Our total deposit liabilities increased $17.3 billion to $139.6 billion as of March 31, 2021, as compared to March 31, 2020. The increase in net financing revenue and other interest income was partially offset by a decrease of $146 million in our commercial automotive financing revenue. This decrease was driven by lower outstanding floorplan assets as a result of declining new vehicle inventories due to strong sales and ongoing production constraints from COVID-19, paired with a global semiconductor chip shortage driving sustained production headwinds throughout 2021 and as a result of lower benchmark interest rates. 

Other gain on investments was $123 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a loss on investments of $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in gain on investments for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily driven by favorable equity markets conditions during the quarter. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $916 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to reserve declines during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as the macroeconomic environment continued to recover. Additionally,

provision decreases during the three months ended March 31, 2021, were driven by lower net charge-offs in our consumer automotive portfolio as we continue to experience strong credit performance driven by favorable economic and operating conditions. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

We recognized total income tax expense from continuing operations of $211 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $92 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, was primarily due to the tax effects of an increase in pretax earnings.

Our Automotive Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $803 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $173 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the increase was due primarily to lower provision for credit losses and lower interest expense, as well as lower net depreciation expense on operating lease assets. The lower provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily driven by a reduction in reserves attributable to macroeconomic conditions. 

Consumer automotive loan financing revenue increased $49 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. Higher average consumer assets and higher portfolio yields contributed to the increase in revenue resulting from a continued focus on the used-vehicle portfolio primarily through franchised dealers and growth in application volume from our dealer network. Through these actions, we continue to optimize risk adjusted returns through our origination mix and achieve greater portfolio diversification. 

Commercial loan financing revenue decreased $146 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was driven by lower outstanding floorplan assets as a result of declining new vehicle inventories due to strong sales and ongoing production constraints from COVID-19, paired with a global semiconductor chip shortage driving sustained production headwinds throughout 2021. The decrease was also due to lower yields resulting from lower average benchmark interest rates. 

Interest expense was $413 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $589 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower market interest rates, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. 

Other income increased $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in remarketing fee income resulting from higher lease termination volume and an increase in late fee income due to a temporary suppression of late fees as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Total net operating lease revenue increased $88 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. We recognized remarketing gains of $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, while depreciation expense on operating lease assets decreased $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in net operating lease revenue was primarily driven by strong remarketing gains as a result of continued new vehicle supply constraints and an increase in demand for used vehicles, as well as a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from a downward adjustment of the rate of depreciation as we expect positive remarketing trends to continue in the near term. Refer to the Operating Lease Residual Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $788 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to reserve declines during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as the macroeconomic environment continued to recover. Additionally, provision decreases during the three months ended March 31, 2021, were driven by lower net charge-offs in our consumer automotive

Automotive Financing Volume 

Consumer Automotive Financing 

Our portfolio yield for consumer automotive loans, excluding the impact of hedging activities, increased approximately 24 basis points for the three months ended March 31, 2021, relative to the three months ended March 31, 2020. We set our buy rates using a granular, risk-based methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs, projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination, anticipated operating costs, and targeted return on equity. Our underwriting capabilities allow us to manage our risk tolerance levels to quickly react to major changes in the economy, including the current pandemic environment. Over the past several years, we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the used-vehicle segment, primarily through franchised dealers, which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio. Commensurate with this shift in origination mix, we continue to maintain consistent, disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.5 billion, or approximately 11.5%, of our total consumer automotive loans at March 31, 2021, as compared to $8.6 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2020.

Total consumer automotive loan and operating lease originations increased $1.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was driven by higher consumer demand, as well as increased application flow and decisioning speeds for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Average commercial wholesale financing receivables outstanding decreased $9.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower dealer inventory levels, driven by strong consumer demand for vehicles that outpaced lower automotive production levels due to COVID-19. Additionally, this decline in new vehicle inventories from ongoing production constraints from COVID-19 and the global semiconductor chip shortage may drive headwinds throughout 2021. Dealer inventory levels are dependent on a number of factors, including manufacturer production schedules and vehicle mix, sales incentives, and industry sales. Manufacturer production and corresponding dealer stock levels, as well as dealer penetration levels, may continue to influence our future wholesale balances. 

Other Commercial Automotive Financing 

We also provide other forms of commercial financing for the automotive industry including automotive dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing. Automotive dealer term and revolving loans are loans that we make to dealers to finance other aspects of the dealership business, including acquisitions. These loans are usually secured by real estate or other dealership assets and are typically personally guaranteed by the individual owners of the dealership. Additionally, these loans generally include cross-collateral and cross-default provisions. Automotive fleet financing credit lines may be obtained by dealers, their affiliates, and other independent companies that are used to purchase vehicles, which they lease or rent to others. The average balances of other commercial automotive loans increased $388 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, to an average of $5.7 billion.

(c) Management uses a combined ratio as a primary measure of underwriting profitability. Underwriting profitability is indicated by a combined ratio under 100% and is calculated as the sum of all incurred losses and expenses (excluding interest and income tax expense) divided by the total of premiums and service revenues earned and other income. 

Our Insurance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $141 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $105 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a $240 million increase in net investment gains and an $11 million decrease in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily as a result of lower weather-related losses from our P&#38;C business. 

Insurance premiums and service revenue earned was $280 million and $277 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021, included $16 million in higher earned revenue from our F&#38;I products, as revenue is earned over the life of the contracts on a basis proportionate to the anticipated loss pattern. The increase was offset by $13 million in lower earned premiums from our P&#38;C products, driven by lower dealer vehicle inventory levels. 

Other gain on investments, net was $98 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to other loss on investments, net of $142 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to improved performance within our equity securities portfolio, as results from the three months ended March 31, 2020, included $182 million in unrealized losses driven by unfavorable market conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to unrealized gains of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $63 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $74 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily driven by lower weather-related losses related to our vehicle inventory insurance business. Total acquisition and underwriting expense increased $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance commissions expense, commensurate with higher earned premiums from our F&#38;I products. 

The decrease in the combined ratio to 89.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to 91.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, was primarily driven by lower weather losses and higher earned premiums. In April 2021, we renewed our annual excess of

The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily due to higher F&#38;I volume and rate offset partially by lower P&#38;C premiums driven by lower dealer vehicle inventory levels due to strong retail sales and lower manufacturer production levels, which have been impacted by supply chain disruptions including shortages of semiconductor chips. While the severity and duration of these supply chain disruptions and other impacts associated with the ongoing pandemic on dealer inventory levels are not currently clear, we anticipate these circumstances may result in lower written premium levels within our P&#38;C business during 2021 commensurate with lower dealer inventory levels. 

Cash and Investments 

A significant aspect of our Insurance operations is the investment of proceeds from premiums and other revenue sources. We use these investments to satisfy our obligations related to future claims at the time these claims are settled. Our Insurance operations have an Investment Committee, which develops guidelines and strategies for these investments. The guidelines established by this committee reflect our risk appetite, liquidity requirements, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors.

In addition to these cash and investment securities, the Insurance segment has an interest-bearing intercompany arrangement with the Corporate segment, callable on demand. At March 31, 2021, the intercompany loan balance due to Insurance was $591 million and $830 million at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Our Mortgage Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily due to higher net gains on the sale of mortgage loans and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net financing revenue and other interest income, which was driven by higher prepayment activity, and an increase in noninterest expense. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in net financing revenue and other interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily due to accelerated premium amortization on purchased loans due to higher prepayment activity, driven by a lower interest rate environment. Premium amortization of purchased loans was $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we purchased $188 million of mortgage loans that were originated by third parties and originated $747 million of mortgage loans held for investment, compared to $484 million and $429 million, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

Gain on sale of mortgage loans, net, was $36 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was driven by higher direct-to-consumer mortgage originations and the subsequent sale of these loans to our fulfillment provider during the three months ended March 31, 2021. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we originated $1.0 billion of loans held for sale, compared to $300 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to reserve declines during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as the macroeconomic environment continued to recover. Additionally, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, provision decreased due to reserves declines associated with lower portfolio balances. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses.

Our Corporate Finance operations earned income from continuing operations before income tax expense of $53 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $68 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to lower provision for credit losses recognized during the first quarter of 2021, and higher other revenue primarily from investment gains. 

Net financing revenue and other interest income was $71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $68 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was due to higher average assets from continued growth in the portfolio and lower interest expense as benchmark interest rates decreased as compared to the prior year. The decrease in benchmark interest rates also drove a decline in interest and fees on finance receivables and loans, which was partially mitigated by base rate floors on the majority of the portfolio. 

Other revenue increased $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was driven by $10 million in investments income as compared to investment losses of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Investment income included both realized gains and upward adjustments to the fair value of certain nonmarketable equity securities. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $101 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to reserve declines during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as the macroeconomic environment continued to recover.

Corporate and Other incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax expense of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in loss was primarily driven by a decrease in total interest expense resulting from a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease in total financing revenue and other interest income. 

Financing revenue and other interest income was $108 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $207 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the impacts of a lower interest rate environment on the investment securities portfolio and hedging activities. 

Total interest expense decreased $170 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower market interest rates, which drove a decrease in our deposit rates, and our continued shift to more cost-efficient deposit funding. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases in the Ally Lending portfolio during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to reserve declines during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as the macroeconomic environment continued to recover. Additionally, the decreases in provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2021, were partially offset by reserve increases in the Ally Lending portfolio associated with continued portfolio growth. Refer to the Risk Management section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion on our provision for credit losses. 

Noninterest expense increased $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was driven by increased expenses to support the growth of our consumer product suite, as we continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities and portfolio of products. 

Total assets were $51.7 billion as of March 31, 2021, compared to $39.8 billion as of March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily the result of growth in our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities portfolio. The increase was partially offset by a decline in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio and legacy mortgage portfolio, primarily driven by loan sales in the three months ended December 31, 2020, and continued runoff. At March 31, 2021, the amortized cost of the legacy mortgage portfolio was $458 million, compared to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2020.

Risk Management 

Managing the risk/reward trade-off is a fundamental component of operating our businesses, and all employees are responsible for managing risk. We use multiple layers of defense to identify, monitor, and manage current and emerging risks. 

&#8226; Business lines &#160;&#8212; Responsible for owning and managing all of the risks that emanate from their risk-taking activities, including business units and support functions. 

&#8226; Independent risk management &#8212; Operates independent of the business lines and is responsible for establishing and maintaining our risk-management framework and promulgating it enterprise-wide. Independent risk management also provides an objective, critical assessment of risks and&#8212;through oversight, effective challenge, and other means&#8212;evaluates whether Ally remains aligned with its risk appetite. 

&#8226; Internal audit &#8212; Provides its own independent assessments of the effectiveness of our risk management, internal controls, and governance; and independent assessments regarding the quality of our loan portfolios. Internal audit includes Audit Services and the Loan Review Group. 

Our risk-management framework is overseen by the RC of our Board. The RC sets the risk appetite across our company while risk-oriented management committees, the executive leadership team, and our associates identify and monitor current and emerging risks and manage those risks within our risk appetite.

(b) Represents the current balance of conforming mortgages originated directly to the held-for-sale portfolio, and at March 31, 2021, also includes $138 million of adjustable-rate mortgage loans previously classified as held for investment. 

The risks inherent in our loan and operating lease exposures are largely driven by changes in the overall economy, used vehicle and housing prices, unemployment levels, and their impact on our borrowers. The potential financial statement impact of these exposures varies depending on the accounting classification and future expected disposition strategy. We retain most of our consumer automotive loans as they complement our core business model, but we do sell loans from time to time on an opportunistic basis. We ultimately manage the associated risks based on the underlying economics of the exposure. Our operating lease residual risk may be more volatile than credit risk in stressed macroeconomic scenarios. While all operating leases are exposed to potential reductions in used vehicle values, only loans where we take possession of the vehicle are affected by potential reductions in used vehicle values. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from an obligor not meeting its contractual obligations to us. Credit risk includes consumer credit risk, commercial credit risk, and counterparty credit risk. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Credit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us. Credit risk is monitored by the RCs, executive leadership team, and our associates. Together, they oversee credit decisioning, account servicing activities, and credit-risk-management processes, and manage credit risk exposures within our risk appetite. In addition, our Loan Review Group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and credit-risk-management practices and reports its findings to the RC on a regular basis. 

To mitigate risk, we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. This reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality. Our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios. This includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios, segments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas, loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses, and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures. Our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to regular stress tests that are based on plausible, but unexpected, economic scenarios to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic downturn. In addition, we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments (for example, nonprime) based on our risk appetite. 

Another important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns. When considering pricing, various granular risk-based factors are considered such as expected loss rates, loss volatility, anticipated operating costs, and targeted returns on equity. We carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception. We closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio. 

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, the source of repayment, the underlying collateral, and current market conditions. We monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers, various segmentations (for example, geographic region, product type, industry segment), as well as the aggregate portfolio. We perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive, consumer mortgage, consumer other, and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends. Refer to Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Additionally, we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress. For consumer automotive loans, we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment. In lieu of repossessing their vehicle, we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan. Loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms. For mortgage loans, as part of certain programs, we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers. These programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress, including maturity extensions, delinquent interest capitalization, changes to contractual interest rates, and principal forgiveness. 

Furthermore, we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty. Within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner. Counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives, securities trading, securities financing transactions, and certain cash balances. For more information on derivative counterparty credit risk, refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities. This team conducts industry and market research, monitors economic risks, and helps support various forms of scenario planning. This group closely monitors macroeconomic trends given the nature of our business and the potential impacts on our exposure to credit risk. The U.S. economy has started to recover from shutdowns that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. After peaking at 14.7%, as adjusted, in April 2020, the unemployment rate declined to 6.0% as of March 31, 2021. As a result of the economic disruption from COVID-19, sales of light motor vehicles fell to an annual pace of 8.7 million in April 2020, a 49-year low, before rising to a 17.7 million annual pace as of March 31, 2021. Future sales may moderate amid low new vehicle inventories. These low inventories have also raised used vehicle values. Additionally, used vehicle values may also be impacted by changes in customer preferences, including alternative transportation methods such as public transportation, vehicle sharing, and ride hailing. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio reflected our underwriting strategy to originate a diversified portfolio of consumer automotive loan assets, including new, used, prime and nonprime finance receivables and loans, high-quality jumbo and LMI mortgage loans that are acquired through bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer mortgage originations, as well as point-of-sale personal lending through Ally Lending. Additionally, credit performance of the consumer loan portfolio was impacted by fiscal and monetary stimulus deployed by governmental authorities to partially mitigate the adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic on households and businesses. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses represented approximately 11.5% and 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. For information on our consumer credit risk practices and policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, and charge-offs, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(b) Loans are generally in nonaccrual status when principal or interest has been delinquent for 90 days or more, or when full collection is not expected. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our accounting policies for finance receivables and loans. 

(c) Certain finance receivables and loans are included in fair value hedging relationships. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

(d) Includes outstanding CSG loans of $8.2 billion at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and RV loans of $978 million and $1.1 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

(e) Excludes finance receivables of $8 million at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, for which we have elected the fair value option. 

Total consumer finance receivables and loans decreased $1.8 billion at March 31, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020. The decrease consists of $2.2 billion of consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans, partially offset by increases of $330 million of consumer automotive finance receivables and loans and $83 million of consumer other finance receivables and loans. The decrease was primarily due to lower consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans as a result of loan pay-offs which exceeded bulk loan purchases and direct-to-consumer origination volume. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in consumer automotive finance receivables and loans primarily related to continued momentum in our used vehicle lending, as well as an increase in consumer other finance receivables and loans primarily related to Ally Lending loan originations which outpaced portfolio runoff. 

Total consumer nonperforming finance receivables and loans at March 31, 2021, decreased $91 million to $1.3 billion from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by our consumer automotive loan portfolio and was in line with expectations for this business. Refer to Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Nonperforming consumer finance receivables and loans as a percentage of total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans were 1.5% at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 

Total consumer TDRs outstanding at March 31, 2021, increased $207 million since December 31, 2020, to $2.2 billion. Results primarily reflect a $210 million increase in our consumer automotive loan portfolio. This increase is driven by an increase in deferrals offered through our established risk management policies and practices to customers subsequent to a COVID-19 deferral, where the loan modification in connection with other factors resulted in a TDR classification. Refer to Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Consumer automotive loans accruing and past due 30 days or more decreased $775 million to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, which was in line with expectations.

(a) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding finance receivables and loans excluding loans measured at fair value and loans held for sale during the period for each loan category. 

Our net charge-offs from total consumer finance receivables and loans were $104 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $264 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Net charge-offs for our consumer automotive portfolio decreased by $165 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by strong payment performance and delinquency trends in our consumer automotive portfolio through the pandemic, as well as a lower number of loans migrating to charge-off due to the COVID-19 loan deferral program. In addition, our net charge-offs continue to benefit from strong used vehicle prices which has reduced the realized loss impact in instances of default. While economic conditions have improved since the beginning of the pandemic, and we have taken a number of actions including the utilization of loan modification programs to support our customers and manage credit risk, we may incur higher charge-offs in future periods as a result of continued economic dislocation resulting from the impacts of COVID-19. 

The following table summarizes total consumer loan originations for the periods shown. Total consumer loan originations include loans classified as finance receivables and loans and loans held for sale during the period. 

Three months ended March 31, ($ in millions) 2021 2020 Consumer automotive $ 8,812 &#160; $ 7,849 Consumer mortgage (a) 1,784 &#160; 729 Consumer other (b) 211 &#160; 76 Total consumer loan originations $ 10,807 &#160; $ 8,654

(b) Includes acquired loans related to our Ally Lending business, for which we have elected the fair value option measurement. 

Total consumer loan originations increased $2.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was primarily due to growth in the direct-to-consumer mortgage business driven by the lower interest rate environment, as well as higher consumer demand and increased application flow and decisioning speeds in the consumer automotive portfolio. Additionally, originations for the three months ended March 31, 2020, were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which temporarily shut down or restricted operations at automotive dealers.

(a) Presentation is in descending order as a percentage of total consumer finance receivables and loans at March 31, 2021. 

We monitor our consumer loan portfolio for concentration risk across the states in which we lend. The highest concentrations of consumer loans are in California and Texas, which represented an aggregate of 24.3% and 24.7% of our total outstanding consumer finance receivables and loans at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our consumer mortgage loan portfolio concentration within California, which is primarily composed of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, generally aligns to the California share of jumbo mortgages nationally. 

Repossessed and Foreclosed Assets 

We classify an asset as repossessed or foreclosed, which is included in other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, when physical possession of the collateral is taken. We dispose of the acquired collateral in a timely fashion in accordance with regulatory requirements. For more information on repossessed and foreclosed assets, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Repossessed consumer automotive loan assets in our Automotive Finance operations were $133 million at March 31, 2021, and foreclosed mortgage assets were $2 million at March 31, 2021. 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the credit performance of the commercial portfolio remained stable as nonperforming finance receivables and loans decreased, and our net charge-offs remained low.

(c) Other commercial and industrial primarily includes senior secured commercial lending largely associated with our Corporate Finance operations. 

Total commercial finance receivables and loans outstanding decreased $3.6 billion from December 31, 2020, to $25.7 billion at March 31, 2021. Results primarily reflect a $4.0 billion decrease in our commercial automotive loan portfolio due to lower dealer inventory levels, driven by strong consumer demand for vehicles that outpaced lower automotive production levels due to COVID-19. This decrease was partially offset by a $299 million increase to commercial other loans within the commercial and industrial portfolio class, driven primarily by asset-based lending, mostly through our Corporate Finance lender finance vertical, which provides asset managers with partial funding for their direct lending activities. This decrease was also partially offset by $4 million increase in our commercial real estate portfolio. 

Total commercial nonperforming finance receivables and loans were $169 million at March 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of $8 million compared to December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the downgrade of two exposures to nonaccrual status within commercial other in our commercial and industrial portfolio class. This increase was partially offset by a decrease due to lower dealer inventory levels in our commercial automotive portfolio driven by lower production levels as automotive manufacturers work to return to pre-pandemic levels. Nonperforming commercial finance receivables and loans as a percentage of outstanding commercial finance receivables and loans increased to 0.7% at March 31, 2021, compared to 0.5% at December 31, 2020. 

Total commercial TDRs outstanding at March 31, 2021, increased $56 million since December 31, 2020, to $259 million. The increase was primarily driven by the restructuring of one exposure and an increase in the outstanding balance of an existing TDR within commercial other in our commercial and industrial portfolio class. Refer to Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The increase for three months ended March 31, 2021, was due to the partial charge-off of one exposure within our Corporate Finance operations. 

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial Criticized Exposure 

Finance receivables and loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful are reported as criticized. These classifications are based on regulatory definitions and generally represent finance receivables and loans within our portfolio that have a higher default risk or have already defaulted. These finance receivables and loans require additional monitoring and review including specific actions to mitigate our potential loss. 

Total criticized exposures decreased $901 million from December 31, 2020, to $3.1 billion at March 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower dealer inventory levels in our commercial automotive portfolio driven by continued lower production levels as automotive manufacturers work to return to pre-pandemic levels. This decrease was also driven by a lower number of special mention accounts within commercial other in our commercial and industrial receivables class.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020, as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The CECL standard introduced a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized costs. In contrast to the previous incurred loss model, CECL requires credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost to be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of assets. 

Under CECL, our modeling processes incorporate the following considerations: 

&#8226; a single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process; 

&#8226; a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over a 24-month period; and 

&#8226; data from the historical mean will be calculated from January 2008 through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Our quantitatively determined allowance under CECL is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, macroeconomic variables that our consumer automotive allowance for loan losses is most sensitive to include national and state unemployment levels. Our process for determining the allowance for loan losses considers a borrower&#8217;s willingness and ability to pay and considers other factors, including loan modification programs. In addition to our quantitative allowance for loan losses, we also incorporate qualitative adjustments that may relate to idiosyncratic risks, changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results such as the impacts associated with COVID-19. We also monitor model performance, using model error and related assessments, and we may incorporate qualitative reserves to adjust our quantitatively determined allowance if we observe deterioration in model performance. 

Through March 2021, forecasted economic variables utilized in our quantitative allowance processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations which included (but were not limited to) the following: the unemployment rate declining to approximately 5% by the end of 2021, before reverting to the historical mean of approximately 7% starting in the first quarter of 2024, stable GDP growth through 2021 as measured on a quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis, and stabilization of new light vehicle sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis to approximately 17 million units by the end of 2021. The overall improvement in the macroeconomic variables during the three months ended March 31, 2021, resulted in a decrease in the allowance for loan losses through our quantitative reserving process. Using our qualitative allowance framework, we reassessed and adjusted levels by incorporating uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which partially offset the decreases in reserves from our quantitative process. As a result, our overall allowance for loan losses decreased $131 million from the prior quarter to $3.2 billion at March 31, 2021, representing 2.8% as a percentage of total finance receivables as of March 31, 2021, compared to 2.8% as of December 31, 2020.

The allowance for consumer loan losses as of March 31, 2021, decreased $13 million compared to March 31, 2020, reflecting decreases of $24 million in the consumer automotive allowance and $13 million in the consumer mortgage allowance, partially offset by an increase of $24 million in the consumer other allowance. The decrease in our consumer automotive allowance was primarily driven by reserve declines associated with improvement in the macroeconomic environment as the economy has continued to recover, partially offset by higher reserves resulting from continued portfolio growth and higher reserves for TDRs associated with customer extensions granted for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in our consumer mortgage allowance was primarily driven by reserve declines associated with improvement in the macroeconomic environment as the economy has continued to recover. Additionally, the consumer mortgage allowance decreased due to lower portfolio balances for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in the consumer other allowance was primarily driven by continued growth within Ally Lending during the three months ended March 31, 2021, partially offset by reserve declines associated with improvement in the macroeconomic environment. 

The allowance for commercial loan losses decreased $80 million at March 31, 2021, compared to March 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by reserve declines within our commercial automotive portfolio associated with improvement in the macroeconomic environment as the economy has continued to recover, as well as reserve decreases due to lower commercial automotive portfolio balances for the three months ended March 31, 2021. 

The provision for consumer credit losses decreased $707 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for consumer credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases within the consumer automotive portfolio during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to reserve declines during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as the macroeconomic environment continued to recover. Additionally, provision decreases during the three months ended March 31, 2021, were driven by lower net charge-offs in our consumer automotive portfolio as we continue to experience strong credit performance driven by favorable economic and operating conditions. 

The provision for commercial credit losses decreased $209 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in provision for commercial credit losses was primarily driven by reserve increases within commercial automotive and Corporate Finance during the three months ended March 31, 2020, associated with deterioration in the

Market Risk 

Our financing, investing, and insurance activities give rise to market risk, or the potential change in the value of our assets (including securities, assets held for sale, loans and operating leases) and liabilities (including deposits and debt) due to movements in market variables, such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign-exchange rates, equity prices, and off-lease vehicle prices. 

The impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities (interest rate risk) represents an exposure to market risk and can affect interest rate sensitivities and cash flows when compared to our expectations. We primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 

The fair value of our credit-sensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk. Credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. Generally, an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 

We are also exposed to foreign-currency risk arising from foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily in Canada. We enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk. 

We also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities. We have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our Insurance operations. For such equity securities, we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values. Refer to Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We may experience changes in the valuation of these investments, which may cause volatility in our earnings. 

The composition of our balance sheet, including shorter-duration consumer automotive loans and variable-rate commercial loans, coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits, partially mitigates market risk. Additionally, we maintain risk-management controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis, and value at risk models. Refer to Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

LIBOR Transition 

In recognition of the significance of LIBOR cessation, Ally employs an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program that devotes numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates. Our program spans across impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition, while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers, products and instruments, and counterparty exposures. Through this program, we continue to assess and plan for 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties, financial forecasts, operational processes, technology, modeling, and vendor relationships. Our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our Board through the RC and certain executive committees, including the ALCO and the ERMC. For a more detailed discussion of our planned transition away from LIBOR, refer to the section titled Risk Management&#8212;LIBOR Transition in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We are evaluating the Prime rate and SOFR, among other alternatives and actions, as alternative reference rates for our customers, and are taking steps to assess the operational, financial, and various other impacts this change could have across each of our business lines. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we began offering conforming adjustable-rate mortgage loans using SOFR through our direct-to-consumer channel, which are held for sale. 

Net Financing Revenue Sensitivity Analysis 

Interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings. We use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments. 

We prepare forward-looking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth, asset/liability positioning, and interest rates based on the implied forward curve. The analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and non-contractual maturities. We continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing assumptions. 

Simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast. The changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity. Our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities. Our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates. 

The net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following 12 months. We test a number of alternative rate scenarios, including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve. Management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types. Relative to our baseline forecast, our net financing revenue over the next 12 months is expected to decrease by $34 million if interest rates remain unchanged. 

The following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net financing revenue over the next 12 months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 

March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Gradual (a) Instantaneous Gradual (a) Instantaneous Change in interest rates ($ in millions) ($ in millions) March 31, 2021 +200 basis points $ (29) $ (41) $ 70 $ 64

(27) (9) 32 68 -25 basis points (b) (44) (96) (3) (40) 

(a) Gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over 12 months. 

(b) Our models currently assume rates do not go below zero. 

The implied forward rate curve was steeper compared to December 31, 2020, as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve. The impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections. As of March 31, 2021, we expect an upward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario to have a modest negative impact to the baseline forecast, primarily due to a shift from floating-rate to fixed-rate assets, our continued shift in funding to retail deposits, and changes to our derivative hedging position. 

The exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario is largely driven by floating-rate assets and prepayment risk, as well as limited repricing of liquid deposits. 

Our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate debt instruments, and pay-fixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floating-rate debt instruments. We also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floating-rate assets. The size, maturity, and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet, ALM objectives, and interest rate environment evolve over time. 

Operating Lease Residual Risk Management 

We are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio. This operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

establishing the pricing at lease inception. However in certain instances, some automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure, as further described in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating lease portfolio, net of accumulated depreciation was $9.9 billion and $9.6 billion as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. For information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions, refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates &#8212; Valuation of Automotive Operating Lease Assets and Residuals within the MD&#38;A in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We recognized an average gain per vehicle of $2,114 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to an average gain per vehicle of $121 for the same period in 2020. The increases in remarketing performance were primarily due to continued new vehicle supply constraints coupled with increased demand. The number of off-lease vehicles remarketed during the three months ended March 31, 2021, increased 49%, compared to the same period in 2020. This increase is primarily due to lower remarketing activity in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases, and subsequently, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which furthered the reduction in vehicle remarketing activity during the second half of March 2020. We expect positive trends in remarketing performance to continue in the near term and, as a result, have adjusted the rate of depreciation expense to recognize lower lifetime depreciation on vehicles scheduled to terminate through June 30, 2022. We will continue to evaluate our depreciation rate for leased vehicles based on expected residual values and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the lease, if deemed necessary. 

Operating Lease Portfolio Mix 

We monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases. Our exposure to Stellantis vehicles represented approximately 87% and 91% of our operating lease units as of March 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 

The following table presents the mix of operating lease assets by vehicle type, based on volume of units outstanding.

Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital 

Overview 

The purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand, debt maturities, deposit withdrawals, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress. Our primary objective is to maintain cost-effective, stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles. Sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured market-based funding across various maturity, interest rate, and investor profiles. Additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities, committed secured credit facilities, repurchase agreements, and advances from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. 

We define liquidity risk as the risk that an institution&#8217;s financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. Liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institution-specific or market-related events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization. Effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events. Managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions. 

The ALCO, chaired by the Corporate Treasurer, is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies. Corporate Treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by ALCO and the RC. As part of managing liquidity risk, Corporate Treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds, executes our funding strategies, and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments. Oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by Independent Risk Management. 

Funding Strategy 

Liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and cost-effective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets. We focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors, lenders, and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles, including periods of financial distress. These funding sources include retail and brokered deposits, committed secured credit facilities, public and private asset-backed securitizations, unsecured debt, FHLB advances, whole-loan sales, demand notes, and repurchase agreements. Our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more cost-effective funding strategy over the long term. We evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles. 

We manage our funding to achieve a well-balanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk, maturity, and cost-of-funds characteristics. Optimizing funding at Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our long-term liquidity strategy. We optimize our funding sources at Ally Bank by growing retail deposits, maintaining active public and private securitization programs, managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio, utilizing repurchase agreements, and continuing to access funds from the FHLB. 

Essentially all asset originations are directed to Ally Bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements, and to utilize our growing consumer deposit-taking capabilities. This allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable long-term funding channel for the business, while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk, manage the liquidity position, identify related trends, and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits. These metrics include comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to 12 months, stability ratios that measure longer-term structural liquidity, and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification. In addition, we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans, evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers, review stress testing results, and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and risk-management accountabilities. 

Our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations, including unsecured debt maturities, for at least 12 months, assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe market-wide and enterprise-specific events. We maintain available liquidity in the form of cash, unencumbered highly liquid securities, and available committed secured credit facility capacity. This available liquidity is held at various legal entities, and is subject to regulatory restrictions and tax implications that may limit our ability to transfer funds across entities.

Recent Funding Developments 

During March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This global health crisis has resulted in economic disruption and volatility in the capital markets. While credit spreads for longer-term funding sources such as unsecured debt and ABS issuance increased significantly initially, FRB actions in response to the disruptions reduced credit spreads and improved market liquidity. These actions included providing significant quantitative-easing programs, expanding the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to include a wider range of securities, broadening the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, launching new funds and facilities to support employers, consumers and businesses, and establishing the Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility to facilitate ABS issuance of student, automotive, credit card, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. We continue to closely monitor market conditions, and actions taken by banking agencies to support general market liquidity. In recent years, we have become less reliant on market-based funding and believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our near-term funding needs. However, it is not currently clear to what degree the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future funding profile if market dislocation recurs. 

Key funding highlights from January 1, 2021, to date were as follows: 

&#8226; We terminated our demand note offering and as of March 1, 2021, we repaid all outstanding balances under this program. 

&#8226; We prepaid $88 million of unsecured term notes during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as we continue to shift our overall funding toward more cost-effective funding. 

&#8226; On April 22, 2021, we issued $1.35 billion of preferred stock, and announced our intent to use the proceeds to redeem in part the Series 2 TRUPS outstanding. 

&#8226; Our total capacity in committed secured credit facilities was reduced by $100 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as we continue to shift our overall funding toward a greater mix of cost-effective deposit funding.

In addition to providing customers with valuable products and digital services, retail deposits provide a key funding source for Ally Bank as it continues to diversify its funding profile and reduce its reliance on more expensive and rate-sensitive funding, providing our Automotive Finance, Mortgage Finance, Corporate Finance, and Ally Lending businesses with a stable and low-cost funding source. We believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility, or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources. In addition, we utilize brokered deposits, which are obtained through third-party intermediaries, including a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances. 

The following table shows Ally Bank&#8217;s total primary retail deposit customers and deposit balances as of the end of each of the last five quarters.

(a) Brokered deposit balances include a deposit related to Ally Invest customer cash balances deposited at Ally Bank by a third party of $1.9 billion as of both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, $1.8 billion as of both September 30, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2020. 

(b) Other deposits include mortgage escrow and other deposits. 

During the first three months of 2021, our total deposit base grew $2.5 billion and we added approximately 83,000 retail deposit customers, ending with 2.3 million retail deposit customers as of March 31, 2021. The growth in total deposits has been driven by strong growth in retail deposits, partially offset by a reduction in brokered deposits. Total retail deposits increased $4.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily within our online savings product, bringing the total retail deposits portfolio to $128.4 billion as of March 31, 2021. Strong customer acquisition and retention rates, reflecting the strength of the brand, continue to drive growth in retail deposits, as well as continued economic stimulus measures and strong consumer liquidity. 

As demonstrated by the launch of our smart savings tools in early 2020, we continue to advance our digital capabilities and deliver incremental value to our customers beyond competitive rates. In June 2020, Kiplinger named Ally Bank the &#8220;Best Internet Bank&#8221; for the fourth consecutive year, and in October 2020, MONEY&#174; Magazine named Ally the &#8220;Best Online Bank&#8221; for the eighth time in the past ten years. For additional information on our deposit funding by type, refer to Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Securitizations and Secured Financings 

While we primarily fund our business through deposits, we maintain a presence in the securitization markets to finance our automotive loan portfolios. Securitizations and secured funding transactions, collectively referred to as securitization transactions due to their similarities, allow us to convert our automotive-finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business. For additional details surrounding our securitization activities, refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks. Our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and, in some instances, on the execution of interest rate hedges. We maintain bilateral facilities, which fund our Automotive Finance operations. The facilities can be revolving in nature&#8212;generally having an original tenor ranging from 364 days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment period&#8212;or they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period. At March 31, 2021, all of our $460 million of capacity was revolving and of this balance, $175 million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than 364 days. 

We also have access to funding through advances with the FHLB. These advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities. As of March 31, 2021, we had pledged $12.8 billion of assets to the FHLB resulting in $11.0 billion in total funding capacity with $5.2 billion of debt outstanding. 

At March 31, 2021, $27.5 billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings. Refer to Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

Unsecured Financings 

We have short-term and long-term unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs. These programs are composed of callable fixed-rate instruments with fixed maturity dates. There were $275 million of retail term notes outstanding at March 31, 2021. In 2020, we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets four times, and collectively raised $2.8 billion through the issuance of senior notes composed of institutional term debt. We have also historically obtained unsecured funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes under our demand notes program. The holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction. On March 1, 2021, we terminated the offering of our demand notes program, and redeemed in full all outstanding demand notes. Refer to Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term unsecured debt. 

Other Secured and Unsecured Short-term Borrowings 

We have access to repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The securities sold in repurchase agreements include U.S. government and federal agency obligations. As of March 31, 2021, we had no debt outstanding under repurchase agreements. 

Additionally, we have access to the FRB Discount Window and can borrow funds to meet short-term liquidity demands. However, the FRB is not a primary source of funding for day-to-day business. Instead, it is a liquidity source that can be accessed in stressed environments or periods of market disruption. We had assets pledged and restricted as collateral to the FRB totaling $2.4 billion as of March 31, 2021. We had no debt outstanding with the FRB as of March 31, 2021. 

Guaranteed Securities 

Certain senior notes (collectively, the Guaranteed Notes) issued by Ally Financial Inc. (referred to within this section as the Parent) are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by IB Finance, a subsidiary of the Parent and the direct parent of Ally Bank, and Ally US LLC, a subsidiary of the Parent (together, the Guarantors, and the guarantee provided by each such Guarantor, the Note Guarantees). The Guarantors are primary obligors with respect to payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Parent in respect of the Guaranteed Notes pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture. At both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of the Guaranteed Notes was $2.0 billion, with the last scheduled maturity to take place in 2031. 

The Note Guarantees rank equally in right of payment with the applicable Guarantor&#8217;s existing and future unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness and are subordinate to any secured indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Note Guarantees are structurally subordinate to indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables and lease obligations, and in the case of Ally Bank, its deposits) of any nonguarantor subsidiaries of the applicable Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets of such subsidiaries. 

The Note Guarantees and all other obligations of the Guarantors will terminate and be of no further force or effect (i) upon a permissible sale, disposition, or other transfer (including through merger or consolidation) of a majority of the equity interests (including any sale, disposition or other transfer following which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a subsidiary of the Parent), of the applicable Guarantor, or (ii) upon the discharge of the Parent&#8217;s obligations related to the Guaranteed Notes.

Cash Flows 

The following summarizes the activity reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While this information may be helpful to highlight certain macro trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to liquidity, dividends, and ALM herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion and $814 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Activity increased year over year, as lower interest expense driven by lower market interest rates more than offset the decline in interest and fees on finance receivables and loans. Refer to the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this MD&#38;A for further discussion. 

Net cash provided by investing activities was $452 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $325 million for the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $4.9 billion increase in cash inflows related to originations and repayments of finance receivables and loans held for investment and other, driven by lower outstanding floorplan assets. New vehicle inventories have declined due to strong sales and ongoing production constraints from COVID-19 paired with a global semiconductor chip shortage driving sustained production headwinds throughout 2021. Additionally, we experienced an increase in repayments of consumer mortgage loans, driven by an increase in refinance volume resulting from the low interest rate environment. This increase was partially offset by increased cash outflows for security purchases. 

Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021, was $1.2 billion, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion for the same period in 2020. The change was primarily attributable to a decrease of $6.1 billion in net cash inflows related to short-term borrowings, as the continued growth of our retail-deposit base has contributed to a more favorable mix of lower cost funding. This activity was partially offset by a $1.9 billion decrease in long-term debt repayments, net of issuances. 

Capital Planning and Stress Tests 

Under the tailoring framework described in the section titled Basel Capital Framework of Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and exempted from mandated company-run capital stress testing requirements. We are also required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. Our annual capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on our capital. The plan must also include a detailed description of our process for assessing capital 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Ally Financial Inc. &#8226; Form 10-Q 

adequacy, including a discussion of how we, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with our risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, will serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank, and will maintain sufficient capital to continue our operations by maintaining ready access to funding, meeting our obligations to creditors and other counterparties, and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary. 

We submitted our 2020 capital plan in April 2020, which included planned capital distributions to common stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends over the nine-quarter planning horizon. In June 2020, the FRB provided us with the results of the supervisory stress test, additional industry-wide sensitivity analyses conducted in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement. As described earlier in the section titled Basel Capital Framework , we updated our capital plan in light of revised stress scenarios from the FRB and submitted our updated plan to the FRB in November 2020. In December 2020, the FRB publicly disclosed summary results of its second round of supervisory stress testing and extended its deadline for notifying firms about whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated to March 31, 2021. On March 25, 2021, the FRB further extended this deadline to June 30, 2021. 

In June 2020, the FRB announced several actions to ensure that large firms, such as Ally, would remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic, including for the third quarter of 2020 (1) the suspension of repurchases by any firm of its common stock, except repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans, and (2) the disallowance of any increase by a firm in the amount of its common-stock dividends and the imposition of a common-stock dividend limit equal to the average of the firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. These restrictions were extended by the FRB for the fourth quarter of 2020. In December 2020, the FRB extended and modified these restrictions for the first quarter of 2021 to limit aggregate common-stock dividends and share repurchases to an amount equal to the average of the firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters subject to specified exceptions. On March 25, 2021, the FRB extended these modified restrictions for the second quarter of 2021 and announced that, for a firm such as Ally that is not subject to the 2021 supervisory stress test and on a two-year cycle, the additional restrictions will end after June 30, 2021, and the firm&#8217;s stress capital buffer requirement based on the June 2020 supervisory stress test results will remain in place. The FRB, however, retains the discretion to change course and further extend these restrictions or impose different ones. On January 11, 2021, our Board authorized a stock-repurchase program, permitting us to repurchase up to $1.6 billion of our common stock from time to time from the first quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2021 subject to restrictions imposed by the FRB. 

In January 2021, the FRB issued a final rule effective April 5, 2021, to align its capital planning and stress capital buffer requirements with the tailoring framework. Under the final rule, unless otherwise directed by the FRB in specified circumstances, Ally and other Category IV firms are generally no longer required to calculate forward-looking projections of revenues, losses, reserves, and pro forma capital levels under scenarios provided by the FRB. Each firm continues to be required, however, to provide a forward-looking analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions that are designed by the firm. In addition, for Category IV firms, the final rule updated the frequency of calculating the portion of the stress capital buffer derived from the supervisory stress test to every other year. These firms have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test&#8212;and receive a correspondingly updated stress capital buffer requirement&#8212;in a year in which they would not generally be subject to the supervisory stress test. During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm would receive an updated stress capital buffer requirement that reflects its updated planned common-stock dividends. The final rule also includes reporting and other changes consistent with the tailoring framework. The deadline for electing to opt into the 2021 supervisory stress test was April 5, 2021, and Ally did not make such an election. 

We submitted our 2021 capital plan on April 5, 2021, which includes planned capital distributions to common stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends over the nine-quarter planning horizon and other capital actions. Our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, will continue to be subject to the FRB&#8217;s review and our internal governance requirements, including approval by our Board. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors, including Ally&#8217;s capital and liquidity positions, accounting and regulatory considerations (including any restrictions that may be imposed by the FRB), impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, financial and operational performance, alternative uses of capital, common-stock price, and general market conditions, and may be extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. 

Regulatory Capital 

Refer to Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the section titled Selected Financial Data within this MD&#38;A. 

Credit Ratings 

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by credit ratings, which are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company, security, or obligation. Lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. This is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investment-grade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for short-term debt (particularly money-market investors).

(b) Moody&#8217;s affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of Ba1, affirmed our short-term rating of Not Prime, and maintained a Stable outlook on May 12, 2020. Effective December 1, 2014, we determined to not renew our contractual arrangement with Moody&#8217;s related to their providing of our issuer, senior unsecured debt, and short-term ratings. Notwithstanding this, Moody&#8217;s has determined to continue to provide these ratings on a discretionary basis. However, Moody&#8217;s has no obligation to continue to provide these ratings, and could cease doing so at any time. 

(c) Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BBB-, affirmed our short-term rating of A-3, and changed the outlook to Stable from Negative on March 25, 2021. 

(d) DBRS affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating of BBB (Low), affirmed our short-term rating of R-3, and changed the outlook to Stable from Negative on March 4, 2021. 

Rating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, which may include capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current operating, legislative, and regulatory environment. Rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices&#8212;particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in rating methodology, as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment, and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We identified critical accounting estimates that, as a result of judgments, uncertainties, uniqueness, and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions. 

Our most critical accounting estimates are as follows: 

&#8226; Allowance for loan losses 

&#8226; Valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals 

&#8226; Fair value of financial instruments 

&#8226; Determination of provision for income taxes 

During 2021, we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the above estimates from what was described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Refer to Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting.
