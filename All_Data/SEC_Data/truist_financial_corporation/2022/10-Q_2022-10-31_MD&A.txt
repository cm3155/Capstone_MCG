 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, other information contained in this document, as well as with Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. A description of certain factors that may affect our future results and risk factors is set forth in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Regulatory Considerations 

The regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Truist is subject to banking laws and regulations, and various other laws and regulations, which affect the operations and management of Truist and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. Truist and its subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. The descriptions below summarize updates since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 to state and federal laws to which Truist is subject. These descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions. Refer to Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional disclosures. 

In March 2022, the U.S. enacted federal legislation that is intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty following U.S. dollar LIBOR&#8217;s cessation by replacing LIBOR references in certain contracts under certain circumstances with a SOFR-based rate to be established in a forthcoming FRB rule that incorporates a spread adjustment specified in the statute. While some states have already adopted LIBOR legislation, the federal legislation expressly preempts any provision of any state or local law, statute, rule, regulation, or standard. 

In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning on January 1, 2023. This rule is expected to increase regulatory premiums by approximately $100 million annually. The FDIC also concurrently maintained the Designated Reserve Ratio for the DIF at 2%. 

Executive Overview 

Our third quarter 2022 performance reflects strong progress in many areas of the business, as we delivered strong broad-based loan growth, significant margin expansion and continued exceptional asset quality. Overall financial results were mixed, however, as the challenging market environment impacted our capital markets related revenue. 

We continue to remain highly confident in Truist&#8217;s trajectory given the diversity of our business mix, our strong markets, conservative risk culture, and the substantial opportunities that lie ahead post integration. 

In July 2022, Truist launched Truist One Banking, a first-of-its-kind approach to the checking account experience, designed to address clients&#8217; direct feedback. Additionally during the quarter, we launched Truist Assist, an AI-enhanced virtual assistant within the mobile banking app and online banking platform; combining innovative technology with personalized human touch to enhance the client experience. We also announced the expansion of digital investment offerings with Truist Invest, a robo advisor, and Truist Invest Pro, a hybrid investing solution that combines automated investing with access to a team of financial advisors.

Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2022 of $1.5 billion was down 5.0% compared with the third quarter of 2021. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the third quarter of 2022 were $1.15, a decrease of $0.05, or 4.2%, compared to the third quarter of 2021. Truist&#8217;s results of operations for the third quarter of 2022 produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.19% and an annualized return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity of 10.7% compared to prior year returns of 1.28% and 10.2%, respectively. 

Results for the third quarter of 2022 included merger-related and restructuring charges of $62 million ($48 million after-tax) and incremental operating expenses related to the Merger of $90 million ($69 million after-tax). Results for the third quarter of 2021 included $172 million ($132 million after-tax) of merger-related and restructuring charges, $191 million ($147 million after-tax) of incremental operating expenses related to the Merger, and a one-time professional fee to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and roadmap teammate generated revenue growth and expense savings opportunities beyond the Merger of $30 million ($23 million after tax). 

On a TE basis, revenue was $5.9 billion for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $259 million, or 4.6%, compared to the same period in 2021. TE net interest income for the third quarter of 2022 was up $522 million, or 16%, compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to strong loan growth, higher market interest rates coupled with well controlled deposit costs and solid deposit growth. These increases were partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion and lower PPP revenue. Average earning assets increased $20.6 billion, or 4.5%, compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to growth in average total loans of $21.5 billion, or 7.4%. Average deposits increased $17.4 billion, or 4.3%, and average short-term borrowings increased $12.0 billion compared to the earlier quarter, while average long-term debt decreased $5.9 billion, or 16%. 

Net interest margin was 3.12%, up 31 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The yield on the total loan portfolio for the third quarter of 2022 was 4.49%, up 59 basis points compared to the earlier quarter, primarily reflecting higher market interest rates, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion and lower PPP revenue. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.95%, up 45 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to the higher rate environment. 

The average cost of total deposits was 0.31%, up 28 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average cost of short-term borrowings was 2.34%, up 166 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average cost of long-term debt was 2.43%, up 82 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The increase in rates on deposits and other funding sources was largely attributable to the higher rate environment. 

The provision for credit losses was $234 million, compared to a benefit of $324 million for the earlier quarter. The earlier quarter included a reserve release due to the improving credit environment during that period. Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2022 totaled $213 million compared to $135 million in the earlier quarter. The net charge-off ratio for the current quarter of 0.27% was up eight basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily driven by normalizing trends across certain consumer portfolios. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2022 decreased $263 million, or 11%, compared to the earlier quarter. Other income decreased $139 million due to valuation changes from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by lower personnel expense, and lower investment income and valuation marks from the Company&#8217;s SBIC and other strategic investments. Residential mortgage income decreased $107 million, or 60%, as lower production income (due to lower margins and refinance volumes resulting from the higher rate environment) was partially offset by higher servicing income (due to lower prepayments and servicing portfolio purchases). Investment banking and trading income decreased $94 million, or 30%, due to lower bond and equity originations and merger and acquisition fees, partially offset by higher trading income. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $80 million, or 12%, in insurance income due to organic growth and acquisitions. 

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2022 was down $182 million, or 4.8%, compared to the earlier quarter. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $110 million and incremental operating expenses related to the Merger decreased $101 million due to diminishing integration-related activities. The earlier quarter included a $30 million professional fee to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and roadmap teammate generated revenue growth and expense savings opportunities beyond the Merger.

Excluding the aforementioned items and the amortization of intangibles, adjusted noninterest expense increased $64 million, or 2.0%, compared to the earlier quarter. Other expense increased $81 million ($87 million, or 104%, on an adjusted basis) primarily due to increased operational losses and teammate travel expenses. Professional fees and outside processing expenses decreased $20 million, but was up $70 million, or 33%, on an adjusted basis due to increased project spend for enterprise technology investments and increased call center staffing. Equipment expense decreased $32 million ($38 million, or 25%, on an adjusted basis) primarily due to laptop purchases in the prior period. Software expense decreased $26 million ($24 million, or 9.6%, on an adjusted basis) primarily due to lower maintenance expense and decommissioned software. Personnel expense decreased $71 million ($32 million, or 1.5%, on an adjusted basis) due to lower other employee benefits as a result of the decrease in noninterest income for post-retirement benefits and lower incentives, partially offset by higher salaries due to annual merit increases, investments in revenue producing businesses and enterprise technology, as well as additional personnel costs for acquisitions. 

The provision for income taxes was $363 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $423 million for the earlier quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was 18.2%, compared to 19.9% for the earlier quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in discrete tax benefits and changes in the full year forecasted effective tax rate. 

Truist&#8217;s total assets at September 30, 2022 were $548.4 billion, an increase of $7.2 billion, or 1.3%, compared to December 31, 2021. Total loans and leases at September 30, 2022, were $316.6 billion, an increase of $22.3 billion, or 7.6% compared with December 31, 2021. The increase in loans reflects strong production during the second and third quarters of this year across most industry verticals and product groups in the commercial and industrial portfolio and the majority of the consumer portfolios. Total deposits at September 30, 2022 were $416.0 billion, a decrease of $496 million, or 0.1%, compared to December 31, 2021. 

Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting Truist&#8217;s prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment were 0.35% of loans and leases held for investment at September 30, 2022, down one basis point compared to June 30, 2022. The ALLL ratio was 1.34% compared to 1.38% for second quarter 2022. The ALLL coverage ratio was 4.98X annualized net charge-offs, versus 6.54X for second quarter 2022. 

Truist maintained strong capital and liquidity levels relative to the company&#8217;s risk profile. As of September 30, 2022, the CET1 ratio was 9.1% and the average LCR for the third quarter of 2022 was 111%. The decline in the CET1 ratio compared to June 30, 2022 primarily reflects the BenefitMall acquisition and strong loan growth. Truist increased its quarterly common dividend 8% to $0.52 per share in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 45% for the third quarter of 2022. Truist entered into an agreement to purchase BankDirect Capital Finance, the insurance premium finance unit of Texas Capital Bancshares, which is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2022. This will add approximately $3.2 billion in loans and deploys 15 basis points of capital. The acquisition will add scale and product offerings to our existing premium finance business.

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist&#8217;s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist&#8217;s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

Consumer Banking and Wealth 

CB&#38;W net income was $986 million for the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $53 million compared to the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income increased $495 million primarily driven by favorable funding credit on deposits attributable to the higher rate environment and higher average loan balances, partially offset by decreased loan spreads and lower purchase accounting accretion. The allocated provision for credit losses increased $288 million reflecting a reserve release in the earlier quarter and higher loan growth and increased charge-offs in the current quarter.

The allocated provision for credit losses increased $470 million which reflects lower allowance releases in the current period compared to the prior period, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in the current period. Noninterest income decreased $392 million primarily due lower high-yield bond originations, equity originations, merger and acquisition fees and loan syndications. Noninterest expense decreased $56 million primarily due to lower incentive expense tied to lower revenues as well as lower merger-related and restructuring charges and incremental operating expenses related to the Merger given diminishing integration-related activities in the current period, partially offset by investments in revenue producers. 

C&#38;CB average loans and leases held for investment increased $6.8 billion, or 4.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior year. Excluding a $6.7 billion decrease in average PPP loans, average loans held for investment were up $13.5 billion, or 9.2%, primarily driven by an increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio loans due to higher revolver utilization, partially offset by a decrease in average commercial real estate and commercial construction loans. 

C&#38;CB average total deposits increased $552 million, or 0.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to an increase in average noninterest bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in interest bearing deposits.

IH net income was $425 million for nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $21 million, or 5.2%, compared to the same period of the prior year. Noninterest income increased $320 million, or 16%, primarily due to acquisitions and organic growth. Noninterest expense increased $291 million, or 19%, primarily due to commissions on higher production and higher salaries in the current year along with higher amortization of intangibles and operating expenses related to acquisitions. 

Other, Treasury, and Corporate 

OT&#38;C generated a net loss of $1.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $1.4 billion in the same period of the prior year. Segment net interest income decreased $707 million due to higher funding credit on deposits to other segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the securities portfolio from the higher rate environment and growth in the securities portfolio. Noninterest income decreased $252 million primarily due to valuation changes from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by lower personnel expense, and losses on the sale of securities in the current year. Noninterest expense decreased $733 million primarily due to lower personnel expense due to lower other employee benefits as a result of the decrease in noninterest income for post-retirement benefits and lower incentives, charitable contributions to the Truist Foundation and the Truist Charitable Fund in the prior year, and lower merger-related and restructuring charges and incremental operating expenses related to the Merger. 

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Activities 

The securities portfolio totaled $131.7 billion at September 30, 2022, compared to $154.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease includes paydowns and maturities of $14.6 billion, as well as market declines of $14.2 billion, partially offset by purchases. In the first quarter of 2022, Truist transferred $59.4 billion of AFS securities to HTM as the Company continues to execute upon its asset-liability management strategies. As of September 30, 2022, 41% of the investment securities portfolio was held-to-maturity based on amortized cost. 

As of September 30, 2022, approximately 5.7% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, excluding the impact of swaps, compared to 4.6% as of December 31, 2021. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 6.8 years at September 30, 2022, compared to 5.8 years at December 31, 2021, excluding the impact of unsettled security purchases at period end. The increase in duration was driven by higher rates, resulting in slower prepayments and longer average lives for the MBS portfolio. 

U.S. Treasury, GSE, and Agency MBS represents 97% of the total securities portfolio as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. While the overwhelming majority of the portfolio remains in agency MBS securities, the Company also holds AAA rated non-agency MBS as the risk adjusted returns for these securities are more attractive than agency MBS.

Average loans and leases held for investment for the third quarter of 2022 were $309.4 billion, up $12.7 billion, or 4.3%, compared to the second quarter of 2022. 

Average commercial loans increased $6.3 billion, or 3.7%, due to broad-based growth of $6.6 billion, or 4.5%, within the commercial and industrial portfolio. 

Average consumer loans increased $6.3 billion, or 5.3%, due to a $4.0 billion increase in residential mortgages due to correspondent channel production and lower prepayments. In addition, indirect auto increased $1.6 billion primarily in the prime segment of the portfolio and indirect other increased $829 million primarily due to growth from the Service Finance, recreational lending and Sheffield portfolios, partially offset by runoff in other partnership lending programs. Residential home equity and direct increased $270 million, primarily due to growth from the LightStream portfolio. These increases were partially offset by $373 million of runoff in student loans. 

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 52% of loans and leases HFI were variable rate.

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.2 billion at September 30, 2022, up $67 million compared to June 30, 2022 due to an increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio and nonperforming loans held for sale. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment were 0.35% of loans and leases held for investment at September 30, 2022, down one basis point compared to June 30, 2022. 

Performing TDRs were up $180 million compared to the prior quarter primarily due to increases in the government guaranteed residential mortgage and the commercial and industrial portfolios. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2022, down $78 million, or five basis points, as a percentage of loans and leases compared with the prior quarter primarily due to a decline in government guaranteed residential mortgages. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.04% at September 30, 2022, flat from June 30, 2022. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing of $2.0 billion at September 30, 2022 were down $134 million, or seven basis points as a percentage of loans and leases, compared to the prior quarter primarily due to declines in the commercial and industrial and student loan portfolios. 

Problem loans include NPLs and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in Table 7. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. As a result, Truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on a loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR.

Net charge-offs during the third quarter totaled $213 million, or 0.27% as a percentage of average loans, and were up five basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by normalizing trends and seasonality across certain consumer loan portfolios. 

The allowance for credit losses was $4.5 billion and includes $4.2 billion for the allowance for loan and lease losses and $250 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.34% compared to 1.38% at June 30, 2022. The decline in the ALLL ratio was due to strong portfolio performance and growth in higher quality loans, partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook. The ALLL covered nonperforming loans and leases held for investment 3.80X compared to 3.84X at June 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the ALLL was 4.98X annualized net charge-offs, compared to 6.54X at June 30, 2022.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. Truist estimates credit losses on second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of September 30, 2022, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 32% of its second lien positions.

Sep 30, 2022 Jun 30, 2022 Mar 31, 2022 Dec 31, 2021 Sep 30, 2021 Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 146,041 $ 148,610 $ 145,933 $ 146,492 $ 141,738 Interest checking 111,645 112,375 112,159 110,506 107,802 Money market and savings 147,659 148,632 141,500 137,676 136,094 Time deposits 14,751 14,133 15,646 16,292 17,094 Total average deposits $ 420,096 $ 423,750 $ 415,238 $ 410,966 $ 402,728 

56 Truist Financial Corporation 

Average deposits for the third quarter of 2022 were $420.1 billion, a decrease of $3.7 billion, or 0.9%, compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in deposits was primarily driven by the impacts of monetary tightening, as well as higher consumer spending and seasonal patterns. Average noninterest bearing deposits decreased 1.7% compared to the prior quarter and represented 34.8% of total deposits for the third quarter of 2022. Average money market and savings and interest checking deposits declined 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter. Average time deposits increased 4.4% primarily due to an increase in negotiable certificates of deposit. 

Borrowings 

At September 30, 2022, short-term borrowings totaled $25.7 billion, an increase of $20.4 billion compared to December 31, 2021. The increase in short-term borrowings was primarily to fund $22.3 billion of strong loan growth since year-end. Average short-term borrowings were $11.4 billion, or 2.4% of total funding, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $6.1 billion, or 1.4%, for the prior year. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $31.2 billion at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $4.7 billion compared to December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company had maturities and redemptions of $5.9 billion of senior and $300 million of subordinated long-term debt and redeemed $800 million of FHLB advances, which resulted in a gain on early extinguishment of long-term debt of $39 million. The Company issued $2.4 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate between 4.12% and 4.26% due July 28, 2026 to June 6, 2028 and $1.0 billion fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes with an interest rate of 4.92% due July 28, 2033. The average cost of long-term debt was 1.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, up 29 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. 

In October 2022, Truist issued $750 million fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate of 5.90% due October 28, 2026 and $750 million fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with an interest rate of 6.123% due October 28, 2033. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $60.8 billion at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $8.5 billion from December 31, 2021. This decline includes a decrease of $10.7 billion in AOCI and $2.2 billion in dividends, partially offset by $4.6 billion in net income. Truist&#8217;s book value per common share at September 30, 2022 was $40.79, compared to $47.14 at December 31, 2021. 

Risk Management 

Truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner, and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. The risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables Truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the Company faces, both presently and in the future, and the Company&#8217;s position on managing risk to acceptable levels. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Compensation decisions take into account a teammate&#8217;s adherence to and successful implementation of Truist&#8217;s risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company&#8217;s compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Truist Financial Corporation 57 

Truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the residual risks associated with integrating heritage BB&#38;T and heritage SunTrust. While integration activities are largely complete, the Board and Executive Leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure appropriate oversight of application and data center decommissioning and residual integration activities, achieved through Truist&#8217;s risk management process.

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices. 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist&#8217;s strategic financial objectives. Truist&#8217;s most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in Truist&#8217;s business units. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk). 

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

Interest Rate Market Risk 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. To keep net interest margin as stable as possible, Truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities, and mix. Truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates. 

The Company&#8217;s simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments, and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. These assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to Truist&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The model also considers Truist&#8217;s current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes, projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance. 

Deposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. Truist applies deposit beta assumptions to non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. Truist utilizes a tiered deposit beta assumption framework that accounts for historically observed behaviors of clients and the Company. As interest rates rise, the deposit beta assumptions also rise to reflect increasing competition among banks as well as increased client demand for interest-bearing deposits. Based on the Federal funds target range at September 30, 2022 of 3.00% to 3.25%, Truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately 50% for any additional increases in the Federal funds rate. Truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position. The predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below. Table 17: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis Interest Rate Scenario Annualized Hypothetical Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Gradual Change in Prime Rate (bps) Prime Rate Sep 30, 2022 Sep 30, 2021 Sep 30, 2022 Sep 30, 2021 Up 100 7.25 % 4.25 % 0.37 % 4.08 % Up 50 6.75 3.75 0.39 3.15 No Change 6.25 3.25 &#8212; &#8212; Down 50 (1) 5.75 2.75 (1.77) (1.71) Down 100 (1) 5.25 2.25 (2.43) (1.94) 

(1) The Down 50 and 100 rate scenarios incorporate a floor of one basis point. 

Rate sensitivity decreased compared to prior periods, primarily driven by higher starting rates, higher deposit betas as rates increase and move into the highest beta tiers, and the addition of forward starting swaps. 

Management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. Much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Consistent with the industry, Truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. The behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of Truist. A decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of Truist&#8217;s balance sheet because the Company may increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source. Alternatively, the Company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterest-bearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheet&#8217;s asset sensitivity. 

The following table shows the results of Truist&#8217;s interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of additional demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits versus current projections under various interest rate scenarios. For purposes of this analysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%. Table 18: Deposit Mix Sensitivity Analysis Gradual Change in Rates (bps) Base Scenario at September 30, 2022 (1) Results Assuming a Decrease in Noninterest-Bearing Demand Deposits $20 Billion $40 Billion Up 100 0.37 % (0.29) % (0.96) % Up 50 0.39 (0.10) (0.58) 

(1) The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at September 30, 2022 as presented in the preceding table. 

Truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs, and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt, and other funding sources. Truist has utilized derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. As of September 30, 2022, Truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $336.1 billion, with an associated net negative fair value of $2.3 billion. See &#8220;Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; for additional disclosures. 

LIBOR Transition 

For most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the administrator of LIBOR extended publication until June 30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently by Truist, including one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR and all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR, ceased publication at December 31, 2021, based on the October 20, 2021 interagency Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR transition. To prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management formed a cross-functional project team to address the LIBOR transition. The project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to Executive Leadership and the Board. As of September 30, 2022, Truist had outstanding LIBOR-based instruments that mature after June 30, 2023, including loan and lease exposures totaling approximately $148 billion, notional derivative exposure totaling approximately $135 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion, and preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts, which contain adequate fallback language for the transition. 

Contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from LIBOR. Impacted lines of business have started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language, or amending contracts to new reference rates at maturities or based on client request. Current fallback language used to remediate contracts that mature after June 30, 2023 is generally consistent with ARRC recommendations and includes use of &#8220;hardwired fallback&#8221; language, which will transition loans to a SOFR based rate after June 30, 2023. 

Truist Financial Corporation 59 

The progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement. For commercial lending and general consumer lending, a significant number of remaining LIBOR contracts will require client outreach and remediation. Through mid-2022, the Company&#8217;s primary focus was contract remediation for maturities earlier than June 30, 2023 and expanding usage of alternative reference rates. Efforts have shifted to amend and remediate contracts, excluding mortgage and student loans, that mature post June 30, 2023 ($139 billion), which will continue to be the focus during the remainder of 2022. Truist has determined that adjustable rate mortgage products ($3.6 billion) have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from LIBOR in line with industry expectations; therefore, these contracts will not require remediation. Remediation of student loans ($5.2 billion) will follow pending guidance from the Department of Education on the replacement rate for payment allowances on certain student loans and recent guidance from the CFPB to allow transition to &#8220;comparable rates,&#8221; in the private student loan portfolio, where LIBOR is used directly. Certain derivatives without a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate will use the recent Federal legislation to replace LIBOR with a SOFR-based rate that will be established by FRB rulemaking and following the ISDA Protocol for transition. This legislation will also provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language and have not yet been remediated, providing a remediation path to a SOFR based rate. 

Training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during 2022. Truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during 2022 and the first half of 2023. Truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition. 

As of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased entering into new contracts with a LIBOR reference rate for all product offerings, except on a limited basis, as permissible. The Company is actively using SOFR as a reference rate and has originated approximately $80 billion of loans, issued $8.4 billion of long-term debt, and has $91 billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of September 30, 2022. Alternatives, such as SOFR, may react differently from LIBOR in times of economic stress. Truist expects SOFR to be the primary pricing benchmark used across the industry and will continue to offer additional SOFR based products. Market risks associated with the transition to alternative reference rates are dependent on market conditions as loans are transitioned to alternative reference rates during 2022 and early 2023. Additional alternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield will be supported based on market demand. Other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for LIBOR based on market developments. For a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of LIBOR and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled &#8220;Item1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Market risk from trading activities 

As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with Truist&#8217;s risk appetite. 

Truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule. 

Covered Trading Positions 

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the Company&#8217;s clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. Additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. See &#8220;Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; &#8220;Note 15. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies.

Securitizations 

As of September 30, 2022, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule was $23 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation Trading Positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of September 30, 2022. 

VaR-Based Measures 

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits. 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Average one and ten-day VaR measures for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased from the same period of last year, primarily driven by higher market volatility in 2022. Maximum one and ten-day VaR measures for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were lower than last year as heightened market volatility experienced during March 2020 was used for measuring VaR until March 2021.

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company&#8217;s trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures: Table 20: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Maximum $ 91 $ 82 $ 109 $ 91 Average 65 52 69 55 Minimum 48 31 40 26 Period-end 65 57 65 57 

Compared to the prior year, stressed VaR measures increased primarily due to higher market making inventory levels in 2022. 

Specific Risk Measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default or event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR Model Backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, VaR measures briefly increased in the first quarter of 2022 due to the increase in market volatility that normalized towards the end of the quarter. There were no Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. The total number of Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.

Model Risk Management 

MRM is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRM policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress Testing 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company&#8217;s comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist&#8217;s funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding, and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. 

Internal Liquidity Stress Testing 

Liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. The types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, and increased draws on unfunded commitments. To mitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment. 

Truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and Truist&#8217;s liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as HQLA under the LCR Rule. 

Contingency Funding Plan 

Truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization&#8217;s liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan&#8217;s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. 

LCR and HQLA 

The LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist Bank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational requirements of the LCR rule. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist held average weighted eligible HQLA of $88.6 billion and Truist&#8217;s average LCR was 111% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. 

Truist Financial Corporation 63 

Effective July 2021, Truist became subject to final rules implementing the NSFR, which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. At September 30, 2022, the Company was compliant with this requirement. 

Sources of Funds 

Management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Truist&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders&#8217; equity. Truist Bank&#8217;s primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. Available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity. The following table presents a summary of Truist Bank&#8217;s available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the FRB: 

Table 21: Selected Liquidity Sources (Dollars in millions) Sep 30, 2022 Dec 31, 2021 Unused borrowing capacity: FRB $ 49,525 $ 52,170 FHLB 28,548 49,244 Available investment securities (after haircuts) 

96,894 116,600 Available secured borrowing capacity 174,967 218,014 Eligible cash at the FRB 16,699 14,714 Total $ 191,666 $ 232,728 

At September 30, 2022, Truist Bank&#8217;s available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 3.7 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. FHLB unused borrowing capacity was $28.5 billion at September 30, 2022, down from $49.2 billion at December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company&#8217;s assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. See &#8220;Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions. 

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Parent Company had 32 months and 35 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 22 months and 19 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the Company&#8217;s ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. Credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. The Company&#8217;s credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends.

Recent changes in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings and outlooks include: 

On August 15, 2022, DBRS Morningstar upgraded the ratings of Truist, including the Long-Term Issuer Rating to &#8220;AA (low)&#8221; from &#8220;A (high).&#8221; DBRS Morningstar also upgraded the ratings of Truist Bank, including the Long-Term Issuer Rating to &#8220;AA&#8221; from &#8220;AA (low).&#8221; The trend for all ratings was revised to &#8220;Stable&#8221; from &#8220;Positive.&#8221; The rating actions reflected the scale, quality, and diversity of Truist&#8217;s franchise; the completion of the Merger integration; Truist&#8217;s diversified products and geography; and the Company&#8217;s sound balance sheet fundamentals and conservative risk profile. 

After the end of the third quarter, on October 21, 2022, Fitch Ratings affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank, including the long-term and short-term issuer default ratings at &#8220;A+&#8221; and &#8220;F1,&#8221; respectively, for both entities. Fitch Ratings also maintained a &#8220;stable&#8221; ratings outlook for all ratings. In affirming the ratings, Fitch cited Truist&#8217;s diverse business model, conservative credit culture, and the completion of the Merger integration. 

See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Truist&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings. 

Capital 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist&#8217;s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist&#8217;s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. 

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company&#8217;s capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management&#8217;s objective is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; minimums. Management has implemented stress capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist&#8217;s capital plan.

Under the 2022 CCAR process, Truist was notified its SCB requirement would remain 2.5% from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.

(1) Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist&#8217;s management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Capital ratios remained strong compared to the regulatory requirements for well capitalized banks. Truist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share during the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 8% compared to the prior quarter. The dividend payout ratio for the third quarter of 2022 was 45%. Truist did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter of 2022. 

Truist CET1 ratio was 9.1% as of September 30, 2022. The decline compared to the June 30, 2022 CET1 ratio primarily reflects the BenefitMall acquisition and strong loan growth.
