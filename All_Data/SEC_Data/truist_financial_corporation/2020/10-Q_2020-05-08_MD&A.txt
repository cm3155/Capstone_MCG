 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introduction 

This MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, other information contained in this document, as well as information contained in the December 31, 2019 Form 10-K. 

Government Response to COVID-19 

Congress, the FRB and the other U.S. state and federal financial regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from COVID-19 and can be expected to continue to evolve such approaches and requirements in ways that further impact the business of the Company. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or government programs summarized. 

The CARES Act 

The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Among other provisions, the CARES Act includes funding for the Small Business Administration to expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as troubled debt restructurings and a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. One of the key CARES Act programs is the Paycheck Protection Program, which temporarily expands the Small Business Administration&#8217;s business loan guarantee program through June 30, 2020. Paycheck Protection Program loans are available to a broader range of entities than ordinary Small Business Administration loans, require six-month deferral of principal and interest repayment, and the loan may be forgiven in an amount equal to payroll costs and certain other expenses during an eight-week covered period. 

The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings beginning on March 18, 2020 and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings effective March 27, 2020. Borrowers of federally backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the coronavirus-related public health emergency. 

Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds have been used to support the several FRB programs and facilities described below or additional programs or facilities that are established by the FRB under its Section 13(3) authority and meeting certain criteria. 

FRB Actions 

The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the FRB reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowing by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020. 

In addition, the FRB has established, or has taken steps to establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB, relying on its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. 

FRB facilities and programs established, or in the process of being established, include: 

&#8226; a Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to provide financing related to Paycheck Protection Program loans made by banks; 

&#8226; a Main Street New Loan Facility and a Main Street Expanded Loan Facility to purchase loan participations, under specified conditions, from banks lending to small and medium sized U.S. businesses; 

&#8226; a Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide liquidity to primary dealers through a secured lending facility; 

&#8226; a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to purchase the commercial paper of certain U.S. issuers; 

42 Truist Financial Corporation 

&#8226; a Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds directly from, or make loans directly to, eligible participants; 

&#8226; a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility to purchase corporate bonds trading in secondary markets, including from exchange-traded funds, that were issued by eligible participants; 

&#8226; a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to make loans secured by asset-backed securities; 

&#8226; a Municipal Liquidity Facility to purchase bonds directly from U.S. state, city and county issuers; and 

&#8226; a Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility to purchase certain assets from, or make loans to, financial institutions providing financing to eligible money market mutual funds. 

These facilities and programs are in various stages of development, and the Company and Truist Bank may participate in some or all of them, including as an agent or intermediary on behalf of clients or customers or in an advisory capacity. 

Regulatory Considerations 

The regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Truist is subject to banking laws and regulations and various other laws and regulations, which affect the operations and management of Truist and its ability to make distributions to shareholders. Truist and its subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators. Refer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional disclosures with respect to significant laws and regulations affecting Truist. 

The descriptions below summarize certain significant updates since the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 to state and federal laws to which Truist is subject. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. They do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions. 

Final Stress Capital Buffer Rule 

The FRB has adopted a final rule that integrates its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing regulatory capital requirements. For risk-based capital requirements, the stress capital buffer replaces the existing capital conservation buffer, which is 2.5% as of January 1, 2019. Under the final rule, beginning in the 2020 CCAR cycle, Truist will be required to calculate a stress capital buffer equal to the greater of (i) the difference between its starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount of Truist&#8217;s planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. 

The final rule also makes related changes to the capital planning and stress testing process. Among other changes, the revised capital plan rule eliminates the assumption that Truist&#8217;s balance sheet assets would increase over the planning horizon. In addition, provided that Truist is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the FRB&#8217;s capital rules, Truist will no longer be required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan. 

Revisions to Definition of Eligible Retained Income 

The U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules. Under the new rule, eligible retained income is the greater of a firm&#8217;s (i) net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (ii) average net income over the preceding four quarters. This definition applies with respect to all of Truist&#8217;s capital requirements. The interim final rule became effective March 20, 2020. 

Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology 

The U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule that permits banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020 to elect to follow the three-year transition available under the prior rule or a new five-year transition to phase in the effects of CECL on regulatory capital. Under the five-year transition, the banking organization would defer for two years 100% of the day-one effect of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative increase in the allowance for credit losses since adoption of CECL. Following the first two years, the electing organization will phase out the aggregate capital effects over the next three years consistent with the transition in the original three-year transition rule. The interim final rule became effective March 31, 2020. Truist has elected to use the five-year transition to phase in the impacts of CECL on regulatory capital.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB has adopted an interim final rule that temporarily changes the supplementary leverage ratio to exclude U.S. treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of a firm&#8217;s leverage exposure. The interim final rule applies to BHCs and became effective April 1, 2020 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2021. 

Loan modifications 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, banking regulators have encouraged financial institutions to work with borrowers. Truist implemented loan modification programs in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. These loan modifications are not considered TDRs to the extent that the borrower was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and was less than 30 days past due at the time that the COVID-19 loan modification program was implemented, unless the loan was previously classified as a TDR. 

CARES Act 

In addition to authorizing several programs to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible organizations, states and municipalities affected by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act also includes several measures that temporarily adjust existing laws or regulations. These include providing the FDIC with additional authority to guarantee the deposits of solvent insured depository institutions held in noninterest-bearing business transaction accounts to a maximum amount specified by the FDIC, reinstating the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Authority to guarantee debt obligations of solvent insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, and temporarily allowing the Treasury to fully guarantee money market mutual funds. The CARES Act also provides financial institutions with the option to suspend certain GAAP requirements for coronavirus-related loan modifications that would otherwise constitute troubled debt restructurings and further requires the federal banking agencies to defer to financial institutions&#8217; determinations in making such suspensions. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for Truist&#8217;s policy related to COVID-19 loan modifications. 

Executive Overview 

Overview of Significant Events and Financial Results 

Recent Events 

Effective December 6, 2019, the Company completed the Merger. Reported results for Truist reflect heritage BB&#38;T prior to the completion of the Merger and results from both BB&#38;T and SunTrust from the Merger closing date forward. As such, comparative income statement data in 

this MD&#38;A for the first quarter of 2019 is only for heritage BB&#38;T. Significant Merger updates include: 

&#8226; In January 2020, Truist officially launched the Truist brand and visual identity, and Truist&#8217;s purpose: &#8220;Inspire and build better lives and communities,&#8221; along with its mission and values. 

&#8226; In March 2020, the purchase of the new Charlotte, NC headquarters building was completed and the building was renamed Truist Center. 

&#8226; Purchase accounting valuations for loans and intangibles were updated during the first quarter resulting in a $193 million reduction in the fair value mark for loans, a $165 million increase in CDI and other intangibles and a $258 million reduction in goodwill. 

&#8226; Truist remains committed to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves. 

&#9702; The realization of net cost savings is conditioned on the duration of the pandemic and post-crisis economic conditions, including the normalization of interest rates. 

The Company is closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on clients, counterparties and the financial markets in which the Company conducts business. The Company expects the effects of this widespread health crisis, which include disruptions or restrictions in clients&#8217; supply chains, closures of clients&#8217; facilities or decreases in demand for clients&#8217; products and services, to adversely impact economic conditions. Also related to the health crisis, the U.S. has been operating under a presidential declared emergency since March 13, 2020, with various actions by the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies. 

Truist acted swiftly to support our clients, teammates and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following are some of the more significant actions related to our crisis response. 

&#8226; Provided support for clients through payment relief assistance, waiving certain fees and offering additional incentives, including: 

&#9702; Commercial - clients may elect to defer their loan payments for up to 90 days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges continuing to accrue. Similar payment deferrals were offered to commercial leasing clients upon request. 

&#9702; Consumer - clients may elect to defer loan payments for time periods that range from 30 to 90 days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges generally continuing to accrue. 

44 Truist Financial Corporation 

&#9702; Credit card - clients may elect to defer payments for up to 90 days without late fees being incurred but with financing charges accruing. In addition, Truist is providing credit card clients with 5% cash back on qualifying card purchases for certain important basic needs. 

&#8226; Truist implemented multiple strategies to keep our branches operational and clients safe, including lobby access by appointment and the extensive use of drive-thrus. Truist created an online, automated process for the Paycheck Protection Program and began to accept applications during the first weekend of the program. Additionally, Truist funded extensive line draws for commercial clients to help them fund liquidity and working capital needs. 

&#8226; Provided support for teammates including additional paid time off, flexibility and family care benefits. Provided teammates who have base pay below $100,000 annually a one-time pre-tax bonus of $1,200 in March to recognize their ongoing commitment to our clients and help alleviate some of the financial pressures caused by the pandemic. Enabled alternative work strategies that allowed more than half of our teammates to work remotely. Offered an additional onsite special pay rate of $6.25 per hour or $50 per day for teammates required to work in offices. 

&#8226; Launched the Truist Cares initiative, a pledge of $25 million in philanthropic support that is providing aid for basic needs, medical supplies, and financial hardship across the nation. The remaining charitable funds will be given as grants to Truist&#8217;s community partners to support and expand technology initiatives and programs for youth, seniors, small businesses and people to rebuild, restore and create thriving communities. 

See Part II, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding risks related to the effects of COVID-19. 

Financial Results 

Net income available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $986 million. On a diluted per common share basis, earnings for the first quarter of 2020 were $0.73, a decrease of $0.24 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Truist's results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 produced an annualized return on average assets of 0.90% and an annualized return on average common shareholders' equity of 6.58% compared to prior year ratios of 1.43% and 11.08%, respectively. Results for the first quarter of 2020 included merger-related and restructuring charges of $107 million ($82 million after-tax), incremental operating expenses related to the merger of $74 million ($57 million after-tax), and impacts associated with certain discretionary actions undertaken by management related to COVID-19 of $71 million ($54 million after-tax). Results for the first quarter of 2019 included $80 million ($64 million after-tax) of merger-related and restructuring charges and $2 million ($1 million after-tax) of incremental operating expenses related to the Merger. 

&#160; 

Truist&#8217;s revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $5.6 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was also $5.6 billion for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.7 billion compared to the same period in 2019, which reflects an increase of $2.0 billion in TE net interest income and an increase of $759 million in noninterest income. 

The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the Merger, as average loans and leases increased $159.0 billion and average securities increased $29.0 billion. In addition, average interest earning trading assets and other earning assets increased $27.9 billion due to higher trading assets from the Merger and higher interest bearing balances at the Federal Reserve as Truist increased liquidity to support clients. 

NIM was 3.58% for the first quarter of 2020, up 7 basis points compared to the prior year. Average earning assets increased $215.8 billion, while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $170.3 billion and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $40.9 billion. The annualized TE yield on the total loan portfolio for the first quarter of 2020 was 4.98%, down 8 basis points compared to the prior year. The annualized TE yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.62%, up 2 basis points compared to the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $893 million compared to $155 million for the first quarter of 2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the recognition of an economic downturn and significant growth in loans related to COVID-19, including the impact of reserving for the expected losses under CECL. Higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the Merger. Net charge-offs were 0.36% of average loans and leases on an annualized basis for the first quarter of 2020, down four basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2020 increased $759 million compared to the earlier quarter. Nearly all categories of noninterest income were impacted by the Merger. In addition to impacts from the Merger, insurance income increased due to higher production and residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the declining rate environment. Investment banking and trading income was negatively impacted by credit valuation adjustments on the derivatives portfolio primarily due to the decline in interest rates and widening of credit spreads. 

Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2020 was up $1.7 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, incremental operating expenses related to the Merger and certain discretionary expenses related to COVID-19, noninterest expense was up $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the Merger. 

Truist Financial Corporation 45 

The provision for income taxes was $224 million for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $177 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 of 17.4%, compared to 18.2% for the earlier quarter. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to higher income tax credits in the current year. 

Truist's total assets at March 31, 2020 were $506.2 billion, an increase of $33.1 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The increase in total assets was primarily driven by an increase of $15.8 billion in total loans and leases as many commercial clients drew on lines of credit to build liquidity in response to COVID-19 and an increase of $16.1 billion in interest-bearing deposits with banks, which primarily reflects higher balances held at the Federal Reserve. 

Total deposits at March 31, 2020 were $350.2 billion, an increase of $15.5 billion compared to December 31, 2019. The growth in deposits reflects clients retaining a portion of their credit line draws in the bank and solid growth in all non-time deposit products. 

Asset quality remained strong, although significant uncertainties exist related to COVID-19. As of March 31, 2020, nonperforming assets were 0.23% of total assets. The allowance for loan and lease loss coverage ratio was 5.04X nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 3.41X at December 31, 2019. The higher coverage ratio reflects the CECL adoption build of $3.1 billion, as well as $582 million of reserve build in the first quarter of 2020 in connection with COVID-19 and the economic downturn. 

Truist maintained strong capital and liquidity. As of March 31, 2020, the CET1 ratio was 9.3% and the average LCR was 117%. During the first quarter of 2020, the company redeemed $500 million of Series K preferred stock. Additionally, the Company issued $4.3 billion of senior and subordinated long-term debt. Truist declared common dividends of $0.450 per share during the first quarter of 2020. The dividend and total payout ratios for the first quarter of 2020 were 61.4 percent. As previously communicated at the time of the Merger announcement, Truist suspended its share repurchase program until capital ratios return to higher levels. In April 2020, Truist declared common dividends of $0.450 per share for the second quarter of 2020. 

Analysis of Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income and NIM 

First Quarter 2020 compared to First Quarter 2019 

&#160; 

Net interest income on a TE basis was $3.7 billion for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.0 billion compared to the same period in 2019. Interest income increased $2.3 billion. Interest expense increased $299 million. Net interest margin was 3.58%, up seven basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets increased $215.8 billion. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $159.0 billion increase in average total loans and leases and a $29.0 billion increase in average securities. Average interest earning trading assets and other earning assets increased $27.9 billion due to higher trading securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $170.3 billion compared to the earlier quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $133.8 billion, average long-term debt increased $23.3 billion and average short-term borrowings increased $13.3 billion. 

The yield on the total loan portfolio for the first quarter of 2020 was 4.98%, down eight basis points compared to the earlier quarter, reflecting the impact of rate decreases, partially offset by purchase accounting accretion from merged loans. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.62%, up two basis points compared to the earlier period. 

The average cost of total deposits was 0.51%, down 13 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.70%, down 25 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on short-term borrowings was 1.76%, down 56 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average rate on long-term debt was 2.34%, down 96 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect declines in fed funds and LIBOR rates. The lower rates on long-term debt also reflect the amortization of the fair value mark on the assumed debt and the recent issuance of new senior and subordinated notes and long-term FHLB advances. 

As of March 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt were $3.5 billion, $54 million and $285 million respectively. These amounts will be recognized over the remaining contractual lives of the underlying instruments or as prepayments occur. 

The major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.

Provision for Credit Losses 

First Quarter 2020 compared to First Quarter 2019 

&#160; 

The provision for credit losses was $893 million, compared to $155 million for the earlier quarter. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to the recognition of an economic downturn and significant growth in loans related to COVID-19, including the impact of reserving for the expected losses under CECL. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $272 million compared to $147 million in the earlier quarter. Higher net charge-offs also contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses and primarily reflect increases as a result of the Merger. The net charge-off rate for the current quarter of 0.36% was down four basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist's financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist's reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.

First Quarter 2020 compared to First Quarter 2019 

Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2020 increased $759 million compared to the earlier quarter. Nearly all categories of noninterest income were impacted by the Merger. Insurance income increased $39 million due to higher production. Residential mortgage banking income was up due to strong production and refinance activity driven by the declining rate environment. Investment banking and trading income was up $91 million, but was negatively impacted by credit valuation adjustments of $92 million on the derivatives portfolio primarily related to the decline in interest rates and widening of credit spreads. Other income was worse by $58 million, primarily as a result of a $26 million change in the market value of assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which was primarily offset by lower personnel expense.

First Quarter 2020 compared to First Quarter 2019 

&#160; 

Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2020 was up $1.7 billion compared to the earlier quarter. All categories of noninterest expense reflect the impact of the Merger. Merger-related and restructuring charges and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $27 million and $72 million, respectively. In addition, the current quarter was impacted by $65 million of discretionary expenses related to COVID-19. On an adjusted basis, noninterest expense was up $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the Merger. Marketing and customer development expense reflects higher spend related to the launch of the Truist brand. Amortization of intangibles increased $133 million due to the intangibles recognized in the Merger.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Average loans and leases held for investment for the first quarter of 2020 were $301.1 billion, up $110.8 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the merged loans and the line draws in response to COVID-19. Excluding the impact from these items, average loans were down slightly due to a decline in residential mortgage loans as a result of transferring loans to held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by increases in indirect automobile loans and student loans. 

COVID-19 Lending Activities 

The CARES Act includes provisions that were designed to encourage financial institutions to practice prudent efforts to work with borrowers impacted by COVID-19. These modifications are generally not considered a TDR as disclosed in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation.&#8221; Truist payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. Through the end of April, Truist had the following client accomodation activity in response to COVID-19:: 

&#8226; Commercial - approximately 23,000 accommodations requests with an aggregate carrying value totaling $25.1 billion. 

&#8226; Consumer - approximately 463,000 accommodations requests with an aggregate carrying value totaling $12.6 billion. 

&#8226; Credit card - approximately 37,000 accommodations requests with an aggregate carrying value totaling $0.2 billion. 

A significant portion of the borrowers that were provided payment relief were current as of the date that the relief was initially provided. 

The CARES Act also created the Paycheck Protection Program, which temporarily expands the Small Business Administration&#8217;s business loan guarantee program. Truist has obtained SBA authorizations for clients of approximately $12.6 billion, of which $9.1 billion was funded through the end of April. 

The following table provides a summary of exposure to industries that management believes are most vulnerable in the current environment. These selected industry exposures represent 8.9% of loans held for investment at March 31, 2020. Truist is actively managing these portfolios and will continue to make underwriting or risk acceptance adjustments as appropriate. In addition, management is closely monitoring its leveraged lending portfolio which comprised 3.3% of loans held for investment at March 31, 2020. Certain leveraged lending loans would also be included in the selected industry credit exposures.

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.2 billion at March 31, 2020, up $493 million compared to December 31, 2019 due almost entirely to the adoption of CECL, which resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for PCI loans and replaced that with a loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $500 million of PCI loans that would have been classified as nonperforming had we evaluated accrual status on a loan level basis. Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment represented 0.32% of loans and leases held for investment, up 17 basis points compared to December 31, 2019, but down three basis points from March 31, 2019. Performing TDRs were up $99 million during the first quarter, primarily in residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans and indirect automobile loans. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $1.7 billion at March 31, 2020, down $246 million compared to the prior quarter. The decline was due to loans that transitioned into nonaccrual status as a result of the change in pool level accounting described above, partially offset by an increase in government guaranteed student loans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.55% at March 31, 2020, down 11 basis points from the prior quarter. Excluding government guaranteed and PCI loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.04% at March 31, 2020, up one basis point from 0.03% at December 31, 2019. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.4 billion at March 31, 2020, up $161 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was largely in commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a decrease in student loans. The ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.74% at March 31, 2020, unchanged from the prior quarter. 

Problem loans include NPLs and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in Table 9. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to "Note 5. Loans and ACL" for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.

(2) This asset quality ratio has been adjusted to remove the impact of government guaranteed mortgage and student loans and PCI, as applicable. Management believes the inclusion of such assets in this asset quality ratio results in distortion of this ratio such that it might not be reflective of asset collectability or might not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that do not have government guarantees or were not impacted by PCI accounting requirements.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. As a result, Truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. In accordance with the CARES Act, Truist implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. These loan modifications are not considered TDRs to the extent that the borrower was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and was less than 30 days past due at December 31, 2019, or in certain circumstances, at the time that the COVID-19 loan modification program was implemented, unless the loan was previously classified as a TDR. 

TDRs identified by SunTrust prior to the Merger date are not included in Truist's TDR disclosure because all such loans were recorded at fair value and a new accounting basis was established as of the Merger date. Subsequent modifications will be evaluated for potential treatment as TDRs in accordance with Truist's accounting policies.

The ACL consists of the ALLL, which is presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the RUFC, which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ACL totaled $5.6 billion at March 31, 2020, up $3.7 billion compared to the prior quarter. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due the adoption of CECL. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $3.1 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses, including $2.8 billion that was charged to retained earnings before tax, and $378 million related to the gross up for PCD loans. The remaining increase in the allowance for credit losses primarily reflects deteriorated economic conditions as well as significant loan growth from clients drawing down their lines of credit to build liquidity in response to COVID-19. The allowance for credit losses includes $5.2 billion for loans and leases and $400 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. As of March 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.63% of loans and leases held for investment. 

The allowance for loan and lease losses was 5.04 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 3.41 times at December 31, 2019. At March 31, 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 4.76 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 2.03 times at December 31, 2019. 

58 Truist Financial Corporation 

Net charge-offs during the first quarter totaled $272 million, up $80 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was largely due to the impact of a full quarter from the Merger. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.36%, down four basis points compared to the prior quarter. 

The following table presents an allocation of the ALLL. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

&#160; 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. As a result, using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends, Truist estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the ALLL to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits. Finally, Truist also provides additional reserves for second lien positions when the estimated combined current loan to value ratio for the credit exceeds 100%. As of March 31, 2020, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 30.9% of its second lien positions.

Borrowings 

At March 31, 2020, short-term borrowings totaled $12.7 billion, a decrease of $5.5 billion compared to December 31, 2019, due largely to a decrease of $4.7 billion in short-term FHLB advances. Average short-term borrowings were $18.9 billion, or 4.7% of total funding for the first quarter 2020, as compared to $5.6 billion, or 3.0% for the prior year quarter. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $65.7 billion at March 31, 2020, an increase of $24.3 billion compared to December 31, 2019, as management took actions to increase liquidity to meet potential funding needs. These actions included an increase of $20.0 billion in long-term FHLB advances, and issuances of $2.5 billion of senior notes with interest rates from 1.25% to 1.50% maturing in 2023 to 2025, $500 million in floating rate senior notes maturing in 2023 and $1.3 billion of subordinated notes with an interest rate of 2.25% maturing in 2030. These increases were partially offset by the redemption of $750 million of senior notes during the first quarter of 2020. The average cost of long-term debt was 2.34% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, down 96 basis points compared to the same period in 2019. FHLB advances represented 36.8% of total outstanding long-term debt at March 31, 2020, compared to 10.0% at December 31, 2019. 

During the second quarter of 2020, Truist announced the redemption of $750 million of fixed rate and $300 million of floating rate medium term notes with a maturity date in June 2020. 

Shareholders' Equity 

Total shareholders' equity was $66.1 billion at March 31, 2020, a decrease of $497 million from December 31, 2019. The decrease in shareholders&#8217; equity includes $2.1 billion related to the adoption of CECL and $679 million for common and preferred dividends, which was partially offset by $1.1 billion in net income available to common shareholders and an increase of $1.7 billion in AOCI. In addition, Truist redeemed $500 million of its Series K preferred stock during the first quarter of 2020. Truist's book value per common share at March 31, 2020 was $45.49, compared to $45.66 at December 31, 2019. 

Risk Management 

Truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves appropriately managing risk to optimize risk and return, and operate in a safe and sound manner while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework is designed to ensure that business strategies and objectives are executed in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports transparency and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Compensation decisions take into account a teammate's adherence to, and successful implementation of, Truist's risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company's compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage BB&#38;T and heritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive Leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities. 

Refer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional disclosures under the section titled "Risk Management."

Market risk management 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices. 

Truist Financial Corporation 61 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist's strategic financial objectives. Truist's most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk and volatility risk in Truist's BUs. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk). 

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

Interest rate market risk (other than trading) 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities. Since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution, Truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities and mix, with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible. Truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates. 

The Company&#8217;s simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. These assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to Truist&#8217;s assets and liabilities. The model also considers Truist's current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes and projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance. 

Deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. Truist applies an average deposit beta (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) of approximately 55% to its non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. Truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact they could have on the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position. The predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk. 

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below. 

Table 19: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis Interest Rate Scenario Annualized Hypothetical Percentage Change in Net Interest Income Linear Change in Prime Rate (bps) Prime Rate Mar 31, 2020 Mar 31, 2019 Mar 31, 2020 Mar 31, 2019 Up 100 4.25 % 6.50 % 2.56 % 1.04 % Up 50 3.75 &#160; 6.00 &#160; 2.00 &#160; 0.64 &#160; No Change 3.25 &#160; 5.50 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Down 25 3.00 &#160; 5.25 &#160; (2.11) &#160; N/A &#160; Down 50 (1) 2.75 &#160; 5.00 &#160; (3.86) &#160; (1.58) &#160; 

(1) The Down 50 rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect Down 50 basis points for all rate indices. 

Rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods, primarily driven by loan and deposit mix changes related to the Merger and recent activity, increased fixed rate funding, and increased noninterest-bearing deposits 

Truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the Board. The following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered Truist's primary measures of interest rate risk: 

&#8226; Maximum impact on net interest income of 7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters; and a 

&#8226; Maximum impact on net interest income of 10% for an immediate 100 basis point parallel change in rates.

This interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk. 

Truist also uses an EVE analysis to focus on longer-term projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates. This measure allows Truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period. The EVE model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments. The difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as EVE. 

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on EVE:

Truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt and other funding sources. Truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. As of March 31, 2020, Truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $326.0 billion, with an associated net fair value of $3.3 billion. See "Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments" for additional disclosures. 

LIBOR in its current form may no longer be available after 2021. Truist has LIBOR-based contracts that extend beyond 2021. To prepare for the possible transition to an alternative reference rate, management has formed a cross-functional project team to address the LIBOR transition. The project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR to a new index. The project provides regular reports to the Board. 

The project team is reviewing contract fallback language for loans and leases and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition, and the team is coordinating with impacted lines of business to update LIBOR fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC recommendation. Truist is continuing to evaluate the impact on these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and other related operational and market risks. Market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition. For a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of LIBOR and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Market risk from trading activities 

Truist also manages market risk associated with trading activities. As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both trading desks and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with Truist's risk appetite. 

Truist is subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule, issued jointly by the OCC, U.S. Treasury, FRB and FDIC. 

Covered trading positions 

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements, or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for our clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies exist for all covered positions. Additionally, trading positions are subject to independent price verification. See "Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; "Note 14. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies, procedures and methodologies.

Securitizations 

As of March 31, 2020, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule was $4 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation trading positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of March 31, 2020. 

VaR-based measures 

VaR measures the estimated potential loss at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. Following the Merger, Truist elected to migrate all covered positions to the heritage SunTrust VaR system and methodology. For an interim period, however, VaR for a subset of heritage BB&#38;T positions, specifically those covered positions held in BB&#38;T Securities, will be calculated using the heritage BB&#38;T VaR system and methodology. As such, pending full integration, Truist will operate two historical VaR models and aggregate company-wide VaR will be determined additively with no benefit of diversification. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits. 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios. As such, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories thereby creating portfolio diversification benefit. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. The increase from the prior year was mainly due to the integration of the heritage SunTrust trading business and the market volatility due to COVID-19 pandemic in March.

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for our trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures:

Table 22: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Three Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Maximum $ 65 &#160; $ 6 &#160; Average 33 &#160; 5 &#160; Minimum 16 &#160; 4 &#160; Period-end 19 &#160; 6 &#160; 

The increase from the prior year in stressed VaR-based measures was due to the integration of heritage SunTrust trading business after the Merger. 

Specific risk measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital and comprehensive risk measure capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR model backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. 

There were seven company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic which led to a sudden and significant repricing of financial markets, amid an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity. In accordance with established policy and procedure, all company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. Following such reviews, it was determined that the VaR model performed in line with expectations. However, the extreme moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1-day VaR measure.

Model risk management 

MRM is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRM policy and standards, which includes regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress testing 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company's comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist's funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position, and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Truist's liquid asset buffer, as a percent of total assets, was 19.6% and 16.5%, respectively. 

The LCR rule directs large U.S. banking organizations to hold unencumbered high-quality liquid assets sufficient to withstand projected 30-day total net cash outflows, each as defined under the LCR rule. As of January 1, 2020, Truist is subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements (85% of the full requirements). Truist's average LCR was 117% for the three months ended March 31, 2020, well above the regulatory minimum. 

The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the Parent Company's and Truist Bank's credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings. Management meets with the rating agencies on a regular basis to discuss current outlooks. In April 2020, DBRS revised its outlook for Truist and Truist Bank from &#8220;positive&#8221; to &#8220;stable,&#8221; citing economic deterioration related to COVID-19. DBRS affirmed all other ratings for Truist and Truist Bank. Additionally, Fitch revised its outlook for Truist and Truist Bank from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative,&#8221; also citing pandemic-related economic deterioration. Fitch downgraded Truist&#8217;s subordinated debt to A-, and upgraded Truist&#8217;s preferred stock to BBB, in order to align these ratings to its recently revised bank rating methodology. Fitch affirmed all other Truist ratings. See "Liquidity" section of the MD&#38;A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for 

additional information regarding credit ratings. 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company's assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and accounts receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, retirement of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. 

See "Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for 

additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions. 

66 Truist Financial Corporation 

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Parent Company had 26 months and 29 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 17 months and 20 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Truist Bank 

Truist carefully manages liquidity risk at Truist Bank. Truist Bank's primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. At March 31, 2020, Truist Bank has approximately $137.8 billion of available secured borrowing capacity, which represents approximately 3.5 times the amount of one year wholesale funding maturities. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Refer to Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for discussion with respect to Truist's quantitative and qualitative disclosures about its fixed and determinable contractual obligations. Truist's commitments include investments in affordable housing projects throughout its market area, renewable energy credits, private equity funds, derivative contracts to manage various financial risks, as well as other commitments. Refer to "Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; &#8220;Note 14. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; and &#8220;Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; in this Form 10-Q, and &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these commitments. 

Capital 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist's principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist's risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. 

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company's capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management's overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory "well capitalized" minimums. Management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist's capital plan.

Truist Financial Corporation 67 

During the first quarter of 2020, as market conditions evolved, Truist received Board approval to establish new interim operating targets that provide for sufficient capital levels while allowing the company to support clients through the economic downturn. These interim operating targets will be evaluated as economic conditions evolve. 

While nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the Company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios, it is management's intent to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time through capital planning. Such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of Truist's overall capital policy, provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period. 

Truist's capital ratios are presented in the following table: 

Table 24: Capital Ratios - Truist Financial Corporation (Dollars in millions, except per share data, shares in thousands) Mar 31, 2020 Dec 31, 2019 Risk-based: (preliminary) &#160; CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets 9.3 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 10.5 &#160; 10.8 &#160; Total capital to risk-weighted assets 12.6 &#160; 12.6 &#160; Leverage ratio 9.0 &#160; 14.7 &#160; Supplementary leverage ratio 7.8 &#160; NA Non-GAAP capital measure (1): &#160; &#160; Tangible common equity per common share $ 26.00 &#160; $ 25.93 &#160; Calculation of tangible common equity (1): &#160; &#160; Total shareholders' equity $ 66,061 &#160; $ 66,558 &#160; Less: &#160; &#160; Preferred stock 4,599 &#160; 5,102 &#160; Noncontrolling interests 167 &#160; 174 &#160; Goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred taxes 26,263 &#160; 26,482 &#160; Tangible common equity $ 35,032 &#160; $ 34,800 &#160; Risk-weighted assets $ 391,387 &#160; $ 376,056 &#160; Common shares outstanding at end of period 1,347,461 &#160; 1,342,166 &#160; 

(1) Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk and believes investors may find them useful in their analysis of the Corporation. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies. 

Capital ratios declined slightly primarily due to the significant balance sheet growth related to commercial clients drawing on lines of credit in response to COVID-19. The leverage and supplementary leverage ratios were also impacted by higher balances held at the Federal Reserve. As noted previously, the FRB issued an interim rule that is effective beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and ending March 31, 2021 that will remove U.S. treasuries and FRB balances from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio for BHCs. In March 2020, the company redeemed $500 million of Series K preferred stock and issued $1.3 billion of subordinated debt. Truist's capital levels remain strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks at March 31, 2020. Truist declared common dividends of $0.450 per share during the first quarter of 2020. The dividend and total payout ratios for the first quarter of 2020 were 61.4%. As previously communicated at the time of the Merger announcement, Truist suspended its share repurchase program until capital ratios return to higher levels.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Truist's financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. The more critical policies include accounting for the ACL, determining fair value of financial instruments, intangible assets, income taxes and costs and benefit obligations associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans. Understanding Truist's accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&#38;A in Truist's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additional disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in the &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; included herein. Except for the items noted below, there have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during 2020. 

Intangible Assets 

The severe economic disruption and related financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted Truist&#8217;s businesses. Truist&#8217;s commercial clients have experienced varying levels of disruptions to business activity, supply chains and demand for products and services. Additionally, many consumer clients have experienced interrupted income or unemployment. The pandemic also resulted in significant volatility to the global and U.S. financial markets, negatively impacting equity prices and corporate credit spreads, including for the banking sector and Truist. In response to the pandemic&#8217;s adverse effects, intensive relief actions by the U.S. Congress and regulatory agencies are intended to mitigate the extent of adverse economic effects, while also stabilizing financial markets and liquidity. 

As a result of these considerations, Truist performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill carried by the CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB and IH reporting units for impairment in the first quarter of 2020. In performing this assessment, Truist considered whether macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, a sensitivity analysis on management&#8217;s forecast and assumptions, and Truist specific performance indicators, including any changes from when the merger closed in December 2019, would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of one or more of its reporting units below its respective carrying amount as of period-end. Despite the adverse economic and highly uncertain environment caused by the pandemic, Trust&#8217;s first quarter 2020 results reflected profitable performance across each of its reporting units; strong capital and liquidity levels that have facilitated swift actions in support of clients, teammates and communities and Truist&#8217;s affirmation that it remains committed to achieving its merger value proposition, including targeted net cost saves. 

Based on the qualitative assessment performed, Truist concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of March 31, 2020, and therefore no triggering event occurred that required a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If economic conditions deteriorate, or the pandemic&#8217;s effects prolong or worsen, it may be more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of Truist&#8217;s reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount, which would require a quantitative goodwill impairment test.

ACL 

Truist's policy is to maintain an ACL, which includes the ALLL and the RUFC, which represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management&#8217;s judgement. The models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic variables to historical experience. The models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. Beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to an historical average over a one year period. Expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a TDR. 

A qualitative allowance which incorporates management&#8217;s judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses. This allowance is used to capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain. These events may include, but are not limited to, political conditions, legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which Truist conducts business. 

Loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateral-dependent are individually evaluated. For these loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any. For TDRs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. 

The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is inherently similar to that used to determine the funded component of the ALLL and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ACL is included in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation."
