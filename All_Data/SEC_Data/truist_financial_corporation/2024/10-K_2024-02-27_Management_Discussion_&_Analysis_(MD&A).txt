 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

MD&#38;A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and other information contained in this document. For discussion of 2022 results as compared to 2021 results, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. A description of certain factors that may affect our future results and risk factors is set forth in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors of this report. 

Executive Overview 

Underlying results were positive for 2023 despite economic uncertainty stemming from bank failures in the first half of 2023. Truist withstood the market stress by leaning on its strong core deposit base, ample liquidity, and diverse revenue streams across multiple businesses. Results for 2023 included several discrete items, including a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that has no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, liquidity, ability to pay the common dividend, or service our clients. 

We grew the number of new consumer and business checking accounts, experienced another strong year of growth in our insurance business, gained share in capital markets, and deepened our relationships with clients through Integrated Relationship Management, Business Lifecycle Advisory, and digital channels. 

We also committed nearly $2.1 billion to support more than 15,000 units of affordable housing through Truist Community Capital, which helped create more than 15,000 jobs, and serve more than 130,000 people in low- and moderate-income communities in 2023. Teammates impacted 5,300 organizations and causes through their charitable giving and more than 62,000 hours of volunteer service. In addition, we started a Small Business Community Heroes initiative which empowers our branch teammates to proactively connect via caring conversations with small business owners who work tirelessly to serve our neighbors, create jobs, build our communities, and help drive our economy. 

In addition, we unveiled an organizational simplification and cost savings plan in September 2023 aimed at limiting expenses in 2024 and beyond and simplifying our organization to gain efficiencies that will improve the client experience. Our transformation is centered on improving efficiency as an organization and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our operating segments to increase efficiency and drive revenue opportunities. We made strong progress on our plan in the second half of 2023 as evidenced by a reduction in our headcount and the consolidation of several key business lines. 

We accomplished all of this in 2023, while also strengthening our balance sheet. We added 110 basis points of CET1 to finish the year with a CET1 ratio of 10.1% through a combination of organic capital generation and the minority stake sale in our insurance business, partially offset by the CECL phase in. Although we are committed to building capital, our balance sheet remains open to core clients as our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing clients and the payment of our common dividend. Asset quality continues to normalize, but remains in-line relative to our expectations and allowance coverage ratios. 

On October 2, 2023, Truist announced changes to its Board of Directors. On December 31, 2023, directors Kelly S. King, Nido R. Qubein, David M. Ratcliffe and Thomas N. Thompson retired due to these directors reaching Truist&#8217;s mandatory retirement age. In addition, Board members Anna R. Cablik, Paul D. Donahue, Easter A. Maynard and Frank P. Scruggs, Jr. decided to conclude their service as directors effective as of December 31, 2023. The Board and Truist&#8217;s management express their deep appreciation to these directors for their dedicated service and many significant contributions to Truist. 

Effective January 2024, several business activities were realigned within the segments. First, the CB&#38;W segment was renamed Consumer and Small Business Banking and the C&#38;CB segment was renamed Wholesale Banking. Second, the Wealth business was repositioned into a component of the Wholesale Banking segment from the CB&#38;W segment. Third, certain small business banking functions were repositioned into a component of the Consumer and Small Business Banking segment from the C&#38;CB segment.

On February 20, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the remaining 80% stake of the common equity in TIH to an investor group led by Stone Point Capital LLC for a purchase price that implies an enterprise value for TIH of $15.5 billion, and is expected to result in cash proceeds to Truist of approximately $10.1 billion after-tax, reflecting certain closing adjustments for cash, debt and debt-like items, including the settlement of certain previously granted TIH awards, working capital, transaction expenses and an investor return amount associated with the originally sold 20% stake. The transaction improves Truist&#8217;s relative capital position and allows Truist to maintain strategic flexibility. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon closing, the transaction will result in a full deconsolidation of the TIH subsidiary from Truist, and an expected gain equal to the excess of after-tax cash proceeds over Truist&#8217;s approximate $5.4 billion investment in its TIH subsidiary. 

Key Areas of Focus 

Truist&#8217;s business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the Company&#8217;s business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. During this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the Company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. Achieving key strategic objectives and long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. In the opinion of management, the following are the key areas of focus most likely to impact Truist&#8217;s near to medium term performance: 

&#8226; Completing our transformation into a simpler, more efficient, and client-centric organization with leading financial results; 

&#8226; Leveraging our existing platforms and increasing our efficiencies to gain market share; 

&#8226; Focusing on integrated relationship management to deepen relationships with core clients, improve client experiences, and deliver the bank as One Team; 

&#8226; Digitizing the enterprise through our &#8220;T3 strategy&#8221; to create a world-class client experience and streamline, simplify, and automate processes and operations; and 

&#8226; Building capital and maintaining strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. 

In addition, certain challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on Truist&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. See the sections titled &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional examples of such challenges.

Truist&#8217;s revenue for 2023 was $23.4 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was $23.6 billion, which represents an increase of $433 million compared to 2022. Net interest income on a TE basis was $14.8 billion, up $362 million, or 2.5%, primarily due to higher market interest rates and higher average loans. These increases were partially offset by higher funding costs and lower purchase accounting accretion. 

&#8226; Average earning assets increased $13.5 billion, or 2.8%, compared to the prior year primarily due to growth in average total loans of $15.5 billion, or 5.1%, and growth in other earning assets of $9.3 billion, or 46%, primarily due to an increase in balances held at the Federal Reserve to support liquidity build, partially offset by a $10.3 billion, or 7.0%, decrease in average securities. 

&#8226; Average deposits decreased $17.0 billion, or 4.1%, compared to the prior year while average short-term borrowings increased $9.5 billion, or 64%, and average long-term debt increased $15.5 billion, or 45%. 

Noninterest income was up $71 million, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher insurance income and lending related fees, partially offset by lower investment banking and trading income, service charges on deposits and other income. The prior year included $71 million of securities losses and a $74 million gain on the redemption of noncontrolling equity interest (other income). 

NIM was 3.00% for 2023, down one basis point compared to the prior year. NIM was negatively impacted by lower purchase accounting accretion, which benefited NIM by 5 basis points in 2023 compared to 13 basis points in 2022, partially offset by higher rates. 

&#8226; The yield on the average total loan portfolio was 6.12% for 2023, up 176 basis points, compared to the prior year primarily reflecting higher market interest rates, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.24% for 2023, up 36 basis points compared to the prior year. 

&#8226; The average cost of total deposits was 1.58% for 2023, up 131 basis points compared to the prior year. The average cost of short-term borrowings was 5.25% for 2023, up 267 basis points compared to the prior year. The average cost on long-term debt was 4.46% for 2023, up 215 basis points compared to the prior year. The increases in rates on deposits and other funding sources was largely attributable to the higher rate environment. 

The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $777 million in 2022. The net charge-off ratio for the current year of 0.50% was up 23 basis points compared to the prior year. 

&#8226; The increase in the current period provision expense primarily reflects an allowance build and higher net charge-offs. 

&#8226; The net charge-off ratio was up compared to the prior year driven by higher charge-offs in the commercial and industrial, CRE, indirect auto, other consumer, and credit card portfolios as well as the sale of the student loan portfolio. 

Noninterest expense was up $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due to goodwill impairment of $6.1 billion, higher regulatory costs primarily due to the FDIC special assessment of $507 million, higher other expense, and higher personnel expense, partially offset by lower merger-related and restructuring charges, professional fees and outside processing expenses, equipment expense, marketing and customer development expense, and amortization of intangibles. Merger-related and restructuring charges and incremental operating expenses related to the merger decreased $138 million and $465 million, respectively, due to the completion of integration-related activities. Merger-related and restructuring charges for the current year include increased severance charges due to the ongoing transformation efforts as well as the continuation of specific facilities optimization costs. The prior period also included a gain on the redemption of FHLB advances of $39 million (other expense). Adjusted noninterest expenses, which exclude goodwill impairment, the FDIC special assessment, merger-related costs, the amortization of intangibles, and gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, increased $908 million, or 6.9%. 

The provision for income taxes was $862 million for 2023, compared to $1.4 billion to 2022. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily driven by lower pre-tax earnings, which includes a non-deductible goodwill impairment, and a discrete tax benefit of $204 million. 

Truist&#8217;s total assets at December 31, 2023 were $535.3 billion, a decrease of $19.9 billion, or 3.6%, compared to December 31, 2022 as loans and leases, net of ALLL, decreased $14.4 billion, or 4.5%, total securities decreased $8.0 billion, or 6.2%, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, as well as the aforementioned goodwill impairment, partially offset by an increase of $9.5 billion, or 59.4%, in interest-bearing deposits with banks. 

Total liabilities at December 31, 2023 were $476.1 billion, a decrease of $18.6 billion, or 3.8%, from the prior year, reflecting a decrease of $17.6 billion, or 4.3%, in deposits and a decrease of $4.3 billion, or 9.9%, in long-term debt, partially offset by an increase of $1.4 billion, or 6.0%, in short-term borrowings.

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $59.3 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2022. This decrease includes $3.1 billion in common and preferred dividends and a $1.0 billion net loss, partially offset by $1.4 billion received in connection with the TIH minority stake sale, net of tax, and $1.1 billion in OCI. Truist&#8217;s book value per common share at December 31, 2023 was $39.31, compared to $40.58 at December 31, 2022. Truist&#8217;s TBVPS of $21.83 at December 31, 2023, increased 21% compared to December 31, 2022. 

Asset quality reflects normalization and modest deterioration in commercial portfolios. 

&#8226; Nonperforming loans and leases held for investment were 0.44% of loans and leases held for investment at December 31, 2023, up eight basis points compared to December 31, 2022.

Capital strengthened during 2023. 

&#8226; Truist&#8217;s CET1 ratio was 10.1% as of December 31, 2023. The 110 basis point increase since December 31, 2022 resulted from organic capital generation and the minority stake sale in TIH, partially offset by the CECL phase in.

Analysis of Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income and NIM 

Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was up $362 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2022 primarily due to higher market interest rates and higher average loans.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $777 million in 2022. The net charge-off ratio for the current year of 0.50% was up 23 basis points compared to the prior year. 

&#8226; The increase in the current period provision expense primarily reflects an allowance build and higher net charge-offs. 

&#8226; The net charge-off ratio was up compared to the prior year driven by higher charge-offs in the commercial and industrial, CRE, indirect auto, other consumer, and credit card portfolios as well as the sale of the student loan portfolio. 

Refer to &#8220;Note 5. Loans and ACL&#8221; for additional discussion of the ACL. 

Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist&#8217;s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist&#8217;s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates. The following table provides a breakdown of Truist&#8217;s noninterest income: ##TABLE_START Table 10: Noninterest Income Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021 Insurance income $ 3,354 $ 3,043 $ 2,627 10.2 % 15.8 % Wealth management income 1,358 1,338 1,392 1.5 (3.9) Investment banking and trading income 822 995 1,441 (17.4) (31.0) Card and payment related fees 936 944 874 (0.8) 8.0 Service charges on deposits 869 1,026 1,060 (15.3) (3.2) Mortgage banking income 437 460 734 (5.0) (37.3) Lending related fees 447 375 349 19.2 7.4 Operating lease income 254 258 262 (1.6) (1.5) Securities gains (losses) &#8212; (71) &#8212; NM NM Other income 313 351 551 (10.8) (36.3) Total noninterest income $ 8,790 $ 8,719 $ 9,290 0.8 (6.1) ##TABLE_END

Noninterest income was up $71 million, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher insurance income and lending related fees, partially offset by lower investment banking and trading income, service charges on deposits and other income. The prior year included $71 million of securities losses and a $74 million gain on the redemption of noncontrolling equity interest (other income). 

&#8226; Insurance income increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions. 

&#8226; Lending related fees increased due to higher leasing-related gains. 

&#8226; Investment banking and trading income decreased due to lower structured real estate income, partially offset by higher merger and acquisition fees as well as higher bond and equity originations. 

&#8226; Service charges on deposits decreased primarily due to changes in service fee protocols, as well as reduced overdraft fees as a result of continued growth of Truist One Banking. 

&#8226; Other income decreased primarily due to higher derivative collateral related costs and the aforementioned gain on the redemption of noncontrolling equity in the prior period, partially offset by higher income from investments held for certain post-retirement benefits (which is primarily offset by higher personnel expense).

Noninterest Expense 

The following table provides a breakdown of Truist&#8217;s noninterest expense: ##TABLE_START Table 11: Noninterest Expense Year Ended December 31, % Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs. 2022 2022 vs. 2021 Personnel expense $ 8,654 $ 8,467 $ 8,632 2.2 % (1.9) % Professional fees and outside processing 1,341 1,411 1,442 (5.0) (2.1) Software expense 929 932 945 (0.3) (1.4) Net occupancy expense 715 744 764 (3.9) (2.6) Amortization of intangibles 527 583 574 (9.6) 1.6 Equipment expense 409 478 513 (14.4) (6.8) Marketing and customer development 297 352 294 (15.6) 19.7 Operating lease depreciation 175 184 190 (4.9) (3.2) Regulatory costs 824 183 137 NM 33.6 Merger-related and restructuring charges 375 513 822 (26.9) (37.6) Goodwill impairment 6,078 &#8212; &#8212; NM NM Other expense 1,142 742 803 53.9 (7.6) Total noninterest expense $ 21,466 $ 14,589 $ 15,116 47.1 (3.5) ##TABLE_END

Noninterest expense was up $6.9 billion, or 47.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 due to goodwill impairment of $6.1 billion, higher regulatory costs primarily due to the FDIC special assessment of $507 million, higher other expense, and higher personnel expense, partially offset by lower merger-related and restructuring charges, professional fees and outside processing expenses, equipment expense, marketing and customer development expense, and amortization of intangibles. Merger-related and restructuring charges and incremental operating expenses related to the Merger decreased $138 million and $465 million, respectively, due to the completion of integration-related activities in 2022. Merger-related and restructuring charges for the current year include increased severance charges due to the ongoing transformation efforts as well as the continuation of specific facilities optimization costs. The prior period also included a gain on the redemption of FHLB advances of $39 million (other expense). 

Adjusted noninterest expenses, which exclude goodwill impairment, the FDIC special assessment, merger-related costs, the amortization of intangibles, and gains and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, increased $908 million, or 6.9%. 

&#8226; Other expense, excluding the aforementioned gain on FHLB advances, increased primarily due to higher pension expense (driven primarily by lower plan assets) and higher operating losses, including $70 million of costs associated with changes in service fee protocols as well as settlement of certain litigation matters, including a settlement and patent licensing agreement that resolved the USAA remote deposit capture patent infringement lawsuit. 

&#8226; Personnel expense increased due to investments in teammates by increasing Truist&#8217;s minimum wage, the impact from acquisitions, and investments in revenue producing businesses and enterprise technology, and higher other post-retirement benefit expense (which is almost entirely offset by higher other income), partially offset by lower pension expenses and lower incentives as well as reduced headcount in the second half of 2023, in part due to our ongoing transformation into a more efficient organization. 

&#8226; Regulatory costs, excluding the aforementioned FDIC special assessment, increased primarily due to an increase in the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment rate. 

&#8226; Professional fees and outside processing expense decreased due to prior period incremental operating expenses related to the Merger, partially offset by higher enterprise technology and other investments. 

&#8226; Equipment expense decreased due to retirement of certain technology related equipment and higher laptop purchases in 2022. 

&#8226; Marketing and customer development expenses decreased due to reduced marketing compared to the prior year. 

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges 

Truist has incurred certain merger-related and restructuring charges, which include: 

&#8226; severance and personnel-related costs or credits; 

&#8226; occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment; 

&#8226; professional services, which relate to legal and investment banking advisory fees and other consulting services pertaining to restructuring initiatives or transactions; 

&#8226; systems conversion and related charges, which represent costs to integrate the entity&#8217;s information technology systems; 

Truist Financial Corporation 51 

&#8226; costs for integration of mergers and acquisitions and other restructuring charges or credits, which include expenses necessary to convert and combine the acquired branches and operations of merged companies, direct media advertising related to the mergers and acquisitions, asset and supply inventory write-offs, and other similar charges; and 

&#8226; write-offs related to exiting certain businesses. 

Merger-related and restructuring accruals are established when the costs are incurred or once all requirements for a plan to dispose of or outsource certain business functions have been approved by management. Merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. The remaining accruals at December 31, 2023 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later. 

The following table presents a summary of merger-related and restructuring charges and the related accruals. The 2023 merger-related and restructuring costs predominately reflect various restructuring initiatives, including costs for severance and other benefits and costs related to exiting facilities. ##TABLE_START Table 12: Merger-Related and Restructuring Accrual Activity (Dollars in millions) Accrual at Jan 1, 2022 Expense Utilized Accrual at Dec 31, 2022 Expense Utilized Accrual at Dec 31, 2023 Severance and personnel-related $ 77 $ 92 $ (160) $ 9 $ 276 $ (265) $ 20 Occupancy and equipment &#8212; 175 (175) &#8212; 67 (67) &#8212; Professional services 37 142 (167) 12 10 (20) 2

Segment Results 

Through December 31, 2023, Truist operated and measured business activities across three segments: Consumer Banking and Wealth, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Insurance Holdings, with functional activities included in Other, Treasury, and Corporate. 

In 2023, Truist realigned Prime Rate Premium Finance Corporation, which includes AFCO Credit Corporation and CAFO Holding Company, into the C&#38;CB segment from the IH segment. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the current presentation. Additionally, Truist updated its segment cost allocation methodology. Results for 2023 have been revised to conform to the current presentation. Management concluded the impact to 2022 was not material. 

Effective January 2024, several business activities were realigned within the segments. First, the CB&#38;W segment was renamed Consumer and Small Business Banking and the C&#38;CB segment was renamed Wholesale Banking. Second, the Wealth business was repositioned into a component of the Wholesale Banking segment from the CB&#38;W segment. Third, certain small business banking functions were repositioned into a component of the Consumer and Small Business Banking segment from the C&#38;CB segment. The Company&#8217;s business segment structure is based on the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management as well as the products and services provided or the type of client served. 

The segment results are presented based on internal management methodologies that were designed to support these strategic objectives. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP. The application and development of management reporting methodologies is an active process and undergoes periodic enhancements. The implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the results disclosed for each segment, with no impact on consolidated results. When significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is revised. In conjunction with the Company&#8217;s April 3, 2023 sale of a 20% stake of the common equity in TIH, TIH issued $5 billion of 8.25% mandatorily redeemable preferred units to the Company, with the related interest expense, which is fully allocable to the Company, reported in Net intersegment interest income (expense). TIH is the principal legal entity of the IH segment. Also related to the same transaction, TIH was recapitalized from a corporate entity to an LLC, such that each member is allocated its share of TIH&#8217;s income before taxes, and beginning in the second quarter of 2023 the Company recognizes its associated income tax provision through OT&#38;C. The Company elected not to restate prior periods for this change based on TIH&#8217;s previous status as a corporate entity. The Company recognized $110 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 of tax provision related to IH in OT&#38;C. IH continues to recognize certain state jurisdictions that impose income taxes on partnerships and LLCs.

2023 compared to 2022 

Consumer Banking and Wealth 

CB&#38;W net income was $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.7 billion compared to the prior year. 

&#8226; Segment net interest income increased $614 million driven by favorable funding credit on deposits attributable to the higher rate environment and higher average loans, partially offset by higher funding costs, lower average deposits, and lower purchase accounting accretion. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses increased $226 million reflecting higher charge offs primarily in the indirect auto and other consumer portfolios, partially offset by a reserve release in the current period. 

&#8226; Noninterest income decreased $108 million primarily due to decreased service charge fees on deposits driven by changes in service fee protocols in the current period and a gain on the redemption of noncontrolling equity interest in the earlier period, partially offset by higher residential mortgage banking income in the current period. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased $4.1 billion primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge. Excluding goodwill impairment, noninterest expense increased $692 million due to higher corporate technology costs, the FDIC special assessment, and corporate operating and risk support expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and customer development, professional fees and outside processing, and amortization of intangibles. 

CB&#38;W average loans and leases held for investment increased $1.6 billion, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year driven primarily by an increase in residential mortgage and Service Finance loans, partially offset by the sale of the student loan portfolio in second quarter 2023 and a decrease in indirect auto loans. 

CB&#38;W average total deposits decreased $15.7 billion, or 6.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreases in average interest-bearing checking, money market and savings, and noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in time deposits. 

CB&#38;W had 2,001 banking offices at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 122 offices, or 5.7%, compared to December 31, 2022 due to continued branch network optimization. 

Truist Wealth had assets under management of $199 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $19 billion, or 10%, compared to the prior year primarily due to higher markets and positive net asset flows. 

Corporate and Commercial Banking 

C&#38;CB net income was $755 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.7 billion compared to the prior year. 

&#8226; Segment net interest income increased $617 million primarily due to higher funding credit on deposits and higher average loan balances, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion. 

&#8226; The provision for credit losses increased $1.1 billion which reflects an allowance build, higher charge offs, and loan growth in the current period as well as an allowance release in the earlier period. 

&#8226; Noninterest income decreased $324 million primarily due to lower structured real estate fee income, higher derivative collateral related costs, lower commercial mortgage income, and lower trading income, partially offset by increases in lending related fees, merger and acquisition fees, and bond originations. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased $3.2 billion primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge. Excluding goodwill impairment, noninterest expense increased $483 million driven by the FDIC special assessment, higher corporate technology expenses, and merger-related and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower corporate marketing expense and lower incentive expense.

C&#38;CB average loans and leases held for investment increased $15.1 billion, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year driven by an increase in the commercial and industrial portfolio. 

C&#38;CB average total deposits decreased $14.7 billion, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in money market and savings. 

Insurance Holdings 

IH net income was $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $224 million, or 44%, compared to the prior year. 

&#8226; Segment net interest income decreased $267 million driven primarily by interest expense accruals on new intercompany mandatorily redeemable preferred units resulting from the recapitalization of IH. 

&#8226; Noninterest income increased $306 million primarily due to continued organic growth and acquisitions. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense increased $389 million primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, investments in new hires and teammates, independence readiness expenses, performance-driven incentive expense, and higher operational loss reserves. 

Other, Treasury, and Corporate 

OT&#38;C generated a net loss of $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $2.5 billion in the prior year. 

&#8226; Segment net interest income decreased $680 million due to higher funding credit on deposits to other segments and higher rates, partially offset by higher funds transfer charges to other segments for loans and higher earnings on cash balances and in the securities portfolio driven by the higher rate environment. 

&#8226; Noninterest income increased $197 million primarily due to valuation changes from assets held for certain post-retirement benefits in the current period, which is primarily offset by higher personnel expense, and losses on the sale of securities in the earlier period. 

&#8226; Noninterest expense decreased $765 million primarily due to a decrease in incremental operating expenses related to the Merger and credit from other segments for corporate technology project support, partially offset by an increase in operating charge-offs due to costs associated with changes in deposit service fee protocols as well as settlement of certain litigation matters, including a settlement and patent licensing agreement that resolved the USAA remote deposit capture patent infringement lawsuit, and a gain on the redemption of FHLB advances in the prior year.

Analysis of Financial Condition 

Investment Activities 

Truist&#8217;s Board-approved investment policy is carried out by the MRLCC, which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLCC also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section in MD&#38;A. 

Investment strategies are reviewed by the MRLCC based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the Company. In general, the goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide sufficient liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn an optimal return on funds invested commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii) and consistent with the Company&#8217;s risk appetite. 

Truist Bank invests in securities allowable under bank regulations. These securities may include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, GSEs (including MBS), bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, non-agency MBS, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations (including corporate debentures), commercial paper, negotiable CDs, bankers&#8217; acceptances, mutual funds, and limited types of equity securities. ##TABLE_START Table 14: Composition of Securities Portfolio (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 AFS securities (at fair value): U.S. Treasury $ 10,041 $ 10,295 GSE 362 303 Agency MBS - residential 51,289 55,225 Agency MBS - commercial 2,248 2,424 States and political subdivisions 425 416 Non-agency MBS 2,981 3,117 Other 20 21 Total AFS securities 67,366 71,801 HTM securities (at amortized cost): &#160; &#160; Agency MBS - residential 54,107 57,713 Total securities $ 121,473 $ 129,514 ##TABLE_END

The securities portfolio totaled $121.5 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $129.5 billion at December 31, 2022. U.S. Treasury, GSE, and Agency MBS represents 97% of the total securities portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. While the overwhelming majority of the portfolio remains in agency MBS securities, the Company also holds AAA rated non-agency MBS as the risk adjusted returns for these securities are more attractive than agency MBS. 

&#8226; The decrease in 2023 includes paydowns and maturities of $13.9 billion, partially offset by $4.2 billion in purchases as well as an increase in the fair value of AFS securities. 

&#8226; As of December 31, 2023, 41% of the investment securities portfolio was classified as held-to-maturity based on amortized cost. 

&#8226; As of December 31, 2023, approximately 5.7% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, excluding the impact of swaps, compared to 5.6% as of December 31, 2022. 

&#8226; The effective duration of the AFS securities portfolio was 6.1 years at December 31, 2023 and 6.2 years at December 31, 2022, excluding the impact of swaps, or 4.0 years at December 31, 2023 and 6.0 years at December 31, 2022, including the impact of swaps. The effective duration of the HTM securities portfolio was 7.3 years at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(1) Yields represent interest computed under the effective interest method on a TE basis using the federal income tax rate and the amortized cost of the securities. 

(2) For purposes of the maturity table, MBS, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life of MBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans.

Lending Activities 

Truist strives to meet the credit needs of its clients while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality. Management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong client relationships over time and developing in-depth local market knowledge. The Company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of risk assumed and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry, and geographical concentration. 

Truist lends to a diverse client base that is geographically dispersed to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. The following discussion provides additional information on the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios. Refer to the &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; section for a discussion of the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio 

Commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking and small business banking generally target small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while CIB provides lending solutions to large corporate clients. The commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing, commercial real estate, government and institutional financing, premium financing, and dealer floor plan financing. 

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. Commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate or SOFR and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. The majority of Truist&#8217;s commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories, and other types of collateral. 

Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio 

Truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans, loans under FHA, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for 1-4 family residential properties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by FNMA and FHLMC. They are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing. 

Risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective MSR hedging process. Credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. The right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. Management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing diversifies income while enabling Truist to build long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. Truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third-party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally. 

Home Equity Loan Portfolio 

The home equity portfolio is composed of loans offered through Truist&#8217;s branch network. These include home equity loans and revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate in Truist&#8217;s market areas. 

Indirect Auto Loan Portfolio 

The indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. Such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the Truist market area and nationally through Regional Acceptance Corporation. These loans are homogeneous, and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the Company&#8217;s risk philosophy. In addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, Truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio. 

Truist Financial Corporation 57 

Other Consumer Loan Portfolio 

The other consumer portfolio includes loans originated through the Truist branch network, as well as loans originated by Truist&#8217;s national online consumer lending division. Loans originated through the Truist branch network include secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in Truist&#8217;s market areas. Truist provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system. The other consumer portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. The other consumer portfolio includes Sheffield, a small ticket consumer lending division related to the purchase of power sports and outdoor power equipment, and trailers. These loans are homogeneous, and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. These loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. The other consumer loan portfolio also includes other indirect and point-of-sale lending to consumers, including through Service Finance, to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, certain elective health-care services, and other consumer products segments. These loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by Truist. 

Student Loan Portfolio 

The student loan portfolio, which was sold in 2023, was primarily composed of government guaranteed student loans and additionally included certain private student loans originated by third parties. The government guarantee mitigated substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. 

Credit Card Loan Portfolio 

The credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. Truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. Such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed. 

Refer to &#8220;Note 5. Loans and ACL&#8221; for additional information. 

The following table summarizes the loan portfolio: ##TABLE_START Table 16: Loans and Leases as of Period End (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Commercial: Commercial and industrial $ 160,788 $ 164,307 CRE 22,570 22,676 Commercial construction 6,683 5,849 Consumer: Residential mortgage 55,492 56,645 Home equity 10,053 10,876 Indirect auto 22,727 27,951 Other consumer 28,647 27,533 Student &#8212; 5,287 Credit card 5,101 4,867 Total loans and leases HFI 312,061 325,991 LHFS 1,280 1,444 Total loans and leases $ 313,341 $ 327,435 ##TABLE_END

Loans and leases HFI were $312.1 billion at December 31, 2023, down $13.9 billion compared to 2022 primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2023 and balance sheet optimization. Excluding the student loan sale, loans HFI declined 2.7% compared to the prior year. 

Commercial loans decreased $2.8 billion during 2023 primarily due to a $3.5 billion decline in the commercial and industrial portfolio, partially offset by an $834 million increase in the commercial construction portfolio. 

Consumer loans and credit cards, excluding the student loan portfolio, decreased $5.9 billion during 2023 primarily due to a $5.2 billion decrease in indirect auto primarily due to lower production, a $1.2 billion decrease in residential mortgages due to lower correspondent channel production, and an $823 million decrease in home equity, partially offset by a $1.1 billion increase in other consumer primarily due to growth of higher-return point-of-sale lending portfolios (Service Finance and Sheffield).

The following table presents a summary of the loans and leases by scheduled repayment period and interest rate terms. Determinations of maturities are based on scheduled repayments, except when rollovers or extensions are included for purposes of measuring the ACL. Truist&#8217;s credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the client generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time. ##TABLE_START Table 17: Loan Maturities December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) 1 Year or Less 1 to 5 Years 5 to 15 Years After 15 Years Total Fixed rate: &#160; &#160; &#160; Commercial: Commercial and industrial $ 10,759 $ 15,635 $ 11,656 $ 2,395 $ 40,445 CRE 669 2,493 823 3 3,988 Commercial construction 38 58 27 16 139 Total commercial 11,466 18,186 12,506 2,414 44,572 Consumer: Residential mortgage 1,579 6,394 16,886 24,463 49,322 Home equity 339 1,033 1,756 469 3,597 Indirect auto 5,474 16,192 1,061 &#8212; 22,727 Other consumer 5,459 13,429 6,219 857 25,964 Total consumer 12,851 37,048 25,922 25,789 101,610 Credit card 282 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 282 Total fixed rate 24,599 55,234 38,428 28,203 146,464 Variable rate: &#160; &#160; &#160; Commercial: Commercial and industrial 30,579 77,740 9,855 2,169 120,343 CRE 4,216 12,479 1,877 10 18,582 Commercial construction 1,632 4,742 117 53 6,544 Total commercial 36,427 94,961 11,849 2,232 145,469 Consumer: Residential mortgage 173 754 2,206 3,037 6,170 Home equity 585 2,355 3,503 13 6,456 Other consumer 282 1,930 462 9 2,683 Total consumer 1,040 5,039 6,171 3,059 15,309 Credit card 4,819 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 4,819 Total variable rate 42,286 100,000 18,020 5,291 165,597 Total loans and leases HFI $ 66,885 $ 155,234 $ 56,448 $ 33,494 $ 312,061 ##TABLE_END

Certain residential mortgage loans have an initial period where the borrower is only required to pay the periodic interest. After the interest-only period, the loan will require the payment of both interest and principal over the remaining term. The outstanding balances of variable rate residential mortgage loans in the interest-only phase were approximately $317 million and $342 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2023, up $238 million compared to December 31, 2022 due to increases in the CRE and commercial and industrial portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio. Nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.44% of total loans and leases HFI, up 8 basis points compared to December 31, 2022. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $534 million at December 31, 2023, down $1.1 billion compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio and a decline in government guaranteed residential mortgages. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases HFI was 0.04% at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023, down $296 million compared to the prior year due to the sale of the student portfolio and a decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgages, partially offset by increases in the other consumer portfolio and guaranteed residential mortgages. The ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases HFI was 0.63% at December 31, 2023, down seven basis points compared to the prior year.

CRE and Commercial Construction 

Truist has noted that the CRE and commercial construction portfolios have the potential for heightened risk in the current environment. Truist maintains a high-quality portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. In addition, the Company&#8217;s exposure to large CRE tends to have more institutional sponsorship and the Company has reduced exposure to smaller CRE. Truist&#8217;s CRE and commercial construction portfolios totaled $29.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, which includes 33% related to multifamily residential, 17% related to office, 17% related to industrial, 14% related to retail, and the remainder composed of hotel and other commercial real estate. 

Our office and medical portfolios are primarily composed of Class A, multi-tenant properties located within Truist bank&#8217;s footprint. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 97% of these properties are multi-tenant or medical, and within our top 10 markets 64% and 25% of these exposures represent Class A and Class B properties, respectively. Approximately 26% and 25% of these exposures are scheduled to mature in 2024 and 2025, respectively, with the remainder scheduled to mature in 2026 and beyond. Truist maintains rigorous credit risk management surveillance routines across all loan portfolios. During 2023, Truist performed multiple reviews of the CRE office portfolio, which resulted in an increase in the ALLL for this portfolio.

(1) Excludes provision for credit losses and allowances related to other financial assets at amortized cost. 

(2) 2023 includes the impact from the adoption of the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures accounting standard. 

Net charge-offs during 2023 totaled $1.6 billion, or 0.50% as a percentage of average loans, and were up twenty-three basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher charge-offs in the commercial and industrial, CRE, indirect auto, other consumer, and credit card portfolios as well as the sale of the student loan portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses was $5.1 billion and includes $4.8 billion for the allowance for loan and lease losses and $295 million for the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL ratio was 1.54%, compared to 1.34% at December 31, 2022. The increase in the ALLL ratio primarily reflects an increase in reserves related to the CRE and commercial construction portfolios, loan growth in the other consumer portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the student portfolio. The ALLL covered nonperforming loans and leases held for investment 3.5x compared to 3.7x at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the ALLL was 3.0x annualized net charge-offs, compared to 5.3x at December 31, 2022.

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter. 

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. Truist estimates credit losses on second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of December 31, 2023, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 32% of its second lien positions.

Funding Activities 

Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company&#8217;s lending and investing activities. Scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. FHLB advances, other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. Funding activities are monitored and governed through Truist&#8217;s overall ALM process under the governance and oversight of the MRLCC, which is further discussed in the &#8220;Market Risk&#8221; section in MD&#38;A. The following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds. 

Deposits 

Deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within Truist&#8217;s geographic area and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, CDs, and IRAs. Deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost. 

The following table presents a summary of deposits: ##TABLE_START Table 27: Deposits as of Period End (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 111,624 $ 135,742 Interest checking 104,757 110,464 Money market and savings 135,923 143,815 Time deposits 43,561 23,474 Total deposits $ 395,865 $ 413,495 ##TABLE_END

Deposits totaled $395.9 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $17.6 billion from December 31, 2022. The decline in deposits reflects the impacts of monetary tightening, inflation, and higher interest rate alternatives, partially offset by growth in time deposits, which reflects increases in various wholesale deposit products to support funding. Brokered deposits were $31.3 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $22.4 billion at December 31, 2022. 

Truist has a very granular and relationship-based deposit franchise. Approximately 62% of deposits are insured or collateralized at December 31, 2023, compared to 61% at December 31, 2022. Truist deposit accounts are typically based on long-term relationships and include multiple products and services. The amount of deposits above the FDIC&#8217;s limit of $250,000 was $175.1 billion and $189.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, calculated using the same methodology as the Call Report for Truist Bank. The decrease in uninsured deposits from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was largely due to commercial clients that chose to diversify into money market mutual funds or across multiple banks (primarily higher-cost, non-operational deposits) and the maturity of large denominated negotiable certificates of deposit. 

The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposit accounts above $250,000: ##TABLE_START Table 28: Scheduled Maturities of Time Deposits $250,000 and Greater December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Three months or less $ 7,531 Over three through six months 1,225 Over six through twelve months 1,592 Over twelve months 74 Total $ 10,422 ##TABLE_END

66 Truist Financial Corporation 

Average deposits for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $395.3 billion, a decrease of $5.7 billion, or 1.4%, compared to the prior quarter. 

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.7% compared to the prior quarter and represented 29.0% of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 29.6% for the third quarter of 2023 and 34.1% compared to the year ago quarter. Average money market and savings accounts decreased 1.8%. Average time deposits increased 1.6% due to increases in retail client time deposits, primarily due to migration from other deposit products, partially offset by a $2.1 billion decline in brokered time deposits. 

Borrowings 

The types of short-term borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the Company include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, commercial paper, short-term bank notes, and short-term FHLB advances. Short-term borrowings fluctuate based on the Company&#8217;s funding needs. While deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. The following table summarizes certain information for the past three years with respect to short-term borrowings excluding trading liabilities, hedges, and collateral in excess of derivative exposure: ##TABLE_START Table 30: Short-Term Borrowings As Of / For The Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase: Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 4,120 $ 6,033 $ 3,279 Balance outstanding at end of year 2,427 2,128 2,435 Average outstanding during the year 2,472 2,670 2,382 Average interest rate during the year 5.18 % 1.33 % 0.07 % Average interest rate at end of year 5.39 4.36 0.01 Federal funds purchased and short-term borrowed funds: Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the year $ 26,453 $ 22,324 $ 6,244 Balance outstanding at end of year 22,401 19,340 808 Average outstanding during the year 22,007 10,135 1,936 Average interest rate during the year 5.26 % 2.79 % 0.12 % Average interest rate at end of year 5.15 4.38 0.08 ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2023, short-term borrowings totaled $24.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to December 31, 2022. Average short-term borrowings were $24.5 billion, or 5.2% of total funding, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $15.0 billion, or 3.2%, for the prior year. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $38.9 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $4.3 billion compared to December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had: 

&#8226; Maturities and redemptions of $5.5 billion of senior notes. 

&#8226; Issued $8.0 billion fixed-to-floating rate senior notes with interest rates between 4.87% and 7.161% due from June 8, 2027 to June 8, 2034. 

&#8226; Net redemptions of $6.6 billion of FHLB floating rate advances as issuances in the first quarter of 2023 were more than offset by redemptions throughout the rest of 2023.

(1) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist&#8217;s management uses this measure to assess balance sheet risk and shareholder value. 

Total shareholders&#8217; equity was $59.3 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2022. This decrease includes $3.1 billion in common and preferred dividends and a $1.0 billion net loss, partially offset by $1.4 billion received in connection with the TIH minority stake sale, net of tax, and $1.1 billion in OCI. Truist&#8217;s book value per common share at December 31, 2023 was $39.31, compared to $40.58 at December 31, 2022. Truist&#8217;s TBVPS of $21.83 at December 31, 2023, increased 21% compared to December 31, 2022. 

Risk Management 

Truist seeks to maintain a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner, and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s risk management framework is designed to promote the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite. 

Truist has developed and employs a risk framework that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. Truist has developed a risk taxonomy designed to drive internal risk measurement and monitoring and enable Truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the Company faces and the Company&#8217;s position on managing risk to acceptable levels. 

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company&#8217;s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance. 

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities must be evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital. 

Truist&#8217;s compensation plans are designed to consider teammate&#8217;s adherence to and successful implementation of Truist&#8217;s risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company&#8217;s compensation structure is designed to support its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior. 

Truist&#8217;s purpose, mission, and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at Truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. Truist&#8217;s RMO provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. In keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, Truist&#8217;s RMO has established the following risk values which are intended to guide teammates&#8217; day-to-day activities: 

&#8226; Managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate. 

&#8226; Proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units. 

&#8226; Managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth. 

&#8226; Utilizing sound and consistent risk management practices. 

68 Truist Financial Corporation 

&#8226; Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively. 

&#8226; Realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management. 

Truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate Board-level Risk Committee, which assists the Board in its oversight of the Company&#8217;s risk management function. The Committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the Company&#8217;s risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the Company&#8217;s risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding Truist&#8217;s risk appetite and risk profile. 

The RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management, and reporting of risk. The CRO has direct access to the Board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise. 

As illustrated below, the risk management framework is supported by three lines of defense. The following figure describes the roles of the three lines of defense: 

Truist&#8217;s Risk Governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive Board and management risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. The committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the business units up to the risk programs, management and ultimately the Board. The GCO standardizes first-line risk execution and ownership across the company in partnership with the business units and enterprise functions. As part of the first-line of defense, the GCO provides risk advice and effective challenge, issues management, testing, reporting, and business continuity expertise to first-line execution efforts. The GCO coordinates closely with the RMO to ensure proper program execution and regulatory compliance. 

Truist Financial Corporation 69 

Truist maintains a robust and comprehensive management committee structure reporting to the Truist Board of Directors, or Board committees thereof, that are responsible for providing independent risk oversight of each of Truist&#8217;s primary risk types and comprehensive coverage of Truist&#8217;s strategy, risk-taking and execution activities. Examples of such committees include the ERC and Management Compensation Oversight Committee. 

The ERC serves as the enterprise-wide risk governance body authorized by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors with responsibility for broad strategic oversight of all risk types and establishing a fully integrated view of risks across Truist at the enterprise level. The ERC is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. The ERC is chaired by the Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer and its membership includes the Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Audit Officer, and other designated members of Truist management. 

Principal types of inherent risk include market, credit, liquidity, technology, compliance, strategic, reputational, and operational risks. The following is a discussion of these risks. 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices. 

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist&#8217;s strategic financial objectives. Truist&#8217;s most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in Truist&#8217;s business units. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk). 

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function. 

Interest Rate Market Risk 

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. Truist primarily monitors this risk through two measurement types, (i) net interest income at risk and (ii) economic value of equity, and manages this risk with securities, derivatives, and broader asset liability management activities. 

70 Truist Financial Corporation 

Net interest income at risk measures changes in net interest income in alternate interest rate scenarios relative to Truist&#8217;s baseline scenario, which relies on assumptions including expectations of the economy and interest rates &#8211; which are influenced by market conditions, new business volume, pricing, and client behavior. In measuring net interest income at risk, Truist assumes that changes in key factors, such as prepayments and deposit pricing (betas), largely move in line with those it has experienced in prior rate cycles. However, future behavior of key factors used in this measurement may vary. Net interest income at risk measurement assumes, when applicable, that U.S. interest rates will not fall below zero. 

Truist evaluates a wide range of alternate scenarios including instantaneous and gradual as well as parallel and non-parallel changes in interest rates. The following table provides additional information on the estimated change to net interest income over the following 12 months for select parallel alternate scenarios, expressed as a percentage change relative to baseline net interest income. ##TABLE_START Table 32: Interest Sensitivity Simulation Analysis Dec 31, 2023 Up 200bps gradual change in interest rates (1.46) % Up 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates (0.36) 

Down 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates 

(0.10) 

Down 200bps gradual change in interest rates 

(0.30) ##TABLE_END

Estimated changes to net interest income in the previous table assume no change in deposit balances or mix relative to the baseline scenario. In an increasing rate scenario, rotation from non-interest-bearing into interest bearing deposits would reduce net interest income. Conversely, in a down rate scenario, rotation from higher yielding to lower yielding deposits would benefit net interest income. Truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of deposit and other key assumptions used in interest rate risk. 

Economic value of equity measures changes in economic value of Truist&#8217;s current balance sheet and off-balance sheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios relative to starting economic value. Truist uses economic value of equity as a longer-term measure of interest rate risk. 

LIBOR Transition 

The remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR ceased publication of representative rates on June 30, 2023, with only select tenors receiving a synthetic publication through September 30, 2024. Truist provided timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition to new interest rates post cessation and had minimal use of synthetic LIBOR to support the transition. Most contracts were transitioned to new rates in July and August 2023, in accordance with fallback language. A small number of contracts utilize longer tenor LIBOR rates and will transition by early 2024 (6-month and 12-month LIBOR) based on contractual agreements. Truist has materially completed LIBOR transition efforts, primarily utilizing SOFR replacement rates, and closed formal project efforts as of September 2023. 

Fallback language used to remediate loan agreements was generally consistent with ARRC recommendations and included use of &#8220;hardwired fallback&#8221; language, which transitioned loans to a SOFR based rate after June 30, 2023. For a small number of wholesale contracts remaining without fallback language, Truist leveraged the LIBOR Act and corresponding safe harbor provision to transition these loans to SOFR. Truist&#8217;s consumer lending portfolios included fallback language to transition to SOFR, based on lender discretion and as supported by the LIBOR Act; therefore, these contracts did not require remediation and also benefit from the safe harbor provisions of the LIBOR Act. 

Derivatives that reference LIBOR transitioned to a SOFR-based replacement rate as set forth in the ISDA protocol addressing LIBOR fallbacks between the Company and its counterparties which have adhered to the protocol, through bilateral amendments between the Company and each of its counterparties, or as established under the LIBOR Act and rules promulgated thereunder by the FRB. Fallback language used to remediate LIBOR based derivatives was generally consistent with ISDA publications. 

The Company&#8217;s preferred securities and the Company&#8217;s and Truist Bank&#8217;s floating rate notes that reference LIBOR transitioned to a SOFR based rate utilizing application of the LIBOR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the FRB. Truist announced that these securities would move to a 3-month adjusted Term SOFR in accordance with the LIBOR Act. See &#8220;Note 12. Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; for information about preferred stock using LIBOR. 

Market Risk from Trading Activities 

As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with Truist&#8217;s risk appetite. 

Truist Financial Corporation 71 

Truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule. 

Covered Trading Positions 

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the Company&#8217;s clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist&#8217;s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures. 

Valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. Additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. See &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures,&#8221; and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies. 

Securitizations 

As of December 31, 2023, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule, which were non-agency asset backed securities positions, was $49 million. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist&#8217;s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period. 

Correlation Trading Positions 

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of December 31, 2023. 

VaR-Based Measures 

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits. 

The trading portfolio&#8217;s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

72 Truist Financial Corporation 

##TABLE_START Table 33: VaR-based Measures Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (Dollars in millions) 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period 10-Day Holding Period 1-Day Holding Period VaR-based Measures: Maximum $ 30 $ 14 $ 38 $ 14 Average 17 7 17 5 Minimum 10 4 6 3 Period-end 23 11 20 6 VaR by Risk Class: Interest Rate Risk 5 6 Credit Spread Risk 2 8 Equity Price Risk 5 1 Foreign Exchange Risk 1 &#8212; Portfolio Diversification (2) (9) Period-end 11 6 ##TABLE_END

Stressed VaR-based measures 

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company&#8217;s trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures: 

##TABLE_START Table 34: Stressed VaR-based Measures - 10 Day Holding Period Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Maximum $ 164 $ 109 Average 76 70 Minimum 25 40 Period-end 79 77 ##TABLE_END

Compared to the prior year, Stressed VaR measures were generally higher, primarily due to higher market making inventory and lower diversification benefits in 2023. 

Specific Risk Measures 

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g., default or event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply. 

VaR Model Backtesting 

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, there were no Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The total number of Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months. 

Truist Financial Corporation 73 

Model Risk Oversight 

MRO is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRO policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and identify potential model enhancement. 

Stress Testing 

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large, unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for risk factor sensitivities, historical repeats and hypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity horizons of key risk factors. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company&#8217;s comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company&#8217;s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the &#8220;Capital&#8221; section of MD&#38;A for additional discussion of capital adequacy. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, unwillingness or inability of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty such that an obligation will not be repaid on time and/or in full or the client and/or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation to the Company or its affiliates. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. Credit risk arises when Truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. Credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the Company or its affiliates holds has deteriorated. 

Truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk: 

&#8226; limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower; 

&#8226; establishing a process for credit approval accountability; 

&#8226; careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market, and collateral risks; 

&#8226; ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships; 

&#8226; maintaining collections and asset resolution teams; 

74 Truist Financial Corporation 

&#8226; continuous monitoring of the portfolio, concentration and transactional limits, emerging risks, market dynamics and the economy; and 

&#8226; periodically reevaluating the Company&#8217;s strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change. 

The following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of Truist&#8217;s lending function. 

Underwriting Approach 

The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to Truist&#8217;s long-term financial success. Truist&#8217;s underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to Truist&#8217;s risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals: 

&#8226; Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower&#8217;s cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources. 

&#8226; Secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source. 

&#8226; Value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower&#8217;s normal cash flows. 

&#8226; Overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client&#8217;s relationships, both past and current, with Truist and other lenders - Truist&#8217;s success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background. 

&#8226; Level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances. 

Refer to the &#8220;Lending Activities&#8221; section in MD&#38;A for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) Truist cannot easily monetize assets without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk). Refer to the &#8220;Liquidity&#8221; section in MD&#38;A for additional discussion. 

Technology Risk 

Technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence, and adoption of information technology across the Company. Truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program, and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains, and capabilities to manage this risk. 

Cybersecurity risk management and strategy 

Like other financial services firms, Truist faces an increasingly complex and evolving cybersecurity threat environment. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for information on risks from cybersecurity threats. We maintain a risk-based cybersecurity framework that is part of our enterprise-wide risk management framework. It is implemented through people, processes, and technology, whereby we assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, and seek to continually adapt our risk mitigation activities accordingly. 

Our cybersecurity framework is aligned with industry standards such as those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, and is designed to conform to the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, our cybersecurity framework includes internally and third-party focused capabilities that drive the development and implementation of our data security strategy, which is designed to reduce cybersecurity risk while enabling Truist&#8217;s corporate business objectives. Truist&#8217;s cybersecurity strategy is enabled by Truist&#8217;s multilayered defenses, including capabilities that are designed for early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery. 

Truist Financial Corporation 75 

Processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats 

As part of our enterprise risk management framework, we have implemented and maintain a program to assess, identify, and manage risks arising from the cybersecurity threats facing Truist. Truist maintains cybersecurity and information security policies, procedures, and technologies that are designed to address regulatory requirements and protect our clients&#8217;, teammates&#8217; and our own data against unauthorized disclosure, modification, and misuse. These policies, procedures, and technologies cover a broad range of areas, including: identification of internal and external threats, access control, data security, protective controls, detection of malicious or unauthorized activity, incident response, and recovery planning. 

Truist participates in the federally recognized Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center as a key part of the Company&#8217;s cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing. To further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, Truist provides data protection guidance to clients and promotes data protection awareness and accountability through mandatory teammate training. Truist conducts scenario-driven test exercises simulating impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. These exercises are designed to assess the viability of Truist&#8217;s crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement. Where a potential cybersecurity threat is identified in our environment, our Cyber Incident Response Team evaluates the potential impact to Truist and coordinates remediation where required. Our Cyber Incident Response Team also manages significant cyber-specific events, with escalation to executive management and the Board, as appropriate. 

Our cybersecurity framework is also designed to help oversee, identify, and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-party service providers. Following an initial assessment of the level of enterprise risk potentially posed by use of the third-party, the service provider is then subject to further risk-based assessments on its operational resilience and cybersecurity practices, including disaster recovery and business continuity plans that specify the time frame to resume activities and recover data. In its agreements with third-party service providers, Truist then requires service providers to adhere to Truist&#8217;s relevant cybersecurity and operational resilience standards, subject to certain exceptions that are managed on a case-by-case basis. 

Our cybersecurity framework is routinely assessed to ensure the effectiveness of key controls through third-party cybersecurity maturity measurements, technology risk oversight, compliance risk management testing and monitoring, internal audit review, and regulatory oversight. 

In addition, Truist continues to strengthen its cross-functional, holistic approach to enterprise resilience by addressing potential amplification of risks from significant technology, cybersecurity and data incidents. As part of these efforts, Truist is deepening capabilities for both disaster recovery and restoration, along with the implementation of other resilience measures. 

Management&#8217;s role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats 

Truist&#8217;s cybersecurity framework is operated and maintained by management, including the CIO, CISO, CRO and CTRO. These senior officers are responsible for assessing and managing Truist&#8217;s cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity framework strategy, which is overseen by CISO, is informed by various risk and control assessments, control testing, external assessments, threat intelligence, and public and private information sharing. Our cybersecurity framework also includes processes for escalating and considering the materiality of incidents that impact Truist, including escalation to executive management and the Board, which are periodically tested through tabletop exercises to test Truist&#8217;s preparedness. 

In addition, our Technology Management Committee is an internal committee created to ensure that members of executive management overseeing multiple business units understand pertinent technology-related topics, including cybersecurity and information security, and associated risks. The Technology Management Committee provides additional oversight of cybersecurity and information security strategy, including understanding and prioritizing cybersecurity and information security capabilities and associated risks. 

The members of management that lead our Cybersecurity Program and strategy have extensive experience in technology, cybersecurity, and information security. Our CIO of has over 25 years of experience leading cybersecurity teams at financial institutions, including in the areas of information technology strategy, risk management, and information security. Following the departure of our CISO in January 2024, we have appointed an interim CISO while our search for a permanent CISO continues. Our interim CISO has over 20 years of experience as a technology and information security executive in the financial services industry, including serving as CISO at two different financial institutions and as a supervising examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

76 Truist Financial Corporation 

Board of Directors&#8217; oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats 

Our Board has primary responsibility for the oversight of our enterprise risk management, and exercises its oversight function in respect of cybersecurity risk through two of its committees. The Risk Committee of the Board is responsible for oversight of Truist&#8217;s risk management function, involving approving and reviewing Truist&#8217;s risk management framework and policies as well as overseeing management&#8217;s implementation of Truist&#8217;s risk management framework and significant risk policies. In addition, the Technology Committee of the Board assists the Board and the Risk Committee in oversight of Truist&#8217;s technology risks. 

The oversight responsibility of our Board and its committees is facilitated through management-reporting processes designed to provide visibility to the Board and its committees on the processes for the identification, assessment, prioritization and management of critical risks and management&#8217;s risk mitigation strategies. For example, members of the Risk Committee receive regular reports from our CRO and CTRO related to information technology and cybersecurity risks to Truist. The Risk Committee may also meet throughout the year with risk management advisors and discuss with executive management any recommendations received. In addition, the Technology Committee receives reports from management regarding Truist&#8217;s practices, management, and functioning of technology operations and cybersecurity and information security risks, and reviews and discusses Truist&#8217;s technology policies, standards and controls. On at least a semi-annual basis, the Technology Committee reports to the Risk Committee the significant activities undertaken by the Technology Committee involving oversight of technology risks in support of the Risk Committee&#8217;s overall responsibility and oversight of Truist&#8217;s risk management framework. The CISO provides updates at every Technology Committee meeting on cybersecurity and information security risk, and the Board annually reviews and approves our Information Security Program and Information Security Policy. 

Truist provides ongoing development and education to its directors with respect to cybersecurity, including presentations at Board meetings on special topics, such as updates on cybersecurity legislation and regulation, as well as making available written materials and video presentations to directors for review at their own pace. The Board also conducts a cybersecurity tabletop exercise at least every other year to simulate Truist&#8217;s analysis and response to hypothetical cybersecurity incidents. In addition, Truist provides directors with a Board Cybersecurity Handbook that provides details on key Truist practices, resources and protocols relating to cybersecurity protection, response and preparedness. Finally, as required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Board receives an update at least annually on Truist&#8217;s information security program. 

Data Risk 

Truist is subject to risk that data may be negatively impacted by integrity, quality, availability, and privacy, which could potentially impact regulatory and management reporting, public disclosures, and business decisions. Truist recognizes the importance of maintaining accurate and reliable data and maintains a formal data risk management program to mitigate risks related to data fidelity. Through active data risk monitoring and accuracy testing, Truist provides reasonable assurance over the quality and retention of key data used for operational, strategic, regulatory, and compliance purposes. Management and the Board provide oversight of the data risk management program and receive regular updates from the Chief Data Risk Officer. While the current data risk management program identifies and mitigates data risk, the data risk program must be dynamic and is actively expanding oversight to enhance data risk management capabilities to achieve the data risk management objectives defined in the strategic plan. 

Compliance Risk 

Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures or ethical standards. This risk exposes Truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities, increased costs and expenses, and lessened expansion potential. 

Strategic Risk 

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, stock price, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by setting and successfully executing established business strategies to deliver on earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with key stakeholder constituencies. 

Truist Financial Corporation 77 

Reputational Risk 

Truist manages reputational risk under an established risk management framework that includes established policies and procedures embedded within its existing business and risk management processes. The Company proactively monitors, identifies, and internally escalates potential reputational risk events and endeavors to mitigate such reputational risks in a timely manner. Truist takes pride with ensuring transparent and accurate communication, both internally and externally, to respond to key stakeholders on issues or events that give rise to potential reputational risk. Truist utilizes an established risk taxonomy that is used to help identify, measure, and monitor reputational risk that enables clear transparently communication to stakeholders on the level of potential risk faced by the Company which in turn allows for effective management of risk to acceptable levels. 

Truist is committed to operating in a manner that reflects the Company&#8217;s stated Purpose, Mission, and Values and seeks to protect its reputation, public confidence, and resilience by identifying and evaluating associated risks that conflict with the expectations of the Company&#8217;s internal and external stakeholders, including clients, teammates, investors, regulators, and communities. 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. An operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk. 

Model Risk 

Model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. Valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. Valuation models are also used as inputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself, regulatory capital, stress testing, and the ACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs, who are responsible for the development, implementation, and use of their models. Oversight of these functions is performed by the MRO, which is a component of the RMO. Once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. Models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities, and other developments. 

MRO manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. The risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. Additionally, MRO maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. Regarding model validation, MRO utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation, and conceptual soundness. On certain occasions, the MRO will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. Once in a production environment, MRO assesses a model&#8217;s performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. MRO tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. MRO gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators, which are periodically reported to relevant committees, including but not limited to, the Model Risk Management Committee and the ERC. MRO will also present model risk topics to the Board Risk Committee as necessary. 

Liquidity 

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale. 

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist&#8217;s funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding, and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities. 

78 Truist Financial Corporation 

Internal Liquidity Stress Testing 

Liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. The types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, and increased draws on unfunded commitments. To mitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment. 

Truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and Truist&#8217;s liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as HQLA under the LCR Rule. 

Contingency Funding Plan 

Truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization&#8217;s liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan&#8217;s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction. 

LCR and HQLA 

The LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist Bank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational requirements of the LCR rule. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist held average weighted eligible HQLA of $84.9 billion and Truist&#8217;s average LCR was 112% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. 

Effective July 2021, Truist became subject to final rules implementing the NSFR, which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. At December 31, 2023, Truist was compliant with this requirement. 

Sources of Funds 

Management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Truist&#8217;s on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders&#8217; equity. Truist Bank&#8217;s primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested. 

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. Available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity. The following table presents a summary of Truist Bank&#8217;s available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the FRB: 

##TABLE_START Table 35: Selected Liquidity Sources (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Unused borrowing capacity: FRB $ 55,252 $ 49,250 FHLB 24,712 20,770 Available investment securities (after haircuts) 

74,717 85,401 Available secured borrowing capacity 154,681 155,421 Eligible cash at the FRB 25,085 15,556 Total $ 179,766 $ 170,977 ##TABLE_END

At December 31, 2023, Truist Bank&#8217;s available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 3.4 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less. Truist additionally has the ability to increase sources of funding by pledging available investment securities to receive the par value of the collateral under the FRB Bank Term Funding Program. 

Truist Financial Corporation 79 

Parent Company 

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company&#8217;s assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, and payments on and, from time-to-time, potential repurchases or redemptions of a portion of an outstanding tranche of the long-term debt of the Parent Company (as may be permitted by the terms of each respective series). See &#8220;Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information&#8221; for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions. 

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Parent Company had 48 months and 37 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 30 months and 22 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the Company&#8217;s ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. Credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. The Company&#8217;s credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings: 

The following table presents the credit ratings and outlooks of Truist and Truist Bank as of December 31, 2023: ##TABLE_START Table 36: Credit Ratings of Truist Financial Corporation and Truist Bank &#160; Moody&#8217;s S&#38;P Fitch DBRS Morningstar Truist Financial Corporation: Issuer A3 A- / A-2 A+ / F1 AAL / R-1M Senior unsecured A3 A- A AAL Subordinated A3 BBB+ A- AH Preferred stock Baa2(hyb) BBB- BBB AL Truist Bank: Issuer A2 A / A-1 A+ / F1 AA / R-1H Senior unsecured A2 A A+ AA Deposits Aa3 / P-1 NA AA- / F1+ AA Subordinated (P) A2 A- A AAL Ratings outlook: Credit trend Negative Stable Negative Stable ##TABLE_END

Changes in the Company&#8217;s credit ratings and outlooks during 2023 include: 

&#8226; On March 31, 2023, S&#38;P Global Ratings affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised the outlook on those ratings to &#8220;stable&#8221; from &#8220;positive,&#8221; citing heightened market volatility in the wake of bank failures in the first half of 2023 and, with inflation still elevated, higher uncertainty, and greater downside risk in the economic outlook. The change in outlook was part of a broader action by S&#38;P Global Ratings whereby the &#8220;positive&#8221; outlook on three other large U.S. banks was revised to &#8220;stable.&#8221; 

&#8226; On August 7, 2023, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service placed the long-term ratings and certain short-term ratings of Truist and Truist Bank &#8220;under review for downgrade,&#8221; citing Truist&#8217;s comparatively low, though improving, level of capitalization, along with weaknesses in asset-liability management. The review also reflects the view of Moody&#8217;s Investor Service that the stability of U.S. banks&#8217; deposit funding has declined, as reflected in the agency&#8217;s decision to lower the U.S. macro profile. 

80 Truist Financial Corporation 

&#8226; On August 11, 2023, DBRS, Inc. affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and maintained a &#8220;stable&#8221; ratings outlook, citing Truist&#8217;s highly scaled and diversified regional banking franchise, conservative risk profile, and sound liquidity management and capital levels. In affirming the ratings, DBRS, Inc. also noted the ratings take into account the more challenging operating environment and the expectation that funding costs and asset quality metrics could worsen from current levels, providing some pressure to earnings, and that credit deterioration associated with normalization of the credit cycle would be manageable. 

&#8226; On August 21, 2023, S&#38;P Global Ratings affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and maintained a &#8220;stable&#8221; ratings outlook, citing Truist&#8217;s strong market position and diversified business model as a substantial offset to deposit and margin pressures. S&#38;P Global Ratings viewed Truist&#8217;s capital ratios unfavorably after considering unrealized losses on securities but also wrote that Truist has the earnings capacity to build its capital ratios and support franchise growth over time. 

&#8226; On October 16, 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised the ratings outlook to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable.&#8221; In affirming Truist&#8217;s ratings, Fitch Ratings cited the company&#8217;s diverse revenue model, solid asset quality, and expected capital build over the rating horizon; however, the &#8220;negative&#8221; ratings outlook reflects the view of Fitch Ratings that Truist currently has less &#8220;headroom&#8221; to face increasing earnings pressures than similarly-rated peers. 

&#8226; On November 1, 2023, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised the outlook on those ratings to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;rating under review for downgrade.&#8221; The confirmation of Truist&#8217;s ratings reflects Moody&#8217;s Investor Service&#8217;s view that Truist should be able to continue to grow its capital ratios through earnings retention and balance sheet optimization activities, and also maintain adequate control of its asset liability management risks, including rising funding costs and its sizeable holdings of low-yielding, fixed-rate assets. 

&#8226; On February 20, 2024, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service placed the long-term ratings and certain short-term ratings of Truist and Truist Bank &#8220;under review for downgrade,&#8221; citing that even though its capitalization will improve materially, Truist will be less diversified and will have greater reliance on net interest income, and as a consequence of these factors, it will likely have greater earnings volatility following the sale of TIH. 

&#8226; On February 20, 2024, Fitch Ratings downgraded the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank to &#8216;A&#8217; from &#8216;A+&#8217; following the announced sale of TIH. Fitch has also downgraded TFC and Truist Bank&#8217;s viability rating to &#8216;a&#8217; from &#8216;a+.&#8217; The rating outlook is &#8220;stable.&#8221; Fitch Ratings cited: (i) TIH as largest source of fee income; (ii) the segment has grown faster than rest of the bank and benefited from higher inflation in recent years; and (iii) the sale will result in a less diverse business mix than similarly-rated peers. 

&#8226; On February 20, 2024, DBRS, Inc. affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and maintained a &#8220;stable&#8221; ratings outlook, citing the sale of the remaining stake in TIH has no impact on the Company&#8217;s credit ratings. 

&#8226; On February 22, 2024, S&#38;P Global Ratings affirmed its &#8216;A-/A-2&#8217; issuer credit ratings on Truist and its &#8216;A/A-1&#8217; ratings on Truist Bank, citing that the TIH sale will significantly boost Truist&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios, enhance Truist&#8217;s liquidity, and help fund continued organic growth in its core banking businesses. The outlook on the long-term ratings is stable. 

Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet Truist&#8217;s current requirements and plans for continued growth. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.3 billion in obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Many of the purchase obligations have terms that are not fixed and determinable and are included in the total amount of obligations based upon the estimated timing and amount of payment. In addition, certain of the purchase agreements contain clauses that would allow Truist to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in determining the total amount of obligations. See &#8220;Note 9. Other Assets and Liabilities,&#8221; &#8220;Note 11. Borrowings,&#8221; and &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations. 

Capital 

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist&#8217;s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist&#8217;s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets. 

Truist Financial Corporation 81 

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company&#8217;s capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management&#8217;s objective is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital limits, which are above the regulatory &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; minimums. Management has implemented internal stress capital ratio minimums to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above internal minimums. Breaches of internal stressed minimums prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist&#8217;s capital plan. ##TABLE_START Table 37: Capital Requirements &#160; Minimum Capital Well-Capitalized Minimum Capital Plus Stress Capital Buffer (1)

(1) Reflects a SCB requirement of 2.9% applicable to Truist as of December 31, 2023. Truist&#8217;s SCB requirement, received in the 2023 CCAR process, is effective from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 

Payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. In addition, management closely monitors the Parent Company&#8217;s double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders&#8217; equity). The active management of the subsidiaries&#8217; equity capital is the process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key element in the management of Truist&#8217;s capital position. 

Management intends to maintain capital at Truist Bank at levels that exceed the minimum capital plus CCB. This will also result in Truist Bank being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is management&#8217;s intent to maintain Truist Bank&#8217;s capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity, and risk profile. If the capital levels of Truist Bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the Parent Company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations. 

Management&#8217;s capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, (iii) strategic opportunities and acquisitions, and (iv) share repurchases if excess capital is available. 

Truist Bank&#8217;s capital ratios are presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START Table 38: Capital Ratios - Truist Bank Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 CET1 11.7 % 10.6 % Tier 1 capital 11.7 10.6 Total capital 13.3 12.1 Leverage ratio 9.2 8.5 Supplementary leverage ratio 7.9 7.3 ##TABLE_END

Truist&#8217;s capital ratios are presented in the following table: ##TABLE_START Table 39: Capital Ratios - Truist Financial Corporation (Dollars in millions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Risk-based: &#160; CET1 10.1 % 9.0 % Tier 1 capital 11.6 10.5 Total capital 13.7 12.4 Leverage ratio 9.3 8.5 Supplementary leverage ratio 7.9 7.3 Risk-weighted assets $ 423,705 $ 434,413 ##TABLE_END

Truist&#8217;s capital level at December 31, 2023 remains strong compared to the regulatory levels for well-capitalized banks. Truist&#8217;s CET1 ratio was 10.1% as of December 31, 2023. The 110 basis point increase since December 31, 2022 resulted from organic capital generation and the minority stake sale in TIH, partially offset by the CECL phase in. The remaining CECL phase in will be amortized ratably in the first quarters of 2024 and 2025. 

Truist paid $2.8 billion in common stock dividends, or $2.08 per share, during 2023, compared to $2.7 billion, or $2.00 per share, for 2022. Truist did not have any share repurchases for 2023 and repurchased $250 million in common stock in 2022. In early 2024, Truist declared common dividends of $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2024.

Reclassifications 

In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders&#8217; equity or net income. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for additional discussion regarding reclassifications. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The financial position and results of operations are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding Truist&#8217;s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, Truist&#8217;s significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation.&#8221; 

The following is a summary of Truist&#8217;s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions, and judgments. These critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a periodic basis. 

ACL 

Truist&#8217;s ACL represents management&#8217;s best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management&#8217;s judgement. The ACL estimation process includes both quantitatively calculated components as well as qualitative components. Quantitative models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Certain loans or leases that do not have similar risk characteristics are individually evaluated when establishing an allowance for expected credit losses. The macroeconomic forecast data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. Beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one-year period. As a means of addressing uncertainty related to future economic conditions, the quantitative allowance components include an adjustment that reflects model outputs calculated using a range of potential future economic conditions. Expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or to capture the losses expected at the balance sheet date or prior to January 1, 2023 it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a TDR. 

The qualitative components of the ACL incorporate management&#8217;s judgment in determining qualitative adjustments where model outputs are inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations with respect to expected credit losses. The qualitative components are used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to current economic conditions, and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models. 

Management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process. Under the range of scenarios considered as of December 31, 2023, use of the Company&#8217;s pessimistic scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately $2.2 billion. This estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario. 

The Company individually evaluates expected credits losses related to loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and prior to January 1, 2023 loans that have been classified as a TDR. For individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any, while prior to January 1, 2023 for TDRs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL. 

The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the ALLL and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ACL is included in &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation.&#8221;

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. Refer to &#8220;Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures&#8221; for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and &#8220;Note 2. Business Combinations, Divestitures, and Noncontrolling Interests&#8221; for additional disclosures regarding business combinations. 

Securities 

Truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its AFS investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. Fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. Management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. These procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible business unit, include comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. The Enterprise Valuation Committee, which provides oversight to Truist&#8217;s enterprise-wide IPV function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by IPV for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions. 

MSRs 

Truist&#8217;s primary class of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, Truist estimates the fair value of residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS valuation model to project residential MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential MSR asset. 

Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value of residential MSRs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of MSRs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential MSRs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. Truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential MSRs. Refer to &#8220;Note 8. Loan Servicing&#8221; for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management&#8217;s assumptions would have on the fair value of residential MSRs. 

LHFS 

Truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as components of Mortgage banking income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in Personnel expense when incurred. The changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the LHFS. Truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. LHFS also includes certain loans, generally carried at LOCOM, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. The fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available. When observable market prices are not available, the Company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for further description of the Company&#8217;s accounting for LHFS. 

84 Truist Financial Corporation 

Trading Loans 

Truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. Specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the C&#38;CB segment, or (iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to &#8220;Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; and &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; for further discussion of the Company&#8217;s TRS business. The loans purchased in connection with the Company&#8217;s TRS and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third-party pricing service. SBA loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value. 

Derivative Assets and Liabilities 

Truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. Truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to Truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that Truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. Refer to &#8220;Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; for further information on the Company&#8217;s derivatives. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. This often involves estimates based on third-party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. The amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. Business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. Refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; for a description of the impairment testing process. 

At December 31, 2023, Truist&#8217;s reporting units with goodwill balances were CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB, and IH. Management performs a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. For its annual impairment review, Truist performed a quantitative test of each of its reporting units. The quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and a market-based approach, weighted 50% and 50%, respectively. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multi-year financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and required capital. The market based approach utilizes comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable. 

Truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies, historic bank control premiums, and the current market. 

The projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of October 1, 2023, based on management&#8217;s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. The discount rates utilized for the CB&#38;W, C&#38;CB, and IH reporting units as of October 1, 2023 were 13.5%, 12.5%, and 11.0%, respectively. 

Truist Financial Corporation 85 

Based on the Company&#8217;s annual impairment test of goodwill, it was determined for the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units that the respective reporting units&#8217; carrying value was in excess of its respective fair value as of October 1, 2023, resulting in a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The goodwill impairment was primarily due to the continued impact of higher interest rates and discount rates on the CB&#38;W and C&#38;CB reporting units, and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices, including Truist&#8217;s. For the IH reporting unit, it was determined that the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of October 1, 2023. 

The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in management&#8217;s estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. Circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value of Truist&#8217;s reporting units in the future include a sustained decrease in Truist&#8217;s stock price, continued decline in industry peer multiples, an increase in the applicable discount rate and further deterioration in the reporting units&#8217; forecasts. Additionally, a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value could change based on market conditions, change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value. 

The Company monitored events and circumstances during the period from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Truist specific performance indicators, a comparison of management&#8217;s forecast and assumptions to those used in its October 1, 2023 quantitative impairment test, and the sensitivity of the October 1, 2023 quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through December 31, 2023. Based on these considerations, management concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of December 31, 2023. 

Income Taxes 

Truist is subject to income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which the Company conducts business. In estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the Company&#8217;s tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. Truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available. 

Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. The Company regularly evaluates the ability to realize DTAs, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the Company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. Truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards. For additional income tax information, refer to &#8220;Note 1. Basis of Presentation&#8221; and &#8220;Note 14.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations 

Truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an AA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations. 

Management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. For the Company&#8217;s qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $29 million for 2024, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $145 million in pension expense for 2024. This estimate reflects the sensitivity of certain factors considered in calculation of pension expense but does not consider all factors that could increase or decrease estimates calculated.
