MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02111 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 (Form 10-Q), unless the
context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar
terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial strength to our
subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary,
State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street Bank, we provide
a broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide,
with $38.18 trillion of AUC/A and $3.48 trillion of AUM as of June 30, 2022.
As of June 30, 2022, we had consolidated total assets of $300.22 billion,
consolidated total deposits of $241.91 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $25.77 billion and 40,354 employees. We operate in more than 100 geographic
markets worldwide, including in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East and
Asia.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of the Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2021 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 previously filed with the SEC
(2021 Form 10-K). You should read the financial information contained in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q in
conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our 2021 Form 10-
K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-Q have been
reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters
that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
• accounting for fair value measurements;
• allowance for credit losses;
• impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex
judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision
as new information becomes available. For additional information about these
significant accounting policies refer to pages 124 to 126, “Significant Accounting
Estimates” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-K. We did not
change these significant accounting policies in the first six months of 2022.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, or
reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis. We measure and compare certain financial
information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management uses in
evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information should be
considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial
information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial
information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP-basis
measure.
We further believe that our presentation of FTE NII, a non-GAAP measure,
which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with taxexempt investment securities, on a FTE basis, facilitates an investor's
understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory
standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with
respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading
activities) and the

LCR, summary results of semi-annual State Street-run stress tests which we
conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan disclosures required under
the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional disclosures are accessible on the “Investor
Relations” section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual
reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and
abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us
under the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other
public statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in
our Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as
applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
U.S. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations
regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations,
strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio
performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, acquisitions (including,
without limitation, our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business),
outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, joint ventures and divestitures,
client growth and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry,
governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and
developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate
strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,” “forecast,”
“outlook,” “believe,” “priority,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “trend,”
“target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms, are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
which change over time, are based on management's expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future
results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of
the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of
factors affecting
the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the equity, debt,
currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to State Street and
its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could cause changes in
the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based
cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not limited to:
Strategic Risks
• The consummation of our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor
Services business is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the
satisfaction of other closing conditions, the failure or delay of which may
prevent or further delay the consummation of the acquisition;
• We have been engaged in discussions with banking regulators regarding
our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business and have
developed with BBH proposed modifications to the proposed acquisition,
including changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and
changes to regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction.
These proposed modifications may facilitate resolution of the regulatory
review process and provide a path to consummating the transaction. As part
of the discussions with BBH, State Street is seeking amendments to the
transaction terms, including the purchase price. Any modification to the
transaction terms would be subject to review and approval by both BBH and
our Board of Directors, and there can be no assurance that a mutually
acceptable modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or
outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for that modified transaction; and absent further agreement of the parties, after
September 6, 2022 either party can terminate the transaction without
penalty;
• Assuming the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications to our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services
business are timely finalized and contracted, subject to regulatory approval
and other closing conditions, the parties are aiming to close the transaction
at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022; however, there exists significant
timing uncertainty and risk that closing will extend beyond that timeline; and
even if we successfully consummate a modified transaction, we may fail to
realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or the
benefits may take longer to realize than expected;
State Street Corporation | 5
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• We are subject to intense competition, which could negatively affect our
profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability in our financial
results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and services, including
State Street Digital and State Street Alpha, and the enhancement of our
infrastructure required to meet increased regulatory and client expectations
for resiliency and the systems and process re-engineering necessary to
achieve improved productivity and reduced operating risk, may take an
extended period to implement, involve costs and expose us to increased
risk;
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and
maintain our technology infrastructure;
• The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate certain risks and
uncertainties for our business;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and the
integration, retention and development of the benefits of our acquisitions,
pose risks for our business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support
our business.
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by geopolitical, economic and market
conditions; including, for example, as a result of the present war in Ukraine;
• We have significant International operations, and disruptions in European
and Asian economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations or financial condition;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and
consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes
in the financial markets;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk to counterparties, who may also have
substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions, and
these credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial
loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our consolidated
revenue and is subject to decline based on, among other factors, market
conditions, competition, currency valuation and investment activities of our
clients and their business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, our
consolidated financial condition, capital ratios, results of operations and
business prospects could be adversely affected;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not
be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an actual or
perceived reduction in our financial strength, our borrowing and capital
costs, liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common share
repurchases, may be adversely affected by capital and liquidity standards
required as a result of capital stress testing;
• We face extensive and changing government regulation in the jurisdictions
in which we operate, which may increase our costs and compliance risks;
• We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of the resolution
of prior regulatory or governmental matters;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and
litigation;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have
an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory
actions, litigation and other adverse effects;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios depend on
data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are
subject to change, which could materially impact our risk exposures, our
total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated
financial statements;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions
and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our
effective tax rate; and
State Street Corporation | 6
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• The transition away from LIBOR may result in additional costs and
increased risk exposure.
Operational Risks
• Our control environment may be inadequate, fail or be circumvented, and
operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of
operations;
• Cost shifting to non-U.S. jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to
increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and reputational harm and may
not result in expected cost savings;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or
facilities, or those of the third parties with which we do business, or
disruptions to our or their continuous operations, could result in significant
costs, reputational damage and impacts on our business activities;
• Long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk;
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other
reputational harm;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors
that could result in material harm;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur
substantial losses or are restricted in redeeming their interests in
investment pools that we sponsor or manage;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses to such risks,
could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including terrorist
attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a new pandemic or acts of
embezzlement.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our
forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the
factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our
other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be
relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no
obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made.
The factors discussed herein are not intended
to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties that may affect our
businesses. We cannot anticipate all developments that may adversely affect our
business or operations or our consolidated results of operations, financial condition
or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions and should
not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in
State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings,
including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our
annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act
of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the

 Not meaningful
The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section provides information
related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial
results for the second quarter of 2022 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial
Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including
the comparison of our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30,
2022, compared to the same periods in 2021, is provided under “Consolidated
Results of Operations”, "Line of Business Information" and "Capital" which follows
these sections, as well as in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-
Q. In this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of
changes in foreign currency translation, those effects are determined by applying
applicable weighted average FX rates from the relevant 2021 period to the relevant
2022 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Second quarter of 2022 financial performance:
◦ Earnings per share of $1.91 in the second quarter of 2022,
decreased 8% compared to $2.07 in the same period in 2021.
◦ Total fee revenue and total revenue decreased 6% and 3%,
respectively, in the second quarter of 2022, compared to the same
period in 2021. Currency translation decreased both fee revenue
and total revenue by 2% in the second quarter of 2022, relative to
the same period in 2021.
◦ NII increased 25% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021.
◦ In the second quarter of 2022, return on equity of 12.1% decreased
from 12.6% in the same period in 2021, primarily due to a decrease
in net income available to common shareholders. Pre-tax margin of
28.3% in the second quarter of 2022, decreased from 30.9% in the
same period in 2021, primarily due to a decrease in total revenue.
◦ Negative operating leverage of 2.5% points in the second quarter of
2022. Operating leverage represents the difference between the
percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in
total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
◦ Negative fee operating leverage of 5.6% points in the second
quarter of 2022. Fee operating leverage represents the difference
between the percentage change in total fee revenue and the
percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the
prior year period.
• While the ongoing war in Ukraine continued to cause considerable
challenges for global markets in the second quarter of 2022, our direct
financial exposure to Russia remains very low. As of June 30, 2022, we had
no direct credit exposures to Russian-domiciled entities, including the
Russian central bank, other than our subcustodian in Russia, which is an
affiliate of a large multinational bank.
Revenue
• Total revenue decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to
the same period in 2021, as the decrease in total fee revenue was partially
offset by higher NII. Total fee revenue decreased 6% in the second quarter
of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by lower
servicing fees, management fees, software and processing fees and other
fee revenue, partially offset by higher foreign exchange trading services
revenue. Currency translation decreased both total revenue and total fee
revenue by 2% in the second quarter of 2022, relative to the same period in
2021
• Servicing fee revenue decreased 7% in the second quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower average equity
and fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, lower client
activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially
offset by net new business. Currency translation decreased servicing fee
revenue by 3% in the second quarter of 2022, relative to the same period in
2021.
• Management fee revenue decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower average equity
and fixed income market levels, a client-specific pricing adjustment, and the
impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact
of money market fee waivers and net inflows from ETFs. Currency
translation decreased management fees by 2% in the second quarter of
2022, relative to the same period in 2021.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue increased 16% in the second
quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting
higher FX spreads, partially offset by lower client FX volumes.
• Securities finance revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting lower agency and
enhanced custody balances, partially offset by higher spreads.
• Software and processing fees revenue decreased 11% in the second
quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to
lower front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
• Other fee revenue decreased $53 million in the second quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to negative marketrelated adjustments.
• NII increased 25% in the second quarter of 2022, compared to the same
period in 2021, primarily due to higher market interest rates and growth in
loan balances.
Provision for Credit Losses
• We recorded a $10 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter
of 2022, compared to a $15 million reserve release in the same period in
2021, reflecting a downward shift in management's economic outlook,
partially offset by a decrease in expected losses related to leveraged loans
within our portfolio.
Expenses
• Total expenses were flat in the second quarter of 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021, as higher targeted business investments and wage
growth were offset by productivity savings and ongoing disciplined expense
management, and the positive impact of currency translation. Currency
translation decreased expenses by 3% in the second quarter of 2022,
relative to the same period in 2021.
Notable items
• The impact of notable items in the second quarter of 2022 includes
acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately $12 million related to
our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business, which is
subject to regulatory review and other closing conditions.
• The impact of notable items in the second quarter of 2021 includes:
State Street Corporation | 9
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
◦ $53 million gain on the sale of a majority share of our Wealth
Management Services (WMS) business, recorded in other income;
◦ legal accrual release of approximately $11 million; and
◦ acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately $11 million,
primarily related to our 2018 acquisition of CRD.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $38.18 trillion decreased 10% as of June 30, 2022, compared to
June 30, 2021, primarily due to lower market levels, partially offset by net
new business and client flows. In the second quarter of 2022, newly
announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $972 billion.
Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled
approximately $3.63 trillion as of June 30, 2022.
• AUM of $3.48 trillion decreased 11% as of June 30, 2022, compared to
June 30, 2021, primarily due to lower market levels and net outflows from
our Institutional business, partially offset by net inflows from our ETF and
Cash businesses.
Capital
• We declared common stock dividends of $0.57 per share, totaling
$210 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $0.52 per share,
totaling $179 million in the same period in 2021.
• In July 2022, we declared third quarter common stock dividends of $0.63
per share, representing a 10% increase on a per share basis from both the
third quarter of 2021 and second quarter of 2022.
• In July 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase plan of up
to $3.0 billion of our common stock through the end of 2022; however, in
connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services
business, we did not repurchase any common stock during the last half of
2021, as well as during the first half of 2022. In June 2022, we announced
our intention to resume our common share repurchases during the fourth
quarter of 2022 in an amount reflecting interest rate levels and market
conditions at that time.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 12.9% as of June 30,
2022, compared to 14.3% as of December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting
lower AOCI related
to AFS securities driven by the significant increase in rates across the yield
curve and the implementation of the standardized approach for counterparty
credit risk (SA-CCR), partially offset by planned RWA reductions and
optimization. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 6.0% as of June 30,
2022 compared to 6.1% as of December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower
AOCI, partially offset by lower consolidated average assets. During the
second quarter of 2022, we completed a number of our previously
announced actions to mitigate additional AOCI risk in the current
environment including a $21.23 billion transfer of securities from AFS to
HTM. Given the reduction in AOCI risk, we have the ability to operate with
CET1 and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios at or somewhat below the lower end
of our target ranges of 10-11% and 5.25-5.75%, respectively, after the close
of the proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business.
Debt Issuances and Redemptions
• On May 13, 2022, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of
4.421% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2033.
• On May 15, 2022, we redeemed $750 million aggregate principal amount of
2.653% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2023.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021, and
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including
changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to our clients,
including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to collectively as back office services, and middle office services. The nature and mix of
services provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding
impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our
clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party
information, AUC/A is reported on a lag, typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end market
levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately 3% on average with a
range of 0% to 7% annually and approximately 7% and 2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for
selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and
the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may
differ from those industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of June 30, 2022 that a 10%
increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a
corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain
constant and using relevant information as of June 30, 2022, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less
volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a significantly smaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire
transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors,
including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five
years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on average with a range of
(1)% to 2% annually and approximately 0% and 2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market
trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 1% on
average with a range of 0% to 3% annually and approximately 1% and 0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross new investment servicing mandates were $972 billion in the second
quarter of 2022 and $1.8 trillion per year on average over the past five years. Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, gross new annual investment servicing mandates
ranged from $750 billion to $3.5 trillion.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of
assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from
6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. Our more complex installations, including new State Street Alpha
mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $3.63 trillion that are yet to be installed as of June 30, 2022,
we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 36 months.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and
our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today.
Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from
announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can
vary materially. On average, over the five years ended December 31, 2021, we
estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our
servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (1)% to
(4)% in any given year, and approximately (2)% in both 2021 and 2020. Pricing
concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms
that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client,
expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on
manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The
timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional
services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to
the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time
required to onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client
investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact
the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, we
estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year; although,
notwithstanding increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to several
factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner in which we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and
the type of services and the other factors described in this Form 10-Q.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that
approximately 55%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable
due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of
AUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume
of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 30% of our
servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations
or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new
business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending
on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of
changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully
reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur,
particularly in periods of higher volatility.
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased 7% in the
three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels, normal pricing
headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency
translation, partially offset by net new business. Currency translation decreased
servicing fee revenue by 3% in the second quarter of 2022, relative to the same
period in 2021. Servicing fees decreased 4% in the six months ended June 30,
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to normal pricing
headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency
translation, partially offset by net new business. Currency translation decreased
servicing fee revenue by 2% in the six months ended June 30, 2022, relative to the
same period in 2021.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% of total
servicing fees in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to
approximately 49% and 48% in the same periods in 2021, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the second quarter of 2022
totaled approximately $972 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in
future periods totaled approximately $3.63 trillion as of June 30, 2022, which will be
reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee
revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be
realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that
period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive
agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary
regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining
to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been
contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly
disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These
excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new
asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed
in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and
servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross
basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us
during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us,
which may from time to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide
various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping,
transaction processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and
record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as
investment book of records (IBOR), transaction management, loans, cash,
derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment
analytics, markets services such as FX trading services, liquidity solutions, currency
and collateral management, securities finance, and front office services such as
portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis, performance and
attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and
environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment tools. Revenues
associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services
provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing
clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its ETF assets
currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending necessary
approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for
this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our
business. The transition is expected to begin in 2022, but will principally occur in
2023 and 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the fee revenue
associated with the transitioning assets represented approximately 1.9% of our total
2021 fee revenue. The actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will
reflect a range of factors, including potential growth in our continuing business with
the client and expense reductions associated with the transition.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report
based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of
managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective
Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of
AUM. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than
servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided,
and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets
managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While
certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the
investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for
clients. From the second half of 2020 through the first quarter of 2022, we were in a
prolonged low-interest rate environment, and waived certain fees for our clients for
money market products. Following the Federal Reserve rate hikes in March 2022,
money market fee waivers did not have a significant impact on our management fee
revenue in the second quarter of 2022, and we do not expect them to materially
impact subsequent quarters in 2022.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our
AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM
than for actively managed products. Actively managed products may also include
performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based
on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's
performance.
State Street Corporation | 15
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of June 30, 2022, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and
lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would
result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a
significantly smaller impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Year-end
indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant
indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.
Management fees decreased 3% in the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to same period in 2021, primarily due to lower average equity and fixed income market
levels, a client-specific pricing adjustment, and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and net inflows from
ETFs. Currency translation decreased management fees by 2% in the second quarter of 2022, relative to the same period in 2021. Management fees increased 1% in the six months
ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher average equity market levels and the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers,
partially offset by a client-specific pricing adjustment and the impact of currency translation. Currency translation decreased management fees by 1% in the six months ended June
30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 25% and 26% of total management fees in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to approximately 26% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total
Revenue, increased 16% and 9% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to higher FX
spreads, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Foreign exchange trading
services revenue comprises revenue generated by FX trading and revenue
generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 67% and 33%,
respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the second quarter of
2022, compared to and 66% and 34%, respectively, in the same period in 2021. The
impact of gross money market fund fee waivers on foreign exchange trading
services was $1 million and $11 million in the three and six months ended June 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $15 million and $23 million in the same periods in
2021, respectively. This represents a reduction in revenue on the Fund Connect
platform due to the impact of fee waivers by participating money market funds,
including State Street Global Advisors funds.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker
through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with
clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly.
These principal market-making activities include transactions for funds
serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds
under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we
are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX
desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades
as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume
and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting
market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other
market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors
on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period. For example,
assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or
bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the
case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX
transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect
FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX”
service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we
continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX
execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds
under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic
FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions
through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions
generate revenue through a “click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which
are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions
charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global
trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money
market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we
refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset
owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer
to as our enhanced custody business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is
composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees
related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on
loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
State Street Corporation | 18
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the
lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the
subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when
the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and
execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we
provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a
significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from
third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody
from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased
2% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same
periods in 2021, primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances,
partially offset by higher spreads.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending
activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards,
interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending
activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our
structured products business.
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2: Total Revenue,
decreased 11% in the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same
period in 2021, primarily driven by lower front office software and data revenue
associated with CRD. Software and processing fees revenue increased 5% in the
six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
Front office software and data revenue, which includes primarily revenue from
CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, decreased 15% in the three
months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
driven by lower on-premises renewals and the absence of episodic fees, partially
offset by higher software-enabled revenues. Front office software and data revenue
increased 8% in the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to
the same period in 2021, primarily driven by higher software-enabled and
professional services revenue, partially offset by lower on-premises renewals and
absence of episodic fees. Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by
CRD is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS, including
professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software
support and maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a
sale of software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when
the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with
the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual
terms. The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the
length of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon
renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of revenue
recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the remaining
balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS related
arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the software, is
recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of
a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided
under the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD
revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units
quarter to quarter.
Lending related and other fees, which decreased by 2% in both the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily
consists of fee revenue associated with our fund finance, leverage loans, municipal
finance, insurance and stable value wrap businesses.
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated
with certain tax-advantaged investments and other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue decreased $53 million and $40 million in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021,
primarily driven by market-related adjustments which negatively impacted other fee
revenue by approximately $39 million and $54 million in the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021.
Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line of Business
Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest
expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same
periods in 2021.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less
interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets,
which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with
banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by
client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total
interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average
interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned
from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a
FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.
NII on an FTE basis increased in the three and six months ended June 30,
2022, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to higher market interest
rates and higher loan balances.
Investment securities net purchase premium amortization, which is included in
interest income, was $66 million and $153 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022, compared to $157 million and $326 million in the same
periods in 2021, respectively, primarily driven by lower prepayments from higher
long-end interest rates.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated
statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the
security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as
purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for
prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities amortizable purchase
premium net of discount accretion for the periods indicated:

the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.21% and 0.07% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 0.02% and 0.03% in the same periods in 2021, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the
components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements within this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $251.25 billion and
$254.66 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to $266.02 billion and $260.41 billion in the same periods in 2021,
respectively. The decreases in both periods are primarily due to lower client deposit
balances.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $76.53 billion and $76.64 billion
in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $99.44
billion and $97.35 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. These deposits
primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the
European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The lower levels of
average cash balances reflect lower client deposit balances and a mix shift into
securities and loans.
Securities repurchased under resale agreements averaged $2.02 billion and
$2.58 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to $3.96 billion and $4.26 billion in the same periods in 2021,
respectively. We maintain an agreement with Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(FICC), a clearing organization that enables us to net securities sold under
repurchase agreements against those repurchased under resale agreements with
counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization, when specific
netting criteria are met. The impact of balance sheet netting increased to $71.10
billion and $126.12 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to $61.59 billion and $74.41 billion in the same periods in
2021, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in FICC repo volumes.
We have been a sponsoring member within FICC since 2005 and continue to
expand our client base as program eligibility parameters broaden. We enter into
repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and
with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities Division
rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their
eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the
prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’
respective obligations. We generally obtain a security interest from our sponsored
clients in the high quality securities collateral that they
receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Average investment securities were $113.93 billion and $116.59 billion in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to
$111.48 billion and $109.66 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. The
increases in both periods reflect higher U.S. Treasuries and agencies, MBS and
CMBS balances, which was primarily driven by a mix shift from interest-bearing
deposits with banks.
Loans averaged $35.83 billion and $35.12 billion in the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $29.47 billion and $28.75 billion in
the same periods in 2021, respectively. Average core loans, which exclude
overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio over the prior year,
averaged $29.28 billion and $29.06 billion in the three and six months ended June
30, 2022, respectively, compared to $25.49 billion and $24.65 billion in the same
periods in 2021, respectively. The increases in both periods are primarily due to
growth in CLOs in loan form and fund finance loans. Additional information about
these loans is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced
custody business, increased to $22.20 billion and $22.98 billion in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, from $20.94 billion and $19.63 billion in
the same periods in 2021, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in the level
of cash collateral posted. Enhanced custody is our securities financing business
where we act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities
finance revenue. The NII earned on these transactions is generally lower than the
interest earned on other alternative investments.
Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits decreased to $177.33 billion
and $180.46 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively,
from $193.52 billion and $186.50 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. While average U.S. deposits decreased in both periods, they remain significantly
higher than pre-pandemic levels and have not yet been significantly impacted by
rising interest rates. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset
servicing business, client deposit behavior and market conditions, including the size
of the Federal Reserve balance sheet and the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S.
interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings decreased to $0.68 billion and
$0.78 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, from
State Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
$0.89 billion and $0.83 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively.
Average long-term debt was $13.70 billion and $13.98 billion in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $13.46 billion and
$13.64 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. These amounts reflect
issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $2.52 billion and $2.70 billion in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $5.68
billion and $5.27 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. Other interestbearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in
connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis
where we have enforceable netting agreements.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume
and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet
management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations
of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the
yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of
credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,
we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities
of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal
agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.
The pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will
depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our
reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses We recorded a $10 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of
2022, reflecting a downward shift in management's economic outlook, partially offset
by a decrease in expected losses related to leveraged loans within our portfolio.
This compares to a $15 million reserve release in the second quarter of 2021.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial Condition" in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.

Compensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 3% in the second
quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower
incentive compensation and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by
higher merit increases and contractor spend. Compensation and employee benefits
expenses decreased 2% in the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and the impact
of currency translation, partially offset by higher merit increases, contractor spend
and seasonal expenses. Currency translation decreased compensation and
employee benefits expenses by 4% and 2% in the three and six months ended June
30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021.
Total headcount increased 3% as of June 30, 2022 compared to June 30,
2021, primarily driven by hiring in global hubs and insourcing of strategic technology
functions from vendors, partially offset by a reduction in high cost locations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Information systems and communications expenses decreased 2% in the
second quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to
episodic credits related to vendor pricing optimization initiatives and infrastructure
rationalization. Information systems and communications expenses was flat in the
six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
Transaction processing services expenses decreased 9% and 5% in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2021, primarily due to lower sub-custody costs.
Occupancy expenses decreased 4% and 9% in the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily
due to footprint optimization and the impact of currency translation. Currency
translation decreased occupancy expenses by 4% and 3% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021.
Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 5% and was flat in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2021, reflecting the impact of currency translation which reduced amortization of
other intangible assets by 3% in both the three and six months ended June 30,
2022, relative to the same periods in 2021.
Other expenses increased 32% and 20% in the three and six months ended
June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily driven
by higher professional services, recoverable client-related expenses and travel
costs.
Acquisition Costs
We recorded approximately $12 million and $21 million of acquisition costs in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, related to our
proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor services business. We expect to incur up
to approximately $590 million of total acquisition and integration costs related to the
acquisition through the third year following its closing. The acquisition is subject to
regulatory reviews and other closing conditions.
We recorded approximately $11 million and $22 million of acquisition costs in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, related to our
acquisition of CRD in 2018. Starting in 2022, we no longer distinguish certain CRD
costs as acquisition costs.

Income tax expense was $88 million and $238 million in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $175 million and $283
million in the same periods in 2021, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 10.5%
and 15.0% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to 18.6% and 18.1% in the same periods in 2021, respectively, primarily
due to higher benefits from the reassessment of a deferred tax asset valuation
allowance.
LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION
Our operations are organized into two lines of business: Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided. The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily
comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial
services industry.
Our Investment Servicing line of business provides a range of services to our
clients. Through State Street Institutional Services, State Street Global Markets,
State Street Digital, and CRD, we provide services for institutional clients, including
mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and
public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations
and endowments worldwide. Our financial services and products allow our large
institutional investor clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis in
markets across the
State Street Corporation | 24
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
globe. As most institutional investors cannot economically or efficiently build their
own technology and operational processes necessary to facilitate their global
securities settlement needs, our primary role as a global trust and custody bank is to
aid our clients to efficiently perform services associated with the clearing, settlement
and execution of securities transactions and related payments.
Products under the Investment Servicing line of business include: back office
products such as custody, accounting, regulatory reporting, investor services,
performance and analytics; middle office products such as IBOR, transaction
management, loans, cash, derivatives and collateral services, record keeping, client
reporting and investment analytics; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading
services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term
investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative
investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance
analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.
Included within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we
acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management System is a
technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional
investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk
analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and
managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in
building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha
platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, analytics and
compliance tools, and advanced data aggregation and integration with other
industry platforms and providers. In 2021, we further expanded our technology
offering with the acquisition of Mercatus, Inc., enabling the launch of Alpha for
Private Markets.
In 2021, we established State Street Digital to focus on the development of
digital assets and technologies, including crypto, central bank digital currency,
blockchain and tokenization, including the evolution of a new integrated business
and digital operating model designed to support our clients' digital investment cycle.
Following consummation of our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor
Services business, the acquired business will be included within our Investment
Servicing line of business. The acquisition is subject to regulatory reviews and other
closing conditions.
We have been engaged in discussions with banking regulators regarding our
proposed
acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business and the related regulatory review
process and potential modifications to the proposed transaction that may facilitate
resolution of that process. Based on those discussions, we have developed with
BBH proposed modifications to the transaction structure may provide a path to
consummating the transaction. The proposed modifications include changes to the
operating model and legal entity structure and changes to the regulatory approvals
required to complete the transaction. As part of the discussions with BBH, State
Street is seeking amendments to the transaction terms, including the purchase
price, given the changes to the planned operating model. Any modification to the
transaction terms would be subject to review and approval by both BBH and our
Board of Directors. We intend during the third quarter to finalize the proposed
structure and contractual terms and confirm our approach with regulators. Assuming
the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications are timely
finalized and contracted, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions,
the parties are aiming to close the transaction at the end of the fourth quarter of
2022. However, there exists significant timing uncertainty and risk that closing will
extend beyond that timeline. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable
modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or outcome of any
regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for that modified transaction.
Absent further agreement of the parties, after September 6, 2022 either party can
terminate the transaction without penalty.
Investment Management, through State Street Global Advisors, provides a
broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our
investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for
equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multiasset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and
alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to
indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions,
including ESG investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global
Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street
Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR ETF brand. While
management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the
investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well,
including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements
related to performance fees.

Servicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 17: Investment Servicing Line of
Business Results, decreased 7% in the three months ended June 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower average equity and
fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, lower client activity and
adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new
business. Currency translation decreased servicing fee revenue by 3% in the
second quarter of 2022, relative to the same period in 2021. Servicing fees
decreased 4% in the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same
period in 2021, primarily due to normal pricing headwinds, lower client activity and
adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new
business. Currency translation decreased servicing fee revenue by 2% in the six
months ended June 30, 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.
For additional information about the impact of worldwide equity and fixedincome valuations, as well as other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to
"Fee Revenue" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 1% and 2% in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in
2021, as expense growth from higher technology infrastructure investments and
merit increases was partially offset by productivity savings, on-going expense
management initiatives and currency translation benefit. Currency translation
decreased expenses for Investment Servicing by 3% and 2% in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, relative to the same periods in 2021.
Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were
$161 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $141 million in the
same period in 2021. Additional information about expenses is provided under

Investment Management total revenue decreased 10% and 3% in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2021.
Management Fees
Management fees decreased 3% in the three months ended June 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower average equity and
fixed income market levels, a client-specific pricing adjustment, and the impact of
currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market
fee waivers and net inflows from ETFs. Currency translation decreased
management fees by 2% in the second quarter of 2022, relative to the same period
in 2021. Management fees increased 1% in the six months ended June 30, 2022
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher average equity market

Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Management decreased 5% and 4% in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2021, primarily due to savings from on-going expense management
initiatives and lower incentive compensation. Currency translation decreased
expenses for Investment Management by 1% in both the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022, relative to the same periods in 2021. Seasonal deferred
incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were $47 million in the six

Additional information about expenses is provided under "Expenses" in
"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and

FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by
the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management
lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine
balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and
short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities
are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are
denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment
alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than
our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek
to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational
in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our
assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and shortduration

financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities
purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the
characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified
portfolio of high-quality assets.
The following information on our financial condition is based on our average
balance sheet, which we believe is the better measure of our balance sheet trends
as period-end balances can be impacted by the timing of client activities including
deposits and withdrawals.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate
and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall
structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global
interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality
investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our
consolidated statement of condition.
During the second quarter of 2022, we completed a number of our previously
announced actions to mitigate additional AOCI risk in the current environment
including a $21.23 billion transfer of securities from AFS to HTM. While these
measures may serve to mitigate additional AOCI risk, we continue to be exposed to
risks associated with sudden or significant AOCI deterioration, particularly in an
environment of continuing significant, and potentially, historic interest rate increases.
There can be no assurance that we will not experience further, potentially material
AOCI deterioration.
Average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 2.8 years and 2.9
years as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Approximately 96% and 92% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated
“AAA” or “AA” as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Approximately 87% and 81% of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S.
debt securities was rated “AAA” or “AA” as of June 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively. The majority of these securities comprised senior positions
within the security structures; these positions have a level of protection provided
through subordination and other forms of credit protection. As of June 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, approximately 26% and 24%, respectively, of the aggregate
carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate.
As of June 30, 2022, our non-U.S. debt securities had an average market-tobook ratio of 97.5%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized loss of $693 million,
composed of gross unrealized gains of $11 million and gross unrealized losses of
$704 million. These unrealized amounts included:
• a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $565 million, composed of gross unrealized
gains of $6 million and gross unrealized losses of $571 million, associated
with non-U.S. AFS debt securities; and
• a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $128 million, composed of gross unrealized
gains of $5 million and gross unrealized losses of $133 million, associated
with non-U.S. HTM debt securities.
As of June 30, 2022, the underlying collateral for non-U.S. MBS and ABS
primarily included Australian, U.K., Netherlands and Italian mortgages. The
securities listed under “Canada” were composed of Canadian government securities
and provincial bonds, corporate debt and non-U.S. agency securities. The securities
listed under “France” were composed of sovereign bonds, corporate debt, covered
bonds, ABS and Non-U.S. agency securities. The securities listed under “Japan”
were substantially composed of Japanese government securities.
Municipal Obligations
We carried approximately $1.03 billion of municipal securities classified as
state and political subdivisions in our investment securities portfolio as of June 30,
2022, as shown in Table 20: Carrying Values of Investment Securities, all of which
were classified as AFS. As of June 30, 2022, we also provided approximately $8.44
billion of credit and liquidity facilities to municipal issuers.

Fund finance loans include primarily $8.17 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.48 billion loans to real money
funds, $4.11 billion collateralized loan obligations in loan form and $1.26 billion loans to business development companies as of
June 30, 2022, compared to $9.15 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.40 billion loans to real money funds,
$2.91 billion collateralized loan obligations in loan form and $1.39 billion loans to business development companies as of
December 31, 2021.
Includes $1.53 billion securities finance loans, $420 million loans to municipalities and $21 million other loans as of June 30,
2022 and $1.78 billion securities finance loans, $455 million loans to municipalities and $23 million other loans as of
December 31, 2021.
As of June 30, 2022, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $25.98 billion and fixed rate loans totaled $2.75 billion. We
have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with LIBOR indexed floating-rate
loans. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data, in our 2021 Form 10-K for additional details.
The increase in foreign loans as of June 30, 2022 compared to December 31,
2021 was primarily driven by higher levels of client overdrafts.
As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our leveraged loans totaled
approximately $3.59 billion and $4.43 billion, respectively. We sold $770 million of
leveraged loans in the second quarter of 2022, of which $155 million remained
unsettled and was held for sale as of June 30, 2022.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 of $53 million and $124 million, respectively, to participate in
syndications of leveraged loans. Additional information about these unfunded
commitments is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our
internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with
approximately 96% and 94%
of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to
larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying
our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our
exposure by counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have
significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying
classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form
10-Q.
No loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both June 30,
2022 and December 31, 2021.

We recorded a $10 million provision for credit losses in both the three and six
months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting a downward shift in management's
economic outlook, partially offset by a decrease in expected losses related to
leveraged loans within our portfolio, compared to a $15 million and $24 million
reserve release in the same periods in 2021, respectively.
As of June 30, 2022, approximately $69 million of our allowance for credit
losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial
segment compared to $74 million as of June 30, 2021. As our view on current and
future economic scenarios changes, our allowance for credit losses related to these
loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit losses,
reflecting credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as changes in management's economic outlook as of year-end. The remaining $45 million and $47 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was related to other loans,
commercial real estate loans, off-balance sheet commitments and other

financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities.
An allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities upon
acquisition of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair value and expected
future cash flows of the investment securities are less than their amortized cost
basis. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of economic and
security-specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by
management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific
performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than management's
expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, the credit-related
component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would be recorded in the
provision for credit losses. Additional information with respect to the allowance for
credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses related to
investment securities, is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border Outstandings
Cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-U.S.
counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-local currency, as
well as non-U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. Our
cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease
financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related
to FX and interest rate contracts; and securities finance. In addition to credit risk,
cross-border outstandings carry the risk that, as a result of political or economic
conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual
repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the
unavailability of, or restrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their
obligations.
As market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit
rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and
sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant
counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we
rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. As a
result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative
ratings volatility.
The cross-border outstandings presented in Table 27: Cross-border
outstandings, represented approximately 29% and 27% of our consolidated total
assets as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Cross-border outstandings included countries in which we do business, and which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated
total assets as of the dates indicated.
As of June 30, 2022, there were no countries whose aggregate cross-border
outstandings amount to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets. As of
December 31, 2021, aggregate cross-border outstandings in France amounted to
between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets, at approximately
$2.83 billion.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a
variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific
to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses on material
risks, which include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risk, funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as
asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest rate
risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.

State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these
risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are
discussed in detail on pages 23 to 51 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our
2021 Form 10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 83 to
88 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading
activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal
securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement
operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central
banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support certain on-balance sheet
credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortized cost. We also maintain
an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our offbalance sheet credit exposure. The two components together represent the
allowance for credit losses. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is
based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and
the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple
economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to
develop management's forecast of future expected losses.
In the second quarter of 2022, our allowance estimate reflected a downward
shift in management's economic outlook, partially offset by a decrease in expected
losses resulting from a reduction in leveraged loan balances within our portfolio.
Allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty
and management
may use qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the
forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2022,
or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent
of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management framework,
including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,
risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring
and controls, refer to pages 88 to 93 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our
activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidity risk
we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and
perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process
involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which
assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in
cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential
impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. We also manage
liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company, as well as at certain
branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has
access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds
market and the Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.
Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily
through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support
agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash
needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. Reference our
SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquid
assets available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company. As of
June 30, 2022, our Parent Company and State
State Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Street Bank had approximately $1.75 billion of senior notes or subordinated
debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management
activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including
interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international
regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance,
supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some
cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII
or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the
way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative
regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a
non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our
efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics, refer to pages 93 to 98 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk
Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity
ratios, including LCR and the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 14 included
under Item 1, Business, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to
improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid
securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. We report LCR to the
Federal Reserve daily. For the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, daily average LCR for the Parent Company was 106% and 105%,
respectively. The impact of higher deposits on the
Parent Company's LCR is offset by a cap, known as the transferability restriction, on
the HQLA from State Street Bank and Trust that can be recognized at the Parent
Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of
liquidity under stress. The average HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR
final rule definition was $141.22 billion and $159.36 billion, post-prescribed haircuts,
for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. For the
quarter ended June 30, 2022, LCR for State Street Bank and Trust was
approximately 122%. State Street Bank and Trust's LCR is higher than the Parent
Company's LCR, primarily due to application of the transferability restriction in the
LCR Final Rule to the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR. This restriction
limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to the amount
of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street Bank and
Trust). This transferability restriction does not apply in the calculation of State Street
Bank and Trust's LCR, and therefore State Street Bank and Trust's LCR reflects the
benefit of all of its HQLA holdings.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements
governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately $72.53 billion at the
Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter ended
June 30, 2022, and $83.48 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The
lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of
client deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without
corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the
FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the
FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against
high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. As of
both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings
from the FHLB.
Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities
is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying
conditions. As of both June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no
outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other
central bank facility.
In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant
amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. These securities are
available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in
our asset liquidity.
State Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $91.34 billion for
the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared to $99.47 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2021.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of
client deposits; drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to
clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan
portfolios; or other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise
under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of
our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post
collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our
enhanced custody program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $32.94 billion and $33.03 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $2.54 billion and $3.24 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of June 30,
2022, approximately 78% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 38% of
our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our commitments
are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual
amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit a
resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution
strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute
on that strategy in the event of major financial distress. Through resolution planning,
we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial
system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019 requires
a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the
relevant submission years. We submitted our updated 2021 targeted 165(d)
resolution plan by July 1, 2021. The targeted resolution plan included the core
elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information about the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on resolution planning. In addition, actions taken
to remediate the 2019 shortcoming related to the implementation of governance
mechanisms were included in the plan. Our next full resolution plan is due July 1,
2023.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred resolution strategy is
the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the
Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company,
SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as
defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available
resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other
entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State
Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary
Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the
recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent
Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a
newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of
the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by
contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,
investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other
cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the
support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent
available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has
agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the
Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent
Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations
and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has
provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may
issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue
to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a
"Recapitalization Event", which is defined under the support agreement as the
earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being
breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for
the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and
SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
State Street Corporation | 35
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be
exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement
that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to
fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF
is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent
Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary
Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that
identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be
made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds
are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and
liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support
that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market
confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement, (which specifically
exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential
bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to
the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and
(4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a
Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support
agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective
or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our
entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. We submitted our last
IDI plan before July 1, 2018. In November 2018, the FDIC had announced that until
the FDIC completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would be
required to be filed. On June 25, 2021, the FDIC issued a policy statement on
resolution plans for IDIs that allows for
content streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a three-year cycle.
State Street Bank’s next IDI plan submission deadline is December 1, 2023.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan to the Federal Reserve.
This plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be
implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress. We also
have recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we
operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody, accounting,
administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset
management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of
these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally
provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place
deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both June 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, approximately 65% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other
currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of
the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by
pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset
Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of
liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold
under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature,
generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.
These balances were $0.95 billion and $1.58 billion as of June 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively.
State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution
of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.09 billion, as of June 30, 2022, to support
its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated
termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of both
June 30, 2022 and
State Street Corporation | 36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
December 31, 2021, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business
needs. In addition, State Street Bank also has current authorization from the Board
to issue unsecured senior debt. The total amount remaining for issuance pursuant
to this authority is $2.15 billion as of June 30, 2022.
On February 7, 2022, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of
1.746% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026, $650 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.203% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2028 and
$550 million aggregate principal amount of 2.623% fixed-to-floating rate senior
notes due 2033.
On March 30, 2022, we redeemed $750 million aggregate principal amount of
2.825% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2023.
On May 13, 2022, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of
4.421% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2033.
On May 15, 2022, we redeemed $750 million aggregate principal amount of
2.653% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2023.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the
maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major
independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit
ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client
deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer
products;
• serving markets; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
A downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets,
which could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden
and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under
securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force
terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral
agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate
the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of
these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by all rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination payments
related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have
been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings
below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as secured
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit
triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Tight labor markets, the ongoing war in Ukraine and lingering impacts from the
COVID-19 pandemic are resulting in stress on the operating environment and have
increased, and may continue to increase, operational risk. The war in Ukraine also
heightens information technology risk exposures, including cyber-threats. See also
“Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages
99 to 102 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in
our 2021 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information
technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology noncompliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents,
business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology
operational events and adoption of new business technologies.

associated risks, refer to pages 102 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Information Technology Risk Management" in our 2021 Form 10-K, and pages 46

or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology
systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations, including the
systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business, such as
resulting from cyber-attacks, could result in significant costs, reputational damage
and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities".
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or assetand-liability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is
provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk
associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate
risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of
which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity
needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against
those factors.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Market
Risk Management" in our 2021 Form 10-K.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into
derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign
exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward
contracts and interest rate futures. As of June 30, 2022, the notional amount of
these
derivative contracts was $2.23 trillion, of which $2.20 trillion was composed of
foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions
closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All
foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,
which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical
confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR,
and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk
requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a
one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to
calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of
continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The
stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in
the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR
meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that
is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial
stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking
the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from
within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial
crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011,
and the market volatility triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. As the
historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future
market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and
methodologies, refer to pages 105 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Valueat-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of
adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing
on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market
conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading
desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC).
Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the CMRC if material. In addition, we have
established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of
estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which
excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions,
changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
We had no back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended June 30, 2022, one back-testing exception in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and no back-testing exceptions in the
quarter ended June 30, 2021. At a 99% confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three
exceptions per year).
The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022
and June 30, 2021, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the
VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

$36 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 and $43 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the average stressed VaR for the quarter ended June 30,
2022, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2022, is primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading
activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction in VaR
measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,
and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.
The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate
risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and
liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic
value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits
generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio
positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our
baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 32, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts
at June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. Our June 30, 2022 baseline forecast broadly aligns to the market’s expectations for a rapid increase in global central bank rates in response to
rising inflation. In addition to higher interest rates, we are also forecasting gradual deposit balance rotation and reductions along with increasing deposit betas as a result of
quantitative tightening and rising interest rates.

In Table 33: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve
relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of
interest rates changes on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change,
for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes gradual deposit balance rotation and
reductions. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.

The short-end is 0-3 months. The long-end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.
As of June 30, 2022, NII from non-U.S. rates is expected to benefit from higher interest rates and is exposed to lower rates. The benefit from higher rates is driven by the
short-end of the yield curve and our deposit beta assumptions in currencies such as EUR and GBP. Compared to June 30, 2021, our non-U.S. benefit to higher interest rates has
increased due to rising ECB rates in our baseline forecast which assumes lower EUR betas once the ECB target rate exceeds 0.25%. Compared to June 30, 2021, our non-U.S.
exposure to lower interest rates has also increased as we begin to realize higher levels of NII from non-U.S. currencies in our baseline forecast.
As of June 30, 2022, our NII sensitivity from U.S. rates is limited in both higher and lower rate shocks and against short and long-end rate changes. This level of U.S. NII
sensitivity is primarily driven by our baseline rate forecast which assumes that the Fed Funds target rises to 3.50% by year-end 2022 and 3.75% by June 2023. Once U.S. short-end
rates reach those levels, the baseline forecast projects significantly higher levels of annual NII and USD deposit betas increase, to the point that the repricing characteristics of our
USD assets and liabilities are substantially aligned. Our scenarios assume that deposit betas are higher than the last U.S. rising rate cycle from 2016-2018 due to our current deposit
mix and greater quantitative tightening this cycle by the Federal Reserve.
As of June 30, 2022, USD NII in the +100bp shock scenario estimates $28 million of NII at risk with the level of Fed Funds reaching 4.75%. Consistent with our interest rate
risk simulation methodology, this estimate assumes no management action is taken to reposition the balance sheet. While this is our standard modeling approach, in a higher and
rising rate environment, management would likely target a neutral asset sensitivity posture by using interest rate swaps and other balance sheet actions.
Compared to June 30, 2021, our reduced benefit to higher rate scenarios is driven by rising deposit betas, expectations for deposit rotation from quantitative tightening and
less investment portfolio reinvestment. USD NII in the -100bp shock scenario estimates a $13 million benefit. Compared to June 30, 2021, our reduced benefit to lower rates is
driven by the higher USD yield curve which is no longer impacted by negative interest rates in the -100bp scenario. The June 30, 2021 sensitivities included a significant NII benefit
from negative rates by charging interest on client deposits and the impacts of contractual floors on loans and securities.
NII sensitivity is routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to Management’s

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry,
with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support
numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models
contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial
management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model
results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect
on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework
seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management framework,
including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 111 to 112 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or
capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of
strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic
risks are influenced by changes in the business environment; decline in market
performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary
impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit,
operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our
assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.
The Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration (IBA), in conjunction
with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), ceased the publication
of GBP, EUR, Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen (JPY) LIBOR settings for all
tenors, as well as one week and two months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on
December 31, 2021. Furthermore, the IBA announced that on June 30, 2023, it
would cease the publication of overnight and twelve months U.S. dollar LIBOR
settings and that as of June 30, 2023 the 1 month, 3 month and 6 month USD
LIBOR setting would become non-representative.
For the one month, three month and six month GBP and JPY settings, the FCA
required in September 2021 that the IBA continue publication of rates on a
synthetic, non-representative basis from year-end 2021 for a period of at least one
year. A decision by the FCA regarding the publication by the IBA of certain USD
LIBOR settings from June 30, 2023 on a synthetic, non-representative basis has not
yet been made and no assumption should be made regarding their availability.
On March 15, 2022, the U.S. Congress adopted, as part of the Consolidated
Appropriation Act of 2022, the Adjustable Interest (LIBOR) Act which provides
certain statutory requirements and guidance for the selection and use of alternative
reference rates in legacy financial contracts governed by U.S. law that do not
provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable alternative reference rate. On
July 19, 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a
notice of proposed rulemaking on a proposed regulation to implement the LIBOR
Act, as required by its terms. The LIBOR Act requires implementing regulations be
in place within 180 days of its enactment.
We have established a process to identify, assess, plan for and remediate the
use of LIBOR and other reference rates affected by reference rate reform that
addresses both direct exposures on our balance sheet, and, more importantly, the
use of LIBOR in our various service provider roles to our customers. This process is
led by a wide, multidisciplinary LIBOR program management office (“LIBOR PMO”),
established in September 2018, that will continue to lead our transition efforts
through June 2023.
The LIBOR PMO reports regularly to executive management of the firm and
our key regulators on progress with respect to the adoption of alternative reference
rates for various financial products and services, client communications, updating of
our quantitative models and information technology systems, managing vendors,
contracts remediation, adoption of alternative reference rates for various financial
products and services, evaluation of fallback provisions contained in LIBOR-priced
loans, investment securities, derivatives and long-term debt and general operational
readiness for each stage of the transition. Most of the work identified by the LIBOR
PMO for implementation of the transition to alternative reference rates is
substantially complete, and contingency plans have been developed with respect to
identified uncertainties.
No incremental material investments are expected to be needed for systems
and processes related to the transition. Potential risks that could impact our
remediation efforts include overall transition readiness across the industry, third
party vendor dependencies and resource constraints from the concentration of
remediation activities at key points in the transition process.
Our direct on balance sheet exposure to LIBOR is limited and primarily
includes assets held in the investment portfolio, certain loans made through Global
Credit Finance and issuances of long-term debt and preferred stock. We have
planned for, and are prepared to, transition our remaining on balance
State Street Corporation | 42
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
sheet exposures in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and the
availability of interim solutions for various legacy LIBOR contracts. We will not
originate or issue new LIBOR-based loans or long-term debt, and any purchases of
LIBOR-based investment securities will be screened for adequate fallback
language. Our remaining exposure outstanding at June 2023 is largely governed by
existing fallback language, or national legislation that provides for appropriate
fallback provisions.
Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition
away from the use of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark in financial instruments
and contracts. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to
market changes promptly, while avoiding increased related expenses or operational
errors.
For additional information about our strategic risk management framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 112 to 113 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Strategic Risk Management", in our 2021 Form 10-K, and page 44 included under
Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K - "The market transition away from
broad use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as an interest rate
benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased
operational, model and financial risk."
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial
flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own
internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by
banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge
above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all
other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to
the required minimum of 3% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any
regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and
discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or
financial holding company, and therefore
some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital, liquidity and other
regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 113 to 121 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market
risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators.
The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital
adequacy: the “standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches", applicable
to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach
prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk
weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches
consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of
RWA related to credit risk, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the
calculation of RWA related to operational risk.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 and the SCB rule enacted
in 2020, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the
assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation
buffer (CCB) and the SCB, for the advanced approaches and standardized
approach, respectively, and a countercyclical capital buffer. In addition, we are
subject to a G-SIB surcharge. Our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory
assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced
approaches and standardized approach.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation
buffer with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and
lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus
planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the
fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement
can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or
surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and
discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The countercyclical capital
buffer is currently set at zero by U.S. banking regulators.
State Street Corporation | 43
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2022, include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach, respectively,
a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the
tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2023, is 1.0%. Based on a calculation as of December 31, 2021, our G-SIB surcharge beginning January 1, 2024 could
increase to 1.5%. Accordingly, we have developed a balance sheet management plan intended to result in a G-SIB surcharge calculation of 1.0% as of December 31, 2022 which, if
effective, would result in our maintaining our current G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% through December 31, 2024.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to
be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by
the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and
quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative and quantitative information
required by the rule is provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. We are subject to the
more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital
adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

 Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk-based deductions.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial
condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory
review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 23, 2022, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2022
supervisory stress test. Our preliminary SCB calculated under the 2022 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will go into effect starting October 1, 2022 and will run through September 30, 2023.

 Not applicable
As of June 30, 2022, total advanced approaches RWA decreased $0.95 billion compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by a decrease in credit risk RWA. The decrease
in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by a net decrease in wholesale investment securities and loans RWA, partially offset by an increase in all other and OTC derivatives RWA.
As of June 30, 2022, total standardized approach RWA increased $3.74 billion compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by an increase in credit risk RWA. The increase
in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by the implementation of SA-CCR, as expected, which was partially offset by lower repo-style transactions RWA.
The regulatory capital ratios as of June 30, 2022, presented in Table 34: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the advanced
approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our
capital and related matters as of June 30, 2022, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively
referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on
Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or
collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events
experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing
regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a
material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.
An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the
severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation
to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us
or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will
change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III
final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a supplementary
leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted
quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the
SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly
average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance
sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company
requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, is intended to improve the
resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced
prudential standards, and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD)
and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a GSIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable counter- cyclical
buffer, which is currently 0%); and
• 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the SLR buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the SLR final rule.
Qualifying external LTD
Greater of:
• 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB surcharge
calculated for these purposes under method 2 of 1.0%);
and
• 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR
final rule.
As of April 1, 2020, the TLAC and LTD requirements calibrated to the SLR
denominator reflect the deduction of certain central bank balances as prescribed by
the regulatory relief implemented under EGRRCPA.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Regulatory Developments
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace
the current 2.0% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB
surcharge. This proposal would also make conforming modifications to our TLAC
and eligible LTD requirements applicable to G-SIBs. At this point in time, it is unclear
whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed.
In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies issued a final rule that, among other things, implemented the standardized
approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), a methodology for calculating the
exposure amount for derivative contracts. Under the final rule, which became
effective on January 1, 2022, we have the option to use the SA-CCR or the Internal
Model Methodology (IMM) to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and
uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation. We
have elected to use the SA-CCR for purposes of our advanced approaches capital
calculations. We are required to determine the amount of these exposures using the
SA-CCR under our standardized approach capital calculation. Additionally, we have
to apply a revised formula to determine the RWA amount of our central counterparty
default fund contributions.
On March 4, 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued the SCB final rule
that replaces, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation buffer
(2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between an institution’s starting and
lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus
planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the
fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. Based on our results
from the 2021 supervisory stress test, our SCB for the period of October 1, 2021
through September 2022 is set at the minimum of 2.5% of RWA.
The Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an
interim final rule effective in March 2020 and later finalized on a permanent basis on
August 26, 2020, which revised the definition of eligible retained income for all U.S.
banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained income makes any
automatic limitations on
capital distributions, where a banking organization's regulatory ratios were to
decline below the respective minimum requirements, take effect on a more gradual
basis.
On March 27, 2020, the BCBS announced the deferral of the implementation
of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023. As of now, the U.S.
federal banking agencies have not formally proposed the implementation of the
BCBS revisions.
Effective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes a deduction for
qualifying central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization’s total
leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial
banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying
central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial
banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping
accounts. For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we deducted $72.4 billion of
average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the
calculation of our SLR, based on this custodial banking deduction.
On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies issued a final rule that requires us and State Street Bank to make certain
deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt
instruments, including eligible LTD under the TLAC rule, issued by the Parent
Company and other U.S. and foreign G-SIBs. The final rule became effective on
April 1, 2021.
Our current SCB requirement is 2.5% for the period from October 1, 2021
through September 30, 2022. On June 23, 2022, we were notified by the Federal
Reserve of the results from the 2022 supervisory stress test. Our preliminary SCB
calculated under the 2022 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5%
minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will go into effect starting October
1, 2022 and will run through September 30, 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to
resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021. We repurchased $475 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our Board authorized a common
share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $425 million of our common stock through June 30, 2021, in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. We
repurchased $425 million of our common stock in the second quarter of 2021. In July 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion
of our common stock through the end of 2022.
In connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business, we did not repurchase any common stock during the last half of 2021, as well as during the
first half of 2022. In June 2022, we announced our intention to resume our common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2022 in an amount reflecting interest rate levels
and market conditions at that time. Additionally, in July 2022, we declared third quarter common stock dividends of $0.63 per share, representing a 10% increase on a per share
basis from both the third quarter 2021 and second quarter of 2022.

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 54 to 56 in "Related
Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in our 2021 Form 10-K,
and to pages 169 to 171 in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration,
timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and
may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction will depend on several factors, including our capital
position and financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions and the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common
share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our
clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of
these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $345.24 billion and
$385.74 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of
the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement
of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the
borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $361.38 billion and $404.12 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of June 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we
indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100%
of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. Of the collateral of $361.38 billion and $404.12 billion, referenced above, $64.18 billion and $61.56 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements
as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We or our agents held $69.17 billion and $67.01 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase
agreements as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, our management carried out an evaluation, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of June 30, 2022.
We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended June 30, 2022, no change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
