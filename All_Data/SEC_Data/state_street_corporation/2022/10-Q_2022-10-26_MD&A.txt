MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is
a financial holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located
at One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111 (telephone
(617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 (Form 10-Q), unless the
context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us,"
"our" or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Parent Company is a
source of financial and managerial strength to our subsidiaries.
Through our subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary,
State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street
Bank, we provide a broad range of financial products and services to
institutional investors worldwide, with $35.69 trillion of AUC/A and
$3.27 trillion of AUM as of September 30, 2022.
As of September 30, 2022, we had consolidated total assets of
$303.57 billion, consolidated total deposits of $238.24 billion,
consolidated total shareholders' equity of $25.65 billion and 41,354
employees. We operate in more than 100 geographic markets
worldwide, including in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East
and Asia.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business,
Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are
defined based on products and services provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in
Line of Business Information in this Management's Discussion and
Analysis and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of the Form
10-Q and updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our
2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2021 previously filed with the SEC (2021 Form 10-K). You should
read the financial information contained in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q in
conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our
2021 Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in
this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period
presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that
materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity,
revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or
complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in
subsequent periods include:
• accounting for fair value measurements;
• allowance for credit losses;
• impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective
or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions
could be subject to revision as new information becomes available.
For additional information about these significant accounting policies
refer to pages 124 to 126, “Significant Accounting Estimates”
included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-
K. We did not change these significant accounting policies in the first
nine months of 2022.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q,
including in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared
on both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis. We
measure and compare certain financial information on a non-GAAP
basis, including information that management uses in evaluating our
business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information should be
considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to,
financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any
non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-Q,
including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled
to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP-basis measure.
We further believe that our presentation of FTE NII, a nonGAAP measure, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest
income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a FTE
basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our
underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank
regulatory standards, including supplemental qualitative and
quantitative information with respect to regulatory capital (including
market risk associated with our trading activities) and the

LCR, summary results of semi-annual State Street-run stress tests
which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan
disclosures required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional
disclosures are accessible on the “Investor Relations” section of our
corporate website at www.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an
inactive textual reference only. Information on our website is not
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business
terms and abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary
following the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials
submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
registration statements filed by us under the Securities Act of 1933,
our annual report to shareholders and other public statements we
may make, may contain statements (including statements in our
Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as
applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of U.S. securities laws, including statements about our
goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital
condition, results of operations, strategies, cost savings and
transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, dividend
and stock purchase programs, acquisitions (including, without
limitation, our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services
business), outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, joint
ventures and divestitures, client growth and new technologies,
services and opportunities, as well as industry, governmental,
regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and
developments, the business environment and other matters that do
not relate strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “anticipate,” "believe", “estimate,”
“expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” "intend," “may,” “objective,”
“outlook,” “plan,” “priority,” “propose,” “seek,” “strategy” "target,"
“trend,” and “will,” or similar statements or variations of such terms,
are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all
forward-looking statements contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and
uncertainties, which change over time, are based on management's
expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made
and are not guarantees of future results. Management's expectations
and assumptions, and the continued validity of the forward-looking
statements, are subject
to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the U.S. and
global economies, regulatory environment and the equity, debt,
currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to
State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors
that could cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on
which forward-looking statements are based cannot be foreseen with
certainty and include, but are not limited to:
Strategic Risks
• The consummation of our proposed acquisition of the BBH
Investor Services business is subject to the receipt of
regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other closing
conditions, the failure or delay of which may prevent or
further delay the consummation of the acquisition;
• We have been engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. and
international banking regulators regarding the prolonged
regulatory review process for our proposed acquisition of
Brown Brothers Harriman’s Investor Services business. The
current regulatory environment for M&A transactions
involving G-SIBs is challenging. We have developed with
BBH proposed modifications to the transaction, including
changes to the operating model and legal entity structure, a
reduction to the purchase price and changes to regulatory
approvals required to consummate the transaction. We
anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat
more complex and include a delay in timing and amount of
deal synergies, resulting in a slower path to accretion. While
discussions with regulators on the proposed modified
transaction are ongoing, the likelihood of a successful
outcome is increasingly uncertain. There can be no
assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction
will be agreed and entered into, or as to the timing or
outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing
conditions for a modified transaction. The modifications to the
transaction remain subject to review and approval by both
BBH’s partners and our Board of Directors. The Sale and
Purchase Agreement allows each of State Street and BBH,
the right to terminate the transaction upon written notice
without a contractual penalty at any time;
• We are subject to intense competition, which could
negatively affect our profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability
in our financial results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and
services, including State Street Digital and State Street
Alpha , and the
SM

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
enhancement of our infrastructure required to meet increased
regulatory and client expectations for resiliency and the
systems and process re-engineering necessary to achieve
improved productivity and reduced operating risk, may take
an extended period to implement, involve costs and expose
us to increased risk;
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to
update and maintain our technology infrastructure;
• The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate certain
risks and uncertainties for our business;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and
divestitures, and the integration, retention and development
of the benefits of our acquisitions, pose risks for our
business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is
intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the
highly skilled people we need to support our business.
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by geopolitical, economic
and market conditions; including, for example, as a result of
the ongoing war in Ukraine, actions taken by central banks to
address inflationary pressures, challenging conditions in
global equity markets, and disruptions in fixed income
markets such as those impacting the UK gilts;
• We have significant International operations, and disruptions
in European and Asian economies could have an adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial
condition and consolidated results of operations could be
adversely affected by changes in the financial markets;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk to counterparties, who may
also have substantial financial dependencies with other
financial institutions, and these credit exposures and
concentrations could expose us to financial loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our
consolidated revenue and is subject to decline based on,
among other factors, market conditions, competition,
currency valuation and investment activities of our clients and
their business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and
liquidity, our consolidated financial condition, capital ratios,
results of operations and business prospects could be
adversely affected;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future,
which may not be available to us or may only be available on
unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an
actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, our
borrowing and capital costs, liquidity and reputation could be
adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common
share repurchases, may be adversely affected by capital and
liquidity standards required as a result of capital stress
testing;
• We face extensive and changing government regulation in
the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our
costs and compliance risks;
• We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of
the resolution of prior regulatory or governmental matters;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government
enforcement and litigation;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we
possess could have an adverse impact on our business and
could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other
adverse effects;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital
ratios depend on data inputs, formulae, models, correlations
and assumptions that are subject to change, which could
materially impact our risk exposures, our total RWA and our
capital ratios from period to period;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our
consolidated financial statements;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our
tax positions and changes in the composition of our pre-tax
earnings may increase our effective tax rate;
• In addition to income tax, we are subject to audit or other
examination, and litigation or other dispute resolution
proceedings, with U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding
State Street Corporation | 6
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
non-income-based tax matters. Our interpretations or
application of tax laws and regulations, including with respect
to withholding, transfer, wage, use, stamp, service and other
non-income taxes, could differ from that of the relevant
governmental taxing authority, or we may experience timing
or other compliance deficiencies in connection with our
efforts to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations,
which could result in the requirement to pay additional taxes,
penalties and/or interest, which could be material; and
• The transition away from LIBOR may result in additional
costs and increased risk exposure.
Operational Risks
• Our control environment may be inadequate, fail or be
circumvented, and operational risks could adversely affect
our consolidated results of operations;
• Cost shifting to non-U.S. jurisdictions and outsourcing may
expose us to increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and
reputational harm and may not result in expected cost
savings;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our information technology
systems or facilities, or those of the third parties with which
we do business, or disruptions to our or their continuous
operations, could result in significant costs, reputational
damage and impacts on our business activities;
• Long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance
risk;
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse
publicity or other reputational harm;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may
contain errors that could result in material harm;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if
our clients incur substantial losses or are restricted in
redeeming their interests in investment pools that we sponsor
or manage;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses to
such risks, could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events
including terrorist attacks,
natural disasters, the emergence of a new pandemic or acts
of embezzlement.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical
financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our other SEC filings.
Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be relied on
as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We
undertake no obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after
the time they are made. The factors discussed herein are not
intended to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties that
may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all developments
that may adversely affect our business or operations or our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions
and should not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate
State Street. Any investor in State Street should consider all risks and
uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our filings under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our annual reports
on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the
Securities Act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's
website at www.sec.gov or on the “Investor Relations” section of our

 Not meaningful
The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section
provides information related to significant events, as well as
highlights of our consolidated financial results for the third quarter of
2022 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial Results. More
detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including
the comparison of our financial results for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021,
is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line of
Business Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as
well as in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. In
this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the
effects of changes in foreign currency translation, those effects are
determined by applying applicable weighted average FX rates from
the relevant 2021 period to the relevant 2022 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Third quarter of 2022 financial performance:
◦ Earnings per share of $1.80 in the third quarter of
2022, decreased 8% compared to $1.96 in the same
period in 2021.
◦ Total fee revenue and total revenue decreased 8%
and 1%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021. Currency
translation contributed 3% to the decrease in both
fee revenue and total revenue in the third quarter of
2022, relative to the same period in 2021.
◦ NII increased 36% in the third quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021.
◦ In the third quarter of 2022, return on equity of 11.2%
decreased from 11.6% in the same period in 2021,
primarily due to a decrease in net income available
to common shareholders. Pre-tax margin of 28.7% in
the third quarter of 2022, decreased from 29.3% in
the same period in 2021, primarily due to a decrease
in total revenue.
◦ Negative operating leverage of 0.7% points in the
third quarter of 2022. Operating leverage represents
the difference between the percentage change in
total revenue and the percentage change in total
expenses, in each case relative to the prior year
period.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
◦ Negative fee operating leverage of 7.9% points in the
third quarter of 2022. Fee operating leverage
represents the difference between the percentage
change in total fee revenue and the percentage
change in total expenses, in each case relative to the
prior year period.
Revenue
• Total revenue decreased 1% in the third quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, as the decrease in
total fee revenue was partially offset by higher NII. Total fee
revenue decreased 8% in the third quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by
lower servicing fees, management fees and other fee
revenue, partially offset by higher foreign exchange trading
services revenue, software and processing fees and
securities finance revenue. Currency translation contributed
3% to the decrease in both total revenue and total fee
revenue in the third quarter of 2022, relative to the same
period in 2021.
• Servicing fee revenue decreased 12% in the third quarter of
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to
lower average market levels, lower client activity and
adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset
by net new business. Currency translation contributed 3% to
the decrease in servicing fee revenue in the third quarter of
2022, relative to the same period in 2021.
• Management fee revenue decreased 10% in the third quarter
of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due
to lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a
previously reported client-specific pricing adjustment and
institutional net outflows, partially offset by the absence of the
impact of money market fee waivers and net inflows from
cash and ETFs. Currency translation contributed 3% to the
decrease in management fee revenue in the third quarter of
2022, relative to the same period in 2021.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue increased 14% in
the third quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in
2021, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads, partially offset
by lower client FX volumes.
• Securities finance revenue increased 4% in the third quarter
of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting
higher spreads, partially offset by lower agency and
enhanced custody balances.
• Software and processing fees revenue increased 2% in the
third quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021,
primarily due to higher front office software and data revenue
associated with CRD, partially offset by lower lending fees.
• Other fee revenue decreased $27 million in the third quarter
of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
driven by the absence of fair value adjustments on equity
investments and negative market-related adjustments.
• NII increased 36% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to
the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher short-term
interest rates from U.S. and international central bank rate
hikes, partially offset by lower client deposits.
Provision for Credit Losses
• We recorded no provision for credit losses in the third quarter
of 2022, compared to a $2 million reserve release in the
same period in 2021, as a downward shift in management's
economic outlook was offset by a reduction in loan portfolio
risk.
Expenses
• Total expenses were flat in the third quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, as continued
productivity and optimization savings were offset by
continued business investments and higher wages,
marketing and travel costs. Currency translation reduced
expenses by 4% in the third quarter of 2022, relative to the
same period in 2021.
Notable items
• The impact of notable items in the third quarter of 2022
includes acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately
$13 million related to our proposed acquisition of the BBH
Investor Services business, which is subject to regulatory
review and other closing conditions.
• The impact of notable items in the third quarter of 2021
includes acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately
$18 million, of which $11 million related to CRD and $7
million related to our proposed acquisition of the BBH
Investor Services business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $35.69 trillion decreased 18% as of September 30,
2022, compared to September 30, 2021, primarily due to
lower market levels, a previously disclosed client transition
and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by new
business installations. In the third quarter of 2022, newly
announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately
$233 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in
future periods totaled approximately $3.41 trillion as of
September 30, 2022.
• AUM of $3.27 trillion decreased 15% as of September 30,
2022, compared to September 30, 2021, primarily due to
lower market levels, institutional net outflows and the impact
of currency translation, partially offset by net inflows from our
ETFs and cash.
Capital
• We declared common stock dividends of $0.63 per share,
totaling $232 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared to
$0.57 per share, totaling $209 million in the same period in
2021.
• In July 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase
program for the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our
common stock through the end of 2022; however, in
connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor
Services business, we did not repurchase any common stock
during the last half of 2021, as well as during the first nine
months of 2022. We intend to repurchase approximately $1.0
billion of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2022
under the existing share repurchase program, expiring
December 21, 2022.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 13.2% as
of September 30, 2022, compared to 14.3% as of December
31, 2021, primarily reflecting lower AOCI related to AFS
securities, largely recognized in the first half of 2022 driven
by the significant increase in interest rates across the yield
curve and the implementation of the standardized approach
for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), partially offset by
planned RWA reductions and optimizations. However, we
anticipate modest RWA increase over the coming quarters as
we efficiently deploy capital to our businesses. Our Tier 1
leverage ratio increased to 6.4% as of September 30, 2022
compared to 6.1% as of December 31, 2021, primarily driven
by lower consolidated average assets, partially offset by
lower
AOCI. During 2022, we completed a number of actions to
mitigate additional AOCI risk in the current environment
including a $21.23 billion transfer of securities from AFS to
HTM. Given the current global economic environment, we
currently expect to operate with CET1 and Tier 1 leverage
capital ratios within our target ranges of 10-11% and 5.25-
5.75%, respectively.
Debt Issuances and Redemptions
• On August 4, 2022, we issued $750 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.164% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes
due 2033.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to
the same periods in 2021, and should be read in conjunction with the

Other fee revenue line item. In addition, we provided a disaggregation of servicing fees into Back office services and Middle office services and of software and processing fees into Front office software and data
and Lending related and other fees. Prior periods were revised to reflect these changes.

Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Servicing and
management fees collectively made up approximately 74% of the total fee revenue in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to 77% and 76% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by
several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our
services. We provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to
collectively as back office services, and middle office services. The nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees
will differ across regions and clients.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market
valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on
asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the valuation process is more
complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party information, AUC/A is reported on a lag, typically onemonth. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end market levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by
approximately 3% on average with a range of 0% to 7% annually and approximately 7% and 2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Table 3: Daily
Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general
market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices
and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those
industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of
September 30, 2022 that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for
which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple
quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of September 30,
2022, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide
equity markets, have a significantly smaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity
and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our
servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are
invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other
considerations. Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee
revenues by approximately 0% on average with a range of (1)% to 2% annually and approximately 0% and 2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See
Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset
types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset
classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee
revenues by approximately 1% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually and approximately 1% and 0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Gross new investment servicing mandates were $233 billion in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.8 trillion per year on average over the past five
years. Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, gross new annual investment servicing mandates ranged from $750 billion to $3.5 trillion.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install
the assets, and the types of assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation
timeline, in general, can range from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years.
Our more complex installations, including new State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With respect to the
current asset mandates of approximately $3.41 trillion that are yet to be installed as of September 30, 2022, we expect the conversion will occur over
the coming 36 months.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing
pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such
pressures today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to
future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the
amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially. On
average, over the five years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate
that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our
servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact
ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year, and approximately (2)%
in both 2021 and 2020. Pricing concessions can be a part of a
contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit
us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client,
expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our
dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the
services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue
generated by anticipated additional services, and the amount of
revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of
pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time
required to onboard those new services, the nature of those services
and client investment practices and other factors. These same
market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win
business from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing
headwinds, we estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new
AUC/A per year; although, notwithstanding increases in AUC/A,
servicing fees remain subject to several factors, including changes in
market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner in which
we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and the
type of services and the other factors described in this Form 10-Q.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we
estimate that approximately 55%, on average, of our servicing fee
revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations
including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another
15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of
activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 30%
of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by
market fluctuations or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset
flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee
revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we
provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations
and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in
our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur,
particularly in periods of higher volatility.
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue,
decreased 12% and 6% in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in
2021, primarily due to lower average market levels, lower client
activity and adjustments and normal pricing headwinds, partially
offset by net new business. Currency translation decreased servicing
fee revenue by 3% in both the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, relative to the same periods in 2021.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately
45% and 46% of total servicing fees in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately
48% in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the third quarter
of 2022 totaled approximately $233 billion. Servicing assets
remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately
$3.41 trillion as of September 30, 2022, which will be reflected in
AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing
fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such
mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional
services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of
definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and
shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. New asset
servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in
future periods exclude certain new business which has been
contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to
publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond
one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be
significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and
reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in
which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and
servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are
presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the
impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent
to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time
to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed
we may provide various services, including back office services such
as custody and safekeeping, transaction processing and trade
settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping,
security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as
investment book of records (IBOR), transaction management, loans,
cash, derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client
reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX
trading services, liquidity solutions, currency and collateral
management, securities finance, and front office services such as
portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis,
performance and attribution, trade order and execution management,
pre-trade compliance and environmental, social and governance
(ESG) investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing
mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and
the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large
asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant
portion of its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more
other providers, pending necessary approvals. We expect to continue
as a significant service provider for
this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be
meaningful to our business. The transition began in 2022, but will
principally occur in 2023 and 2024. For the year ended December 31,
2021, the fee revenue associated with the transitioning assets
represented approximately 1.9% of our total 2021 fee revenue. The
actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a
range of factors, including potential growth in our continuing business
with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM,
which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees
for certain components of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual
funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable
Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM.
Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than
servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying
services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are
dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional
factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a
significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain
management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and
the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect
other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our
relationship pricing for clients. From the second half of 2020 through
the first quarter of 2022, we were in a prolonged low-interest rate
environment, and waived certain fees for our clients for money
market products. Following the Federal Reserve rate hikes in March
and September 2022, money market fee waivers did not have a
significant impact on our management fee revenue in the second and
third quarters of 2022, and we do not expect them to materially
impact the fourth quarter of 2022.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products,
to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally
charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively managed products.
Actively managed products may also include performance fee
arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on
predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's
performance.
State Street Corporation | 15
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2022, and assuming that all other factors remain constant,
including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our
management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over
multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide
equity markets, will have a significantly smaller impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our
management fee revenue. Year-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and
Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and
classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can
therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.
Management fees decreased 10% and 3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to same periods in
2021, primarily due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously reported client-specific pricing adjustment and institutional
net outflows, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and net inflows from cash and ETFs. Currency translation
decreased management fees by 3% and 2% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, relative to the same periods in
2021.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 25% and 26% of total management fees in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to approximately 26% in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in
Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 14% and 11% in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to
the same periods in 2021, primarily due to higher FX spreads,
partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Foreign exchange trading
services revenue comprises revenue generated by FX trading and
revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which
made up 65% and 35%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading
services revenue in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 66% and
34%, respectively, in the same period in 2021. The impact of gross
money market fund fee waivers on foreign exchange trading services
was $1 million and $12 million in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $15 million and
$38 million in the same periods in 2021, respectively. This represents
a reduction in revenue on the Fund Connect platform due to the
impact of fee waivers by participating money market funds, including
State Street Global Advisors funds.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal
market-maker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX
trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at
negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that
contact our trading desk directly. These principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by
third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those
funds under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients,
for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment
managers, routed to our FX desk through our asset-servicing
operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at
rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors,
including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related
spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our
management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks
associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors
on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period.
For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases
or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend
to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in clientrelated FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to
executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us,
transition from indirect
FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our
“Street FX” service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms.
Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker,
enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and
automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under
custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue
through "electronic FX services" and "other trading, transition
management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute
FX transactions through one of our electronic trading
platforms. These transactions generate revenue through a
“click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage
revenue: As our clients look to us to enhance and preserve
portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or
Currency Management capabilities or transact with our
Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which are
not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via
commissions charged for trades transacted during the
management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms:
it is a global trading, analytics and cash management tool with
access to more than 400 money market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors
managed investment funds with a broad range of investment
objectives, which we refer to as the State Street Global
Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment
managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency
lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal,
which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending
activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related
to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is
principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest
rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
State Street Corporation | 18
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities
from the lending client or other market participants and then lends
such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a
broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending client is unable
to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the
transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we
provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we
source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our
role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source
securities through assets under custody from clients who have
designated us as an eligible borrower.
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total
Revenue, increased 4% in the three months ended September 30,
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by
higher spreads, partially offset by lower agency and enhanced
custody balances. Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table
2: Total Revenue, was flat in the nine months ended September 30,
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, as higher spreads were
offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for
securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the
profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. In
addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including
revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of
those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities,
may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our
agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our
securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in
future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of
fees and revenue, including fees from software licensing and
maintenance and fees from our structured products business.
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2:
Total Revenue, increased 2% in the three months ended September
30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by
higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD,
partially offset by lower lending related and other fees. Software and
processing fees revenue increased 4% in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated
with CRD, partially offset by lower lending related and other fees.
Front office software and data revenue, which includes primarily
revenue from CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services,
increased 9% in the three months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by higher
software-enabled revenue related to new client implementations and
continued SaaS client conversions. Front office software and data
revenue increased 9% in the nine months ended September 30,
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by
higher software-enabled and professional services revenue, partially
offset by lower on-premises renewals. Revenue related to the front
office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of
term software licenses and SaaS, including professional services
such as consulting and implementation services, software support
and maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated
with a sale of software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a
point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to
and use of the software license, with the percentage varying based
on the length of the contract and other contractual terms. The
remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over
the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are
provided. Upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the
same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70%
recognized upon renewal and the remaining balance recognized over
the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement,
where the customer does not take possession of the software, is
recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided.
Upon renewal of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be
recognized as services are provided under the new contract. As a
result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are
accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business
units quarter to quarter.
Lending related and other fees, which decreased 11% and 5%
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily
consists of fee revenue associated with our fund finance, leverage
loans, municipal finance, insurance and stable value wrap
businesses.
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and
income associated with certain tax-advantaged investments and
other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue decreased $27 million in the three months
ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021,
primarily driven by the absence of fair value adjustments on equity
State Street Corporation | 19
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
investments of $17 million, and market-related adjustments which
negatively impacted other fee revenue by $9 million compared to the
same period in 2021.
Other fee revenue decreased $67 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021,
primarily driven by market-related adjustments which negatively
impacted other fee revenue by approximately $64 million compared
to the same period in 2021, partially offset by larger fair value
adjustments on equity investments of $27 million compared to the
same period in 2021.
Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line
of Business Information" included in this Management's Discussion
and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income
and interest expense for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning
assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities.
Interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment
securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, loans, resale
agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client
deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII
and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is
calculated by dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets.
Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from
certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is
adjusted to a FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory
income tax rates.
NII on an FTE basis increased in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same periods in 2021,
primarily due to higher short-term interest rates from U.S. and
international central bank rate hikes, partially offset by lower client
deposits.
Investment securities net purchase premium amortization, which
is included in interest income, was $46 million and $199 million for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to $128 million and $454 million in the same periods in
2021, respectively, primarily driven by lower prepayments from higher
long-end interest rates.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our
consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method,
or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual
or estimated life of the security. The rate of return considers any nonrefundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts,
resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. The amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments
when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities
amortizable purchase premium net of discount accretion for the
periods indicated:

billion for the same periods in 2021, respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.31% and 0.21% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to 0.05% and
0.04% in the same periods in 2021, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below.
Additional information about the components of interest income and
interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements within this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $235.91 billion and
$248.34 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $254.50 billion and $258.42 billion in
the same periods in 2021, respectively. The decreases in both
periods are primarily due to lower client deposit balances.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $68.92 billion
and $74.03 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $79.38 billion and $91.29 billion in
the same periods in 2021, respectively. These deposits primarily
reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the
European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The
lower levels of average cash balances reflect lower client deposit
balances.
Securities repurchased under resale agreements averaged
$1.47 billion and $2.21 billion in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $4.06 billion and
$4.19 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. As a member
of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), we may net
securities sold under repurchase agreements against those
repurchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are
also members of the clearing organization, when specific netting
criteria are met. The impact of balance sheet netting increased to
$72.74 billion and $66.35 billion in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to $52.17 billion and
$66.92 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively, primarily
driven by an increase in FICC repo volumes.
We are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a
sponsoring member within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale
transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with
other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities
Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may
sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with
FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full
payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’
respective obligations. We generally obtain a security interest from
our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they
receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may be required to pay a
pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide
liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the
extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the
prescribed loss allocation to FICC is depleted. It is difficult to estimate
State Street’s maximum possible exposure under its membership
agreement, since this would require an assessment of future claims
that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. At
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we did not record any
liabilities under these arrangements.
Average investment securities were $108.88 billion and
$113.99 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $113.64 billion and $111.00 billion in
the same periods in 2021, respectively. The decrease in the three
months relative to prior year was driven by a reduction in creditsensitive assets, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Treasuries and
agencies, MBS and CMBS balances. The increase in the nine
months relative to prior year was driven by growth in U.S. Treasuries,
MBS and CMBS balances, partially offset by a reduction in creditsensitive assets.
Loans averaged $35.07 billion and $35.10 billion in the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared
to $32.04 billion and $29.86 billion in the same periods in 2021,
respectively. Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts and
highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio over the prior year,
averaged $29.31 billion and $29.14 billion in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to
$28.41 billion and $25.92 billion in the same periods in 2021,
respectively. The increases in both periods are primarily due to
growth in CLOs in loan form and consumer real estate loans, partially
offset by a decline in leveraged loans. Additional information about
these loans is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with
our enhanced custody business, averaged $20.88 billion and
$22.27 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $24.66 billion and $21.32 billion in
the same periods in 2021, respectively. The change in both periods is
primarily driven by the levels of cash collateral posted. Enhanced
custody is our securities financing business where we act as principal
with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance
revenue. The NII earned on these transactions is generally lower
than the interest earned on other alternative investments.
State Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits decreased to
$166.84 billion and $175.87 billion in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022, respectively, from $186.81 billion and
$186.60 billion in the same periods in 2021, respectively. While
average deposits decreased in both periods, they remain significantly
higher than pre-pandemic levels. The decrease is driven by higher
market rates and the impact of quantitative tightening, currency
translation and equity market declines. Future deposit levels will be
influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit
behavior and market conditions, including the size of the Federal
Reserve balance sheet and the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S.
interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings decreased to $0.43 billion
and $0.66 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, from $0.84 billion and $0.83 billion in the same
periods in 2021, respectively.
Average long-term debt was $13.96 billion and $13.97 billion in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to $13.02 billion and $13.43 billion in the same periods in
2021, respectively. These amounts reflect issuances, redemptions
and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $2.54 billion and
$2.64 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $5.46 billion and $5.33 billion in the
same periods in 2021, respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities
primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in
connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented
on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM,
including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources;
central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes
in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or
proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of
those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased
compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured; and
changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including
regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the
proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in
highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal agency
MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency
securities. The pace at which we reinvest
and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the
impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other
factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global
interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of
NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
We recorded no provision for credit losses in the third quarter of
2022, as a downward shift in management's economic outlook was
offset by a reduction in loan portfolio risk. This compares to a
$2 million reserve release in the third quarter of 2021.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial
Condition" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note
4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
increases. Compensation and employee benefits expenses
decreased 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower
incentive compensation and the impact of currency translation,
partially offset by higher headcount, merit increases, contractor
spend and seasonal expenses. Currency translation decreased
compensation and employee benefits expenses by 4% and 3% in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2021.
Total headcount increased 6% as of September 30, 2022
compared to September 30, 2021, primarily driven by hiring in global
hubs and insourcing of strategic technology functions from vendors,
partially offset by a reduction in high cost locations.
Information systems and communications expenses decreased
2% and 1% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to
productivity and vendor savings initiatives, partially offset by
technology and infrastructure investments.
Transaction processing services expenses decreased 10% and
7% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to
lower sub-custody costs and the impact of currency translation which
reduced transaction processing services expenses by 2% and 3% in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2021.
Occupancy expenses decreased 5% and 7% in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to
the same periods in 2021, primarily due to footprint optimization and
the impact of currency translation which reduced occupancy
expenses by 6% and 3% in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in
2021.
Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 6% and 2% in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2021, reflecting the impact of
currency translation which reduced amortization of other intangible
assets by 4% and 3% in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in
2021.
Other expenses increased 24% in the three months ended
September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
due to higher marketing expenses, travel costs and State Street
Foundation funding. Other expenses increased 21% in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the same period in
2021, primarily due to higher professional services, recoverable
clientrelated expenses, marketing expenses, travel and securities
processing costs.
Acquisition Costs
We recorded approximately $13 million and $34 million of
acquisition costs in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, respectively, compared to $7 million in each of the same
periods in 2021 related to our proposed acquisition of the BBH
Investor services business. We expect to incur up to approximately
$590 million of acquisition and integration costs related to the
acquisition through the third year following its closing. We anticipate
that, should we finalize and agree with BBH upon the presently
contemplated proposed modifications to the transaction, we would
incur additional acquisition and integration costs in subsequent years.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory reviews and other closing
conditions. For additional information on the BBH acquisition, refer to
"Line of Business Information" included in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
We recorded approximately $11 million and $33 million of
acquisition costs in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2021, respectively, related to our 2018 acquisition of CRD. Starting in
2022, we no longer distinguish certain CRD costs as acquisition
costs.

Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $159 million and $397 million in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to $162 million and $445 million in the same periods in
2021. Our effective tax rate was 18.7% and 16.3% in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to
18.5% and 18.2% in the same periods in 2021. The decrease in the
nine month period was primarily due to higher benefits from the
reassessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION
Our operations are organized into two lines of business:
Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are
defined based on products and services provided. The results of
operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable
with those of other companies, including companies in the financial
services industry.
Our Investment Servicing line of business provides a range of
services to our clients. Through State Street Investment Services,
State Street Global Markets, State Street Digital, and State Street
Alpha, we provide services for institutional clients, including mutual
funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools,
corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies,
investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide. Our
financial services and products allow our large institutional investor
clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis in markets
across the globe. As most institutional investors cannot economically
or efficiently build their own technology and operational processes
necessary to facilitate their global securities settlement needs, our
primary role as a global trust and custody bank is to aid our clients to
efficiently perform services associated with the clearing, settlement
and execution of securities transactions and related payments.
Products under the Investment Servicing line of business
include: back office products such as custody, accounting, regulatory
reporting, investor services, performance and analytics; middle office
products such as IBOR, transaction management, loans, cash,
derivatives and collateral services, record keeping, client reporting
and investment analytics; foreign exchange, brokerage and other
trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products;
deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease
financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager
operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics;
and financial data management to support institutional investors.
With the acquisition of CRD in 2018, we took the first step in
building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. The Charles
River Investment Management Solution is a technology offering
which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional
investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management
and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with
integrated compliance and managed data throughout. Today our
State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading
and execution, analytics and compliance tools, and advanced data
aggregation and integration with other industry platforms and
providers. In 2021, we further expanded State Street Alpha's
technology offering with the acquisition of Mercatus, Inc., enabling
the launch of Alpha for Private Markets.
In 2021, we established State Street Digital to focus on the
development of digital assets and technologies, including crypto,
central bank digital currency, blockchain and tokenization, including
the evolution of a new integrated business and digital operating
model designed to support our clients' digital investment cycle.
Following consummation of our proposed acquisition of the BBH
Investor Services business, the acquired business would be included
within our Investment Servicing line of business.
We have been engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. and
international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory
review process for our proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers
Harriman’s Investor Services business. The current regulatory
environment for M&A transactions involving G-SIBs is challenging.
We have developed with BBH proposed modifications to the
transaction, including changes to the operating model and legal entity
structure, a reduction to the purchase price and changes to
regulatory approvals required to consummate the transaction. We
anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat more
complex and include a delay in timing and amount of deal synergies,
resulting in a slower path to accretion. While discussions with
regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing, the
likelihood of a successful outcome is increasingly uncertain. There
can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction
will be agreed and entered into, or as to the timing or outcome of any
regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for a modified
transaction. The modifications to the transaction remain subject to
review and approval by both BBH’s partners and our Board of
Directors. The Sale and Purchase Agreement allows each of State
Street and BBH, the right to terminate the transaction upon written
notice without a contractual penalty at any time.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Investment Management, through State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for
our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including
core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our
AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including ESG investing,
defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors
is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR ETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the
investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management
agreements related to performance fees.
For information about our two lines of business, as well as the revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies associated with them,

Servicing fees, as presented in Table 17: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, decreased 12% and 6% in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to lower average market levels, lower client activity
and adjustments and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Currency translation decreased servicing fee revenue by 3% in
both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, relative to the same periods in 2021.

Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing were flat and increased 1% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2021, as expense growth from higher technology infrastructure investments, higher headcount and merit increases
was offset or partially offset by productivity savings, on-going expense management initiatives and the benefit of currency translation which reduced
expenses for Investment Servicing by 4% and 3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, relative to the same periods
in 2021. Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were $143 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022

Investment Management total revenue decreased 9% and 5% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared
to the same periods in 2021.
Management Fees
Management fees decreased 10% and 3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to the same
periods in 2021, primarily due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously reported client-specific pricing adjustment and
institutional net outflows, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and net inflows from cash and ETFs. Currency
translation decreased management fees by 3% and 2% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, relative to the same
periods in 2021.

Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Management decreased 1% and
3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2021, as savings from
on-going expense management initiatives was partially offset by merit
increases. Currency translation reduced expenses for Investment
Management by 3% and 2% in the three and nine months ended

Additional information about expenses is provided under
"Expenses" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this

FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is
primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment
Servicing and Investment Management lines of business. Our clients'
needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume,
mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize
deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of
our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of interestbearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a
variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term
investment alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated
transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual
maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we
evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain
appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not
operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our
operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in
our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments,
such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities
purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is
determined by the characteristics of the client
liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of highquality assets.
The following information on our financial condition is based on
our average balance sheet, which we believe is the better measure of
our balance sheet trends as period-end balances can be impacted by
the timing of client activities including deposits and withdrawals.

Primarily comprised of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to at least 97% of
defaulted principal and accrued interest on the underlying loans.
Excludes collateralized loan obligations in loan form. Refer to Note 4 for additional information.
Consists entirely of non-agency CMBS as of both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value of U.S. corporate bonds was
$0.99 billion and $2.44 billion, respectively.
An immaterial amount of accrued interest related to HTM and AFS investment securities was excluded
from the amortized cost basis for the period ended September 30, 2022.
Approximately $21.23 billion was transferred from AFS to HTM securities in the second quarter of 2022.
As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the total amortized cost included $239 million and
$292 million, respectively, of non-agency CMBS and $10 million and $14 million of non-agency RMBS,
respectively.
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio
is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the
interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in
the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of
condition, in consideration of the global interest rate environment. We
consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities
portfolio to be an important element in the management of our
consolidated statement of condition.
During 2022, we completed a number of actions to mitigate
additional AOCI risk in the current environment including a
$21.23 billion transfer of securities from AFS to HTM. While these
measures may serve to mitigate additional AOCI risk, we continue to
be exposed to risks associated with sudden or significant AOCI
deterioration, particularly in an environment of continuing significant,
and potentially, historic interest rate increases. There can be no
assurance that we will not experience further, potentially material
AOCI deterioration.

As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately
26% and 24%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of these
non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate.
As of September 30, 2022, our non-U.S. debt securities had an
average market-to-book ratio of
96.3%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized loss of $963 million,
composed of gross unrealized gains of $2 million and gross
unrealized losses of $965 million. These unrealized amounts
included:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our aggregate municipal securities exposure presented in Table
24: State and Municipal Obligors, was concentrated primarily with
highly-rated counterparties, with approximately 89% of the obligors
rated “AAA” or “AA” as of September 30, 2022. As of that date,
approximately 30% and 69% of our aggregate municipal securities
exposure was associated with general obligation and revenue bonds,
respectively. The portfolios are also diversified geographically, with
the states that represent our largest exposures widely dispersed
across the U.S.

Includes $1.73 billion securities finance loans, $389 million loans to municipalities and $19 million other
loans as of September 30, 2022 and $1.78 billion securities finance loans, $455 million loans to
municipalities and $23 million other loans as of December 31, 2021.
As of September 30, 2022, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $26.05 billion and fixed rate
loans totaled $2.90 billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted
cash flows associated with LIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2021
Form 10-K for additional details.
The increase in foreign loans as of September 30, 2022
compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by higher
levels of client overdrafts.
As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our
leveraged loans totaled approximately $3.35 billion and $4.43 billion,
respectively. We sold
$21 million of leveraged loans in the third quarter of 2022.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 of $187 million and
$124 million, respectively, to participate in syndications of leveraged
loans. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is
provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative”
under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally
rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with approximately 97% and 94% of the
loans rated “BB” or “B” as of September 30, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting
our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major
global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis
process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure
by counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have
significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in
our portfolio.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as
underlying classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
No loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings as of
both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As of September 30, 2022, approximately $75 million of our
allowance for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in
the commercial and financial segment compared to $68 million as of
September 30, 2021. As our view on current and future economic
scenarios changes, our allowance for credit losses related to these
loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit
losses, reflecting credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as
changes in management's economic outlook as of year-end. The
remaining $39 million and $49 million as of September 30, 2022 and
2021, respectively, was related to other loans, commercial real estate
loans, off-balance sheet commitments and other financial assets held
at amortized cost, including investment securities.
An allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities
upon acquisition of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair
value and expected future cash flows of the investment securities are
less than their amortized cost basis. Our assessment of impairment
involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors.
Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which
contemplate current market conditions and security-specific
performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than
management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond
performance, the credit-related component of impairment, in
particular, could increase and would be recorded in the provision for
credit losses. Additional information with respect to the allowance for
credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses
related to investment securities, is provided in Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border Outstandings
Cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by nonU.S. counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other
non-local currency, as well as non-U.S. local currency claims not
funded by local currency liabilities. Our cross-border outstandings
consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing,
including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts
related to FX and interest rate contracts; and securities finance. In
addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings carry the risk that,
as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers
may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of
principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or
restrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.
As market and economic conditions change, the major
independent credit rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and nonU.S. financial institutions
and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be,
significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve
as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and
may do so again in the future. As a result, we may be exposed to
increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.
The cross-border outstandings presented in Table 27: Crossborder outstandings, represented approximately 34% and 27% of our
consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively.

As of September 30, 2022, there were no countries whose
aggregate cross-border outstandings amounted to between 0.75%
and 1% of our consolidated assets. As of December 31, 2021,
aggregate cross-border outstandings in France amounted to between
0.75% and 1% of our consolidated total assets, at approximately
$2.83 billion.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our global business activities, we are
exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services
industry, others more specific to our business activities. Our risk
management framework focuses on material risks, which include the
following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risk, funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
(1)
(1)
State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which
we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which
consists primarily of interest rate risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each
of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated
financial statements, are discussed in detail on pages 23 to 51
included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including
our risk appetite framework and risk governance committee structure,
refer to pages 83 to 88 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, Risk Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a
counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a
counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or
settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms.
We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities,
such as overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our
investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty
exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as
securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal securities
lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other
settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other
cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions and
fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support certain
on-balance sheet credit exposures, including financial assets held at
amortized cost. We also maintain an allowance for unfunded
commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance sheet
credit exposure. The two components together represent the
allowance for credit losses. Review and evaluation of the adequacy
of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but
occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our
evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the estimated effects
of our
forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple economic
scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios,
to develop management's forecast of future expected losses.
In the third quarter of 2022, our allowance estimate reflected a
downward shift in management's economic outlook, which was offset
by a reduction in loan portfolio risk. Allowance estimates remain
subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and
management may use qualitative adjustments. If future data and
forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our
allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2022, or if credit risk
migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent
of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also
change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is
provided in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in
this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management
framework, including our core policies and principles, structure and
organization, credit ratings, risk parameter estimates, credit risk
mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring and controls, refer to
pages 88 to 93 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk
based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related
factors. In managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain
established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine
stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process
involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external
scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in
identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in
available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our
ability to access the global capital markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. We
also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company,
as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank.
State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding
sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the
Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower
market access. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or
has direct access to, primarily through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the
Parent Company, and the support agreement, as discussed in the
"Uses of Liquidity" section of this
State Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management's Discussion and Analysis, enough cash to meet its
current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected
over the next one-year period. Reference our SPOE Strategy as
discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at the Parent
Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be available
to the Parent Company. As of September 30, 2022, our Parent
Company and State Street Bank had approximately $1.01 billion of
senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature
in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk
management activities are subject to heightened and evolving
regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those
requirements, under specific U.S. and international regulations and
also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory
activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements
could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our
investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of
certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we
deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive
negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan
deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or
otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our efforts to satisfy,
or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as
well as liquidity metrics, refer to pages 93 to 98 included under Item
7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk Management, in our 2021 Form
10-K. For additional information on our liquidity ratios, including LCR
and the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 14 included under Item
1, Business, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity,
which consists primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid
assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. As a banking
organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the LCR rule
approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to
promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking
organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to
absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day
period and improve the measurement and
management of liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s
HQLA against its net cash outflows. HQLA primarily consists of
unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that
qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. We report LCR to the
Federal Reserve daily. For the quarters ended September 30, 2022
and December 31, 2021, daily average LCR for the Parent Company
was 106% and 105%, respectively. The impact of higher deposits on
the Parent Company's LCR is offset by a cap, known as the
transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street Bank and
Trust that can be recognized at the Parent Company as defined in
the U.S. LCR Final Rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of liquidity
under stress. The average HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the
Parent Company under the LCR final rule definition was $130.55
billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2022 compared to
$159.36 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, primarily
due to a decrease in client deposits relative to the prior period. For
the quarter ended September 30, 2022, LCR for State Street Bank
and Trust was approximately 116%. State Street Bank and Trust's
LCR is higher than the Parent Company's LCR, primarily due to
application of the transferability restriction in the LCR Final Rule to
the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR. This restriction limits
the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to
the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary
(State Street Bank and Trust). This transferability restriction does not
apply in the calculation of State Street Bank and Trust's LCR, and
therefore State Street Bank and Trust's LCR reflects the benefit of all
of its HQLA holdings.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory
requirements governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of
approximately $65.13 billion at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and
other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter ended September 30,
2022, and $83.48 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
The lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect
lower levels of client deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities
pledged without corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston (FRBB), the FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks.
State Street Bank is a member of the FHLB. This membership allows
for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality
collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. As of
both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no
outstanding borrowings from the FHLB.
Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by
these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with
utilization subject to
State Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
underlying conditions. As of both September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding primary credit
borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other central bank
facility.
In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we
have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment
securities. These securities are available sources of liquidity,
although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset
liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was
$85.16 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared
to $99.47 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following:
withdrawals of client deposits; drawdowns by our custody clients of
lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions;
increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other permitted
purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress
conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of
our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment
portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources
of securities under our enhanced custody program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross
contractual amounts totaling $31.53 billion and $33.03 billion and
standby letters of credit totaling $2.16 billion and $3.24 billion as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. These
amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of
September 30, 2022, approximately 76% of our unfunded
commitments to extend credit and 26% of our standby letters of credit
expire within one year. Since many of our commitments are expected
to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual
amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to
submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC (the Agencies). The purpose of our resolution
plan is to describe our preferred resolution strategy and to
demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute
on that strategy in the event of major financial distress. Through
resolution planning, we seek to maintain our role as a key
infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing
risk to the financial system.
The final rule published in the Federal Register on November 1,
2019 requires a full resolution plan
and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant
submission years. We submitted our updated 2021 targeted 165(d)
resolution plan by July 1, 2021. The targeted resolution plan included
the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level
information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
resolution planning. In addition, actions taken to remediate the 2019
shortcoming related to the implementation of governance
mechanisms were included in the plan.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred
resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy
provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the Parent Company and
pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF
(a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities
(as defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated,
up to its available resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to
State Street Bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital
and/or liquidity support (collectively with State Street Bank,
“Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the
Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution
proceedings. Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity
to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a
bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The
Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to
a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for
the benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has prefunded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid
assets, cash deposits, investments in intercompany debt,
investments in marketable securities and other cash and non-cash
equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the support
agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent
available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these
contributions, SSIF has agreed in the support agreement to provide
capital and liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the
Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company’s capital
and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its
upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a
potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has provided the Parent
Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may issue)
one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent
Company Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the
Parent Company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the
period prior to the occurrence of a "Recapitalization Event", which is
defined under the
State Street Corporation | 35
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
support agreement as the earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more
capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or (2) the
authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the
Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of
resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement
the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations
outstanding under the Parent Company Funding Notes would
automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to
SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company and SSIF under the
support agreement are secured through a security agreement that
grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would
use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the
Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the
Parent Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on
an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank
and our other Beneficiary Entities. To support this process, we have
established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would
need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain
events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds are
set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital
and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary
government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a
stabilized institution with market confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF
would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent
Company; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contribute to
SSIF any remaining assets it is required to contribute to SSIF under
the support agreement, (which specifically exclude amounts
designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy
proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and
liquidity support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’
continued operation to the extent of its available resources and
consistent with the support agreement; and (4) the Parent Company
would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or
remaining a Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support
pursuant to the support agreement, including in evaluating any of our
entities from a creditor's perspective or determining whether to enter
into a contractual relationship with any of our entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the
FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an
IDI plan. We submitted our last IDI plan before July 1, 2018. In
November 2018, the FDIC had announced that until the FDIC
completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would
be required to be filed. On June 25, 2021, the FDIC issued a policy
statement on resolution plans for IDIs that allows for content
streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a three-year
cycle.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan to the
Federal Reserve. This plan includes detailed governance triggers and
contingency actions that can be implemented in a timely manner in
the event of extreme financial distress. We also have recovery
planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we
operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody,
accounting, administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash
management, financial asset management, securities finance and
investment advisory services. As a provider of these products and
services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided
a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients
place deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately 65% of
our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars,
15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral
component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets
provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more
importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging
the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability
to source incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed
earlier under “Asset Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the
FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities
lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are
short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by
high-quality investment securities. These balances were $4.25 billion
and $1.58 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively.
State Street Corporation | 36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a
financial institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.02
billion, as of September 30, 2022, to support its Canadian securities
processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination
date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of both
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was no balance
outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our
current universal shelf registration statement to meet current
commitments and business needs. In addition, State Street Bank also
has current authorization from the Board to issue unsecured senior
debt. The total amount remaining for issuance pursuant to this
authority is $2.15 billion as of September 30, 2022.
On February 7, 2022, we issued $300 million aggregate
principal amount of 1.746% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due
2026, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 2.203% fixed-tofloating rate senior notes due 2028 and $550 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.623% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due
2033.
On March 30, 2022, we redeemed $750 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.825% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due
2023.
On May 13, 2022, we issued $500 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.421% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2033.
On May 15, 2022, we redeemed $750 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.653% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due
2023.
On August 4, 2022, we issued $750 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.164% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2033.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered
by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by
the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to
maintaining high credit ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets
and client deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving
our ability to offer products;
• serving markets; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit
ratings.
A downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a
material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to
access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of
funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale
withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger
requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require
additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative
contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into
under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to
post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our
credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by
determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by all rating agencies. The additional collateral or
termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under
these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in
the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified
in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for
which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems or from external
events.
Tight labor markets, challenging conditions in the global equity
and fixed income markets, and heightened geopolitical tensions,
including the ongoing war in Ukraine, are resulting in stress on the
operating environment and have increased, and may continue to
increase, operational risk. The war in Ukraine may also heighten
information technology risk exposures, including cyber-threats. See
also “Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework,

Operations,

"Operational Risk Management", in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated
with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and
adoption of information technology. Information technology risk
includes risks triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory
obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business
disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology
operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk
framework and associated risks, refer to pages 102 to 103 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, "Information Technology Risk
Management" in our 2021 Form 10-K, and pages 46 to 47 included
under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K - "Any failures of
or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information
technology systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous
operations, including the systems, facilities or operations of third
parties with which we do business, such as resulting from cyberattacks, could result in significant costs, reputational damage and
limits on our ability to conduct our business activities".
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of
loss that could result from broad market movements, such as
changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign
exchange rates or commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk
in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-andliability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities is provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information
about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which
consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under “Assetand-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk,
the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business
objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market
volatility and our execution against those factors.
For additional information about the market risk associated with
our trading activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7,
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Market Risk Management" in our 2021 Form
10-K.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the
foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling
cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including
foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest
rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts
and interest rate futures. As of September 30, 2022, the notional
amount of these derivative contracts was $2.09 trillion, of which $2.06
trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot
contracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of
mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange
contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies,
including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given
period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk
measurement methodology to measure trading-related VaR daily. We
have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR, and we
maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory
market risk requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is
calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during
a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99%
confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same
model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to
historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that
reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model is
designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst
continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed
VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period
with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during
that twelve-month period of financial stress. For each portfolio, the
stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year
time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from
within the available historical data. This historical data set includes
the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the
Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard & Poor's
downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011, and the market
volatility triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. As the
historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over
time, future market stress events will be incorporated.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer
in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk
component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions
in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of
the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level
(for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Credit and
Market Risk Committee (CMRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as
appropriate, and reviewed by the CMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and
the implementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This backtesting involves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market
movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as
estimated revenue from intra-day trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves,
such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
We had one back-testing exception in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which was driven by market volatility in GBP towards the end of
September. We had no back-testing exceptions in the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. At a 99% confidence interval, the
statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).
The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended
September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables
below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in
our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The three month average of our total stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $28 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022,
compared to an average of approximately $41 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and $55 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.
The decrease in the average total stressed VaR compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2022, is primarily attributed to lower foreign exchange and
interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite
for taking market risk in our trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual
market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction in VaR measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to
regulatory review and approval, and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based
measures.
The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate
risk and volatility risk as of September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Diversification effect in the tables below
represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our
trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that
is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the
economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates.
While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our
exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest
these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet
mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast
of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 32, Key Interest Rates for Baseline
Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Our
September 30, 2022 baseline forecast broadly aligns to the market’s expectations for a rapid increase in global central bank rates in response to
rising inflation. In addition to higher interest rates, we are also forecasting gradual deposit balance rotation and reductions along with increasing
deposit betas as a result of quantitative tightening and rising interest rates.

In Table 33: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to
various tenors on the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no
management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rates changes on our financial performance. While investment securities
balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances
and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes gradual deposit balance rotation and reductions. In lower rate
scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.

Our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an NII benefit in higher rate scenarios. However, our
USD balance sheet has become liability driven by rising USD deposit betas and deposit balance rotation. Our NII sensitivities assumes no
management actions are taken to change modeled outcomes including the +100 basis point scenario which assumes that the level of Fed Funds
reaches 5.5%.
As of September 30, 2022, USD NII benefits in lower rate scenarios and is exposed to higher rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the
short-end of the yield curve. Compared to September 30, 2021, our short-end USD sensitivity has changed due to the higher level of market interest
rates and the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program resulting in higher deposit betas and deposit balance rotation and reductions. Longend USD sensitivities have decreased since September 30, 2021 through the implementation of investment portfolio risk reduction strategies resulting
in lower securities duration.
As of September 30, 2022, non-USD NII benefits in higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on
the short-end of the yield curve. Compared to September 30, 2021, our short-end non-USD sensitivity to higher rates has increased due to the ECB
shifting from negative to positive interest rates resulting in lower deposit betas. Our short-end non-USD sensitivity to lower rates has become negative
as higher interest rates and higher forecasted baseline NII have increased non-USD NII at risk to lower rates.
NII sensitivity is routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial
services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on
sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial
decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a
significant advancement in financial management and a source of
risk. In large banking organizations like us, model results influence
business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on
our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management
Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management
framework, including our governance and model validation, refer to
pages 111 to 112 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Model Risk Management", in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on
earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper
implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to
industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in
the business environment; decline in market performance or changes
in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of
reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate,
credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic
risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital
management processes.
On March 5, 2021, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark
Administration (IBA), in conjunction with the United Kingdom
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), announced that it would cease
the publication of all EUR and Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the
overnight, one week, two week, two month and twelve month GBP
LIBOR and Japanese Yen (JPY) LIBOR settings, and the one week
and two months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, as of December 31,
2021. Furthermore, the IBA announced that as of June 30, 2023, it
would cease the publication of the overnight and twelve months U.S.
dollar LIBOR settings and that as of June 30, 2023 the one month,
three month and six month USD LIBOR setting would become nonrepresentative. On September 29, 2021, the FCA announced that it
would compel the IBA to continue the publication of the one month,
three month and six month GBP and JPY settings, on a synthetic,
non-representative basis from year-end 2021 for a period of at least
one year.
On June 30, 2022, the FCA issued a consultation on winding
down synthetic tenors of GBP LIBOR and on the potential
introduction of a synthetic version of certain USD LIBOR settings as
of June 30, 2023. On September 29, 2022, the FCA confirmed in
conjunction with the IBA, the cessation of all synthetic JPY LIBOR
settings as of December 31, 2022 and the cessation of the one
month and six month GBP LIBOR setting as of March 2023. The FCA
continues to assess the appropriate cessation date for the remaining
three month GBP LIBOR setting and whether to compel the
publication of any synthetic version of certain USD LIBOR tenors. A
decision on these matters is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.
On March 15, 2022, the U.S. Congress adopted, as part of the
Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022, the Adjustable Interest
(LIBOR) Act which provides certain statutory requirements and
guidance for the selection and use of alternative reference rates in
legacy financial contracts governed by U.S. law that do not provide
for the use of a clearly defined or practicable alternative reference
rate. On July 19, 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of
proposed rulemaking on a proposal to implement the LIBOR Act, as
required by its terms. A final rule is expected to be issued by the
Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2022.
We have established a process to identify, assess, plan for and
remediate the use of LIBOR and other reference rates affected by
reference rate reform that addresses both direct exposures on our
balance sheet, and, more importantly, the use of LIBOR in our
various roles as service provider to our customers. This process is
led by a firm-wide, multidisciplinary LIBOR program management
office (“LIBOR PMO”), established in September 2018, that will
continue to lead our transition efforts through June 2023.
The LIBOR PMO reports regularly to executive management of
the firm and our key regulators on progress with respect to the
adoption of alternative reference rates for various financial products
and services, client communications, updating of our quantitative
models and information technology systems, managing vendors,
contracts remediation, evaluation of fallback provisions contained in
LIBOR-priced loans, investment securities, derivatives and long-term
debt and general operational readiness for each stage of the
transition. Most of the LIBOR PMO's work for implementation of the
transition to alternative reference rates is substantially complete, and
contingency plans have been developed with respect to identified
uncertainties.
State Street Corporation | 42
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
No incremental material investments are expected to be needed
for systems and processes related to the transition. Potential risks
that could impact our remediation efforts include overall transition
readiness across the industry, third party vendor dependencies and
resource constraints from the concentration of remediation activities
at key points in the transition process.
Our direct on balance sheet exposure to LIBOR is limited and
primarily includes assets held in the investment portfolio, certain
loans made through Global Credit Finance and issuances of longterm debt and preferred stock. We have planned for, and are
prepared to, transition our remaining on balance sheet exposures in
a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and the availability of
interim solutions for various legacy LIBOR contracts. We will not
originate or issue new LIBOR-based loans or long-term debt, and any
purchases of LIBOR-based investment securities will be screened for
adequate fallback language. Our remaining exposure outstanding at
June 2023 is largely governed by existing fallback language, or
national legislation that provides for appropriate fallback provisions.
Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the
market transition away from the use of LIBOR as an interest rate
benchmark in financial instruments and contracts. Our financial
performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to market
changes promptly, while avoiding increased related expenses or
operational errors.
For additional information about our strategic risk management
framework and associated risks, refer to pages 112 to 113 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, "Strategic Risk Management",
in our 2021 Form 10-K, and page 44 included under Item 1A, Risk
Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K - "The market transition away from
broad use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as an
interest rate benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may
expose us to increased operational, model and financial risk."
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and
projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are
in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are
sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future
strategic business initiatives. We assess capital adequacy based on
relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal
capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as
evaluated by banking
regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital
surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III
final rule. Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently
subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to the required minimum of
3% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any regulatory
buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital
distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as
systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree
of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore
some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital,
liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 113
to 121 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form
10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking
organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are
also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by U.S.
banking regulators.
The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for
monitoring capital adequacy: the “standardized approach" and the
“advanced approaches", applicable to advanced approaches banking
organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes
standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk
weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures. The
advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal RatingsBased Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk,
and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of
RWA related to operational risk.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 and the
SCB rule enacted in 2020, we and State Street Bank, as advanced
approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor,"
also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our
regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer
(CCB) and the SCB, for the advanced approaches and standardized
approach, respectively, and a countercyclical capital buffer. In
addition, we are subject to a G-SIB surcharge. Our risk-based capital
ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio
calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized
approach.
State Street Corporation | 43
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and
lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA)
from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB
or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to
executive officers. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by U.S. banking regulators.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2022, include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and
standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This results in minimum risk-based ratios of
8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2023, is 1.0%. Based on a calculation as of December 31, 2021, our G-SIB surcharge
beginning January 1, 2024 could increase to 1.5%. Accordingly, we have developed a balance sheet management plan intended to result in a G-SIB
surcharge calculation of 1.0% as of December 31, 2022 which, if effective, would result in our maintaining our current G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%
through December 31, 2024.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are
required, among other requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of
our trading positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also
requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our
related VaR and stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under "Market Risk
Management" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates
indicated. We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated
under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the
Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss
event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization
dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the
advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 23, 2022, we were notified by
the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2022 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2022 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which is in effect from October 1, 2022 through
September 30, 2023.

Our CET1 capital decreased $0.82 billion as of September 30, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to unrealized losses on
AFS securities within AOCI driven by the significant increase in rates across the yield curve, partially offset by net income. Our Tier 1 capital

As of September 30, 2022, total advanced approaches RWA decreased $3.63 billion compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by a
decrease in operational risk and market risk RWA. The decrease in operational risk RWA was primarily due to a decrease in the frequency of certain
operational loss events. The decrease in market risk RWA was mainly driven by defensive positioning given market uncertainty and a decrease in
volatility of the VaR model.
As of September 30, 2022, total standardized approach RWA increased $3.02 billion compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by an
increase in credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by the implementation of SA-CCR, as expected, which was partially
offset by lower repo-style transactions RWA.
The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2022, presented in Table 34: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital
Ratios, are calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced
approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of September 30, 2022, based on
our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced
systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual
report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our
advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for
which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical
experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory
interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss
experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our
advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An
operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced
approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the
distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results
of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision
or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital
ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be
material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject
to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a
supplementary leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on
Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet
assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that
the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of
on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes offbalance sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1
leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. GSIB, we must maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any
limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus
payments to certain executives. If we do not maintain this buffer,
limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments
would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean
holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as
us, is intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain
U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards,
and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory
capital and LTD) and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
External TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus
2.5% plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for
these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus
any applicable counter- cyclical buffer, which
is currently 0%); and
• 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5%
minimum plus the SLR buffer of 2.0%), as
defined by the SLR final rule.
Qualifying external LTD
Greater of:
• 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB
surcharge calculated for these purposes under
method 2 of 1.0%); and
• 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by
the SLR final rule.
As of April 1, 2020, the TLAC and LTD requirements calibrated
to the SLR denominator reflect the deduction of certain central bank
balances as prescribed by the regulatory relief implemented under
EGRRCPA.
The following table presents external TLAC and external LTD as
of September 30, 2022:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Regulatory Developments
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which
would replace the current 2.0% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer
equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge. This proposal would also
make conforming modifications to our TLAC and eligible LTD
requirements applicable to G-SIBs. At this point in time, it is unclear
whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed.
In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal
banking agencies issued a final rule that, among other things,
implemented the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk
(SA-CCR), a methodology for calculating the exposure amount for
derivative contracts. Under the final rule, which became effective on
January 1, 2022, we have the option to use the SA-CCR or the
Internal Model Methodology (IMM) to measure the exposure amount
of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our
advanced approaches calculation. We have elected to use the SACCR for purposes of our advanced approaches capital calculations.
We are required to determine the amount of these exposures using
the SA-CCR under our standardized approach capital calculation.
Additionally, we have to apply a revised formula to determine the
RWA amount of our central counterparty default fund contributions.
The Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies
issued an interim final rule effective in March 2020 and later finalized
on a permanent basis on August 26, 2020, which revised the
definition of eligible retained income for all U.S. banking
organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained income
makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions, where a
banking organization's regulatory ratios were to decline below the
respective minimum requirements, take effect on a more gradual
basis.
Effective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S.
federal banking agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA
that establishes a deduction for qualifying central bank deposits from
a
custodial banking organization’s total leverage exposure equal to the
lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking
organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at
qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on
deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to
fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. For the quarter
ended September 30, 2022, we deducted $64.1 billion of average
balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used
in the calculation of our SLR, based on this custodial banking
deduction.
On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S.
federal banking agencies issued a final rule that requires us and
State Street Bank to make certain deductions from regulatory capital
for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments, including
eligible LTD under the TLAC rule, issued by the Parent Company and
other U.S. and foreign G-SIBs. The final rule became effective on
April 1, 2021.
Our SCB requirement for the period from October 1, 2021
through September 30, 2022 was 2.5%. On June 23, 2022, we were
notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2022
supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2022
supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting
in an SCB at that floor, which went into effect starting October 1,
2022 and will run through September 30, 2023.
On September 9, 2022, the U.S. Banking Agencies reaffirmed
their commitment to implementing revised regulatory capital
requirements that align with the final set of Basel III standards (Basel
IV package) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
in December 2017. They intend to seek public comments on a joint
proposed rule in the coming months.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock
dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a common
share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021. We repurchased $475 million of our
common stock in the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $425
million of our common stock through June 30, 2021, in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. We repurchased $425 million of our
common stock in the second quarter of 2021. In July 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion
of our common stock through the end of 2022.
In connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business, we did not repurchase any common stock during the last half
of 2021, as well as during the first nine months of 2022. We intend to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock in the fourth quarter
of 2022 under the existing share repurchase program, expiring December 21, 2022.

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In
addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on
dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 54 to 56 in "Related Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in our 2021 Form 10-K, and to pages 169 to 171 in Note 15 to the
consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and
amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market
purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing
and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period
to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and financial performance, investment opportunities, market
conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock issued as part of
employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most
circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though
these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring
processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $339.55 billion and $385.74 billion as of September 30, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the
securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in
our consolidated statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if
excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $355.85 billion and $404.12 billion as
collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party
repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified
repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the
indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral
of $355.85 billion and $404.12 billion, referenced above, $59.79 billion and $61.56 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of
September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We or our agents held $64.52 billion and $67.01 billion as collateral for indemnified
investments in repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based
on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2022.
We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the
ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems
or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result
of these efforts. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, no change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
