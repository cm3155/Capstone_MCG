MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02111 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 (Form 10-Q), unless the
context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar
terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial strength to our
subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary,
State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street Bank, we provide
a broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide,
with $41.72 trillion of AUC/A and $4.02 trillion of AUM as of March 31, 2022.
As of March 31, 2022, we had consolidated total assets of $322.35 billion,
consolidated total deposits of $251.04 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $26.22 billion and 39,335 employees. We operate in more than 100 geographic
markets worldwide, including in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East and
Asia.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of the Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2021 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 previously filed with the SEC
(2021 Form 10-K). You should read the financial information contained in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q in
conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our 2021 Form 10-
K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-Q have been
reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters
that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
• accounting for fair value measurements;
• impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;
• contingencies; and
• allowance for credit losses.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex
judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision
as new information becomes available. For additional information about these
significant accounting policies refer to pages 124 to 126, “Significant Accounting
Estimates” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-K. We did not
change these significant accounting policies in the first three months of 2022.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, or
reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis. We measure and compare certain financial
information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management uses in
evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information should be
considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial
information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial
information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP-basis
measure.
We further believe that our presentation of FTE NII, a non-GAAP measure,
which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with taxexempt investment securities, on a FTE basis, facilitates an investor's
understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory
standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with
respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading
activities) and the LCR, summary results of semi-annual State StreetState Street Corporation | 4

run stress tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan
disclosures required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional disclosures are
accessible on the “Investor Relations” section of our corporate website at
www.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual
reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and
abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us
under the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other
public statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in
our Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as
applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
U.S. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations
regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations,
strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio
performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, outcomes of legal
proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, client
growth and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry,
governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and
developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate
strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,” “forecast,”
“outlook,” “believe,” “priority,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “trend,”
“target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms, are
intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
which change over time, are based on management's expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future
results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of
the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of
factors affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the
equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to
State
Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could cause
changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking statements
are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not limited to:
Strategic Risks
• The consummation of our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor
Services business is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the
satisfaction of other closing conditions, the failure or delay of which may
prevent or delay the consummation of the acquisition; while we are
evaluating potential modifications to the transaction that are intended to
facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review, there can be no
assurance as to the timing or outcome of that review;
• Even if we successfully consummate our proposed acquisition of the BBH
Investor Services business, we may fail to realize some or all of the
anticipated benefits of the transaction or the benefits may take longer to
realize than expected;
• We are subject to intense competition, which could negatively affect our
profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability in our financial
results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and services, including
State Street Digital or State Street Alpha, and the enhancement of our
infrastructure required to meet increased regulatory and client expectations
for resiliency and the systems and process re-engineering necessary to
achieve improved productivity and reduced operating risk, may involve
costs and dependencies and expose us to increased risk;
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and
maintain our technology infrastructure;
• The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate certain risks and
uncertainties for our business;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and the
integration, retention and development of the benefits of our acquisitions,
pose risks for our business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support
our business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by geopolitical, economic and market
conditions; including, for example, as a result of the present war in Ukraine;
• We have significant International operations, and disruptions in European
and Asian economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations or financial condition;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and
consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes
in the financial markets;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk to counterparties, who may also have
substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions, and
these credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial
loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our consolidated
revenue and is subject to decline based on, among other factors, market
and currency declines, investment activities of our clients and their business
mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, our
consolidated financial condition, capital ratios, results of operations and
business prospects could be adversely affected;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not
be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an actual or
perceived reduction in our financial strength, our borrowing and capital
costs, liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common share
repurchases, may be adversely affected by capital and liquidity standards
required as a result of capital stress testing;
• We face extensive and changing government regulation in the jurisdictions
in which we operate, which may increase our costs and compliance risks;
• We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of the resolution
of prior regulatory or governmental matters;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and
litigation;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have
an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory
actions, litigation and other adverse effects;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios depend on
data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are
subject to change, which could materially impact our risk exposures, our
total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated
financial statements;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions
and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our
effective tax rate; and
• The transition away from LIBOR may result in additional costs and
increased risk exposure.
Operational Risks
• Our control environment may be inadequate, fail or be circumvented, and
operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of
operations;
• Cost shifting to non-U.S. jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to
increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and reputational harm and may
not result in expected cost savings;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or
facilities, or those of the third parties with which we do business, or
disruptions to our or their continuous operations, could result in significant
costs, reputational damage and impacts on our business activities;
• Long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk;
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other
reputational harm;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors
that could result in material harm;
State Street Corporation | 6
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur
substantial losses or are restricted in redeeming their interests in
investment pools that we sponsor or manage;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses to such risks,
could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including terrorist
attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a new pandemic or acts of
embezzlement.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our
forward looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the
factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our
other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be
relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no
obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made.
The factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all
risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all
developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions and should
not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in
State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings,
including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our
annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act
of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the

The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section provides information
related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial
results for the first quarter of 2022 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial
Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including
the comparison of our financial results for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the
same period in 2021, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line
of Business Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as in
our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. In this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign
currency translation, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted
average FX rates from the relevant 2021 period to the relevant 2022 period results.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial Results and Highlights
• First quarter of 2022 financial performance:
◦ Earnings per share of $1.57 in the first quarter of 2022, increased
15% compared to $1.37 in the same period in 2021.
◦ Total fee revenue and total revenue were both up 4% in the first
quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
◦ Servicing and management fee revenues were flat and increased
5%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same
period in 2021.
◦ In the first quarter of 2022, return on equity of 9.5% increased from
8.4% in the same period in 2021, primarily due to an increase in net
income available to common shareholders. Pre-tax margin of
24.5% in the first quarter of 2022, increased from 21.3% in the
same period in 2021, primarily due to an increase in total revenue.
◦ Positive operating leverage of 4.6% points in the first quarter of
2022. Operating leverage represents the difference between the
percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in
total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period.
◦ Positive fee operating leverage of 3.8% points in the first quarter of
2022. Fee operating leverage represents the difference between
the percentage change in total fee revenue and the percentage
change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year
period.
• While the ongoing war in Ukraine caused considerable challenges for global
markets in the first quarter of 2022, our direct financial exposure to Russia
is very low, with less than $25 million of deposits denominated in Russian
roubles, and with less than 0.1% of our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our
AUM consisting of Russian securities, as of March 31, 2022. As of March
31, 2022, we had no direct credit exposures to Russian-domiciled entities,
including the Russian central bank, other than our subcustodian in Russia,
which is an affiliate of a large multinational bank.
• Approximately 73% of our employees globally continued to work remotely
as of March 31, 2022, compared to approximately 79% as of December 31,
2021, primarily due to the transition to hybrid working in many locations
worldwide.
Revenue
• Total fee revenue and total revenue both increased 4% in the first quarter of
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily driven by increases
across management fees, foreign exchange trading services, software and
processing fees and other fee revenue.
• Servicing fee revenue was flat in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021, as higher client activity and flows, average equity
market levels, and net new business were offset by normal pricing
headwinds and the impact of currency translation. Currency translation
negatively impacted servicing fees by 2% in the first quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021.
• Management fee revenue increased 5% in the first quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher average
equity market levels and net inflows from ETFs.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue increased 4% in the first quarter
of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher FX
volatility, partially offset by lower client FX volumes.
• Securities finance revenue decreased 3% in the first quarter of 2022,
compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting lower average agency
assets on loan, partially offset by new business wins in enhanced custody.
• Software and processing fees revenue increased 26% in the first quarter of
2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher frontoffice servicing revenues.
• Other fee revenue increased 81% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to
the same period in 2021, primarily due to fair value adjustments on equity
investments.
• NII increased 9% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period
in 2021, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and higher loan
balances, as well as higher market interest rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Provision for Credit Losses
• We recorded no provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022,
compared to a $9 million reserve release in the same period in 2021, as
positive changes in the mix of loans in our portfolio were offset by a
downward shift in management's economic outlook.
Expenses
• Total expenses were flat in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same
period in 2021, as higher targeted business investments and seasonal
expenses were offset by productivity savings, ongoing disciplined expense
management and lower notable items.
Notable items
• The impact of notable items in the first quarter of 2022 includes acquisition
and restructuring costs of approximately $9 million related to our proposed
acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business, which is subject to
regulatory review and other closing conditions.
• The impact of notable items in the first quarter of 2021 includes:
◦ legal and other expenses of approximately $29 million, including
$20 million in information systems and communications, $8 million
in transaction processing services and $1 million in other expenses;
◦ acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately $10 million,
primarily related to our 2018 acquisition of CRD;
◦ costs of $5 million due to the partial redemption of outstanding
Series F non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock representing the
difference between the redemption value and the net carrying value
of the preferred stock.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $41.72 trillion increased 4% as of March 31, 2022, compared to
March 31, 2021, primarily due to higher equity market levels, client flows
and net new business growth. In the first quarter of 2022, newly announced
asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $302 billion. Servicing
assets remaining to be installed in future period totaled approximately
$2.91 trillion as of March 31, 2022.
• AUM of $4.02 trillion increased 12% as of March 31, 2022, compared to
March 31, 2021, primarily due to higher market levels and net inflows
across our ETF, Institutional and Cash businesses.
Capital
• We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.57 per share,
totaling $209 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $0.52 per
share, totaling $182 million in the same period in 2021.
• In July 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase plan of up
to $3.0 billion of our common stock through the end of 2022; however, in
connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services
business, we did not repurchase any common stock during the third and
fourth quarters of 2021, as well as the first quarter of 2022. We no longer
expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second and third
quarter of 2022 due primarily to net unrealized losses on AFS securities
reported in Other Comprehensive Income for the first quarter of 2022
related to higher interest rates (described below).
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 11.9% as of March 31,
2022, compared to 14.3% as of December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting
lower AOCI related to AFS securities driven by the significant increase in
rates across the yield curve, the implementation of the standardized
approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), as well as the temporary
deployment of RWA capital for revenue generating activities in our markets
businesses. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 5.9% as of March 31,
2022 compared to 6.1% as of December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower
AOCI. Actions are underway that are intended to mitigate additional AOCI
risk in the current environment, including, but not limited to, transfers of
securities from AFS to HTM, and shortening the portfolio duration through
hedging activities and portfolio runoff. There can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient if the pace of rate increases continues at a
historical level. We expect both our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios
to be at or near the lower end of our target ranges of 10-11% and 5.25-
5.75%, respectively, during the quarter within which the proposed
acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business closes.

that we will redeem all of the Notes on May 15, 2022.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the first

In the first quarter of 2022, we reclassified certain fee revenue in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, primarily moving revenues that are not directly associated with software and processing fees to a new Other fee revenue line
item. In addition, we provided a disaggregation of servicing fees into Back office services and Middle office services and
of software and processing fees into Front office software and data and Lending related and other fees. Prior periods
were revised to reflect these changes.

Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the first
quarter of 2022 and 2021. Servicing and management fees collectively made up
approximately 73% and 75% of the total fee revenue in the first quarter of 2022 and
2021, respectively.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle
office services. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors
including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new
business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of
services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and
administration, which we refer to collectively as back office services, and middle
office services. The nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees.
The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic
and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a
corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though
the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography
of assets held within our clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the
valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our
valuation is dependent on third party information, AUC/A is reported on a lag,
typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our
reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end market levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that worldwide
market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately 3% on
average with a range of 0% to 7% annually and approximately 7% and 2% in 2021
and 2020, respectively. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and
Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes
relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of
associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the
performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may
differ from those industry classifications presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31, 2022 that a 10%
increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a
corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain
constant and using relevant information as of March 31, 2022, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less
volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a significantly smaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire
transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors,
including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five
years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on average with a range of
(1)% to 2% annually and approximately 0% and 2% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market
trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

The first quarter of 2022 data for Europe is on a rolling three month basis for December 2021 through February 2022, sourced by Morningstar.
Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 1% on
average with a range of 0% to 3% annually and approximately 1% and 0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross investment servicing mandates were $302 billion in the first quarter
of 2022 and $1.8 trillion per year on average over the past five years. Over the five years ended December 31, 2021, gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from
$750 billion to $3.5 trillion.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of
assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from
6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. Our more complex installations, including new State Street Alpha
mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.91 trillion that are yet to be installed as of March 31,
2022, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 24 months.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no
assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially. On average, over
the five years ended December 31, 2021, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the
impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year, and approximately (2)% in both 2021 and 2020. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client
including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on
manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services, and the
amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new
services, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from
new clients.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, we
estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year; although,
notwithstanding increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to several
factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner in which we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and
the type of services and the other factors described in this Form 10-Q.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that
approximately 55%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable
due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of
AUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume
of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 30% of our
servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations
or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new
business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending
on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of
changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully
reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur,
particularly in periods of higher volatility.
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, were flat in the first
quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, as higher client activity and
flows, average equity market levels, and net new business were offset by normal
pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation. Currency translation
negatively impacted servicing fees by 2% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to
the same period in 2021.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% of total
servicing fees in both the first quarter of 2022 and 2021.

Consistent with past practice, AUC/A values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.
Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the
underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the first quarter of 2022 totaled
approximately $302 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future
periods totaled approximately $2.91 trillion as of March 31, 2022, which will be
reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee
revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be
realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that
period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive
agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary
regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining
to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been
contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly
disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These
excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new
asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed
in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and
servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross
basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us
during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us,
which may from time to time be significant.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide
various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping,
transaction processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and
record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as
investment book of records (IBOR), transaction management, loans, cash,
derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment
analytics, markets services such as FX trading services, liquidity solutions, currency
and collateral management, securities finance, and front office services such as
portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis, performance and
attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and ESG
investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary
based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation, and the
types of assets.
As a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing
clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its ETF assets
currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending necessary
approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after
this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business. The
transition is expected to begin in 2022, but will principally occur in 2023 and 2024.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the fee revenue associated with the
transitioning assets represented approximately 1.9% of our total 2021 fee revenue.
The actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range of
factors, including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and
expense reductions associated with the transition.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report
based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of
managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective
Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of
AUM. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than
servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided,
and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets
managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While
certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the
investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee
arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients. In addition, in a
prolonged low-interest rate environment, we have waived and may in the future
waive certain fees for our clients for money market products.
The impact of State Street Global Advisors gross money market fund fee
waivers on total management fee revenue was approximately $10 million in the first
quarter of 2022, down from levels in prior quarters. Following the Federal Reserve
rate hike in March 2022, we do not expect money market fund fee waivers to
materially impact subsequent quarters in 2022.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our
AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM
than for actively managed products. Actively managed products may also include
performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based
on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's
performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31,
2022, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of
business won and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted
average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees
are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total
management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of
approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average
basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity
markets, will have a significantly smaller impact on our management fee
revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate
worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee
revenue. Year-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3:
Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected
indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends,
the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ,
and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can
therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset
classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management fees increased 5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher average equity market levels and net inflows from
ETFs.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 27% of total management fees in both the first quarter of 2022 and 2021.

Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 4% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
due to higher FX volatility, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Foreign exchange trading services revenue comprises revenue generated by FX trading and revenue generated
by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 69% and 31%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the first quarter of 2022, compared to and 70%
and 30%, respectively in the same period in 2021. The impact of gross money market fund fee waivers on foreign exchange trading services was $10 million in the first quarter of
2022, compared to $8 million in the same period in 2021. This represents a reduction in revenue on the Fund Connect platform due to the impact of fee waivers by participating
money market funds, including State Street Global Advisors funds.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX desk through our assetservicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market
conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading
revenues often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix
tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either
direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker,
enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at
another bank.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic
FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions
through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions
generate revenue through a “click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which
are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions
charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global
trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money
market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we
refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset
owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer
to as our enhanced custody business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is
composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees
related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on
loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the
lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the
subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when
the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and
execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we
provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we
source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as
principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets
under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased
3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily
driven by lower average agency assets on loan, partially offset by new business
wins in enhanced custody.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending
activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards,
interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending
activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our
structured products business.
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2: Total Revenue,
increased 26% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
Front office software and data revenue, which includes primarily revenue from
CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, increased 44% in the first
quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher CRD
revenue from on-premises renewals. Revenue related to the front office solutions
provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS,
including professional services such as consulting and implementation services,
software support and maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated
with a sale of software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time
when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software
license, with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other
contractual terms. The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is
recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are
provided. Upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of
revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the
balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS related
arrangement, where the
State Street Corporation | 17
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of
the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of a SaaS arrangement,
revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new
contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are
accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to
quarter.
Lending related and other fees, which decreased 2% in the first quarter of
2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily consists of fee revenue
associated with our fund finance, leverage loans, municipal finance, insurance and
stable value wrap businesses.
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated
with certain tax-advantaged investments and other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue increased 81% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021, primarily reflecting fair value adjustments on equity
investments.
Fair value adjustments on equity investments positively impacted other fee
revenue by approximately $55 million and $8 million in the first quarter of 2022 and
2021, respectively. Market-related adjustments negatively impacted other fee
revenue by approximately $15 million and $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 and

Amortization of tax-advantaged investments negatively impacted other fee
revenue by approximately $24 million and $26 million in the first quarter of 2022 and
2021, respectively.
Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line of Business
Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest
expense for the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less
interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets,
which principally consist of investment securities,
interest-bearing deposits with banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid
assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and longterm debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total
interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average
interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned
from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a
FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.
NII on an FTE basis increased in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021, primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and higher
loan balances, as well as higher market interest rates.
Investment securities net premium amortization, which is included in interest
income, was $87 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $169 million in the
same period in 2021, primarily driven by lower prepayments.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated
statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the
security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as
purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for
prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities amortizable purchase
premium net of discount accretion for the periods indicated:

 Rates earned/paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge activities associated with our asset and liability management activities where applicable.
 Negative values reflect the interest rate environment outside of the U.S. where central bank rates are below zero for several major currencies.
Reflects the impact of balance sheet netting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $55.02 billion for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $87.37 billion in the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.07% in the first
quarter of 2022 compared to 0.04% in the same period in 2021.
Average rate includes the impact of FX swap costs of approximately ($13) million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to ($21) million for the same period in 2021. Average rates for total interest-bearing deposits excluding the impact of FX swap costs were (0.11)% in the first quarter of 2022,
compared to (0.11)% in the same period in 2021.
Total deposits averaged $233.27 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $226.23 billion in the same period in 2021.
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the components of interest
income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements within this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $258.11 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $254.73 billion in the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to
higher client deposit balances, partially offset by a reduction in average other liabilities.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $76.74 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $95.24 billion in the same period in 2021. These deposits primarily reflect
our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The lower levels of average cash balances with
central banks reflect growth in securities and loans.
Securities repurchased under resale agreements averaged $3.15 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $4.57 billion in the same period in 2021. We maintain an
agreement with Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a clearing organization that enables us to net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those repurchased
under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization, when specific netting criteria are met. The impact of balance sheet netting
decreased to $55.02 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $87.37 billion in the same period in 2021, primarily driven by lower gross FICC repurchase agreement volumes
and the continued impact from extensive Federal Reserve stimulus. The decline on balance sheet was primarily due to lower gross FICC repurchase agreement volumes, but also
reflects our ability to net a portion of our Global Treasury repurchase agreement activity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We have been a sponsoring member within FICC since 2005 and continue to
expand our client base as program eligibility parameters broaden. We enter into
repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and
with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities Division
rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their
eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the
prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’
respective obligations. We generally obtain a security interest from our sponsored
clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to
mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Average investment securities were $119.29 billion in the first quarter of 2022
compared to $107.81 billion in the same period in 2021. The increase reflects higher
U.S. Treasuries, agencies, MBS and CMBS balances, which was primarily driven by
the elevated levels of our client deposit portfolio.
Loans averaged $34.41 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $28.03
billion in the same period in 2021. Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts and
highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio over the prior year, averaged
$28.83 billion in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $23.80 billion in the same
period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to growth in CLOs in loan form and
fund finance loans. Additional information about these loans is provided in Note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced
custody business, increased to $23.77 billion in the first quarter of 2022 from $18.30
billion in the same period in 2021, primarily driven by an increase in the level of
cash collateral posted due to higher average deposits. Enhanced custody is our
securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to our custody
clients and generate securities finance revenue. The NII earned on these
transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative
investments.
Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $183.63 billion
in the first quarter of 2022 from $179.41 billion in the same period in 2021. Average
U.S. interest-bearing deposits increased as a result of U.S. monetary policy and the
level of global interest rates. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the
underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior and market conditions,
including the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet and the general levels of
U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings increased to $0.87 billion in the first
quarter of 2022 from $0.76 billion in the same period in 2021.
Average long-term debt was $14.27 billion in the first quarter of 2022
compared to $13.82 billion in the same period in 2021. These amounts reflect
issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $2.88 billion in the first quarter of
2022 compared to $4.85 billion in the same period in 2021. Other interest-bearing
liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in
connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis
where we have enforceable netting agreements.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume
and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet
management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations
of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the
yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of
credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,
we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities
of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal
agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.
The pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will
depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our
reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses We recorded no provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022, as
positive changes in the mix of loans in our portfolio were offset by a downward shift
in management's economic outlook. This compares to a $9 million reserve release
in the first quarter of 2021.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial Condition" in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.

Compensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 1% in the first
quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower
headcount in high cost locations and lower salaries, partially offset by higher
seasonal expenses.
Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses were $208 million in the
first quarter of 2022 compared to $176 million in the same period in 2021.
Total headcount was flat as of March 31, 2022 compared to March 31, 2021,
primarily driven by hiring in global hubs, offset by a reduction in high cost locations.
Information systems and communications expenses were flat in the first
quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting the
absence of notable items reported in the first quarter of 2021, offset by higher
technology infrastructure investments.
Transaction processing services expenses decreased 2% in the first quarter of
2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting the absence of
notable items reported in the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher subcustody and higher broker fees, primarily due to higher transaction volumes.
Occupancy expenses decreased 13% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to
the same period in 2021, primarily due to footprint optimization.
Amortization of other intangible assets increased 5% in the first quarter of 2022
compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the lift-out in the first quarter
of 2021 of the depository bank and fund
administrator activities of Fideuram Bank Luxembourg, a subsidiary of Intesa
Sanpaolo.
Other expenses increased 9% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to the
same period in 2021, primarily driven by higher professional services, partially offset
by lower sub-advisory fees.
Acquisition Costs
We recorded approximately $9 million of acquisition costs in the first quarter of
2022 related to our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor services business. We
expect to incur up to approximately $590 million of total acquisition and integration
costs related to the acquisition through the third year following its closing. The
acquisition is subject to regulatory reviews and other closing conditions.
We recorded approximately $11 million of acquisition costs in the first quarter
of 2021 related to our acquisition of CRD in 2018. Starting in 2022, we no longer
distinguish certain CRD costs as acquisition costs.

$108 million in the same period in 2021. Our effective tax rate was 19.9% in the first
quarter of 2022 compared to 17.2% in the same period in 2021, primarily due to a
lower impact of tax advantaged investments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
LINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION
Our operations are organized into two lines of business: Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided. The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily
comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial
services industry.
Our Investment Servicing line of business provides a range of services to our
clients. Through State Street Institutional Services, State Street Global Markets,
State Street Digital and CRD, we provide services for institutional clients, including
mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and
public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations
and endowments worldwide. Our financial services and products allow our large
institutional investor clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis in
markets across the globe. As most institutional investors cannot economically or
efficiently build their own technology and operational processes necessary to
facilitate their global securities settlement needs, our primary role as a global trust
and custody bank is to aid our clients to efficiently perform services associated with
the clearing, settlement and execution of securities transactions and related
payments.
Products under the Investment Servicing line of business include: back office
products such as custody, accounting, regulatory reporting, investor services,
performance and analytics; middle office products such as IBOR, transaction
management, loans, cash, derivatives and collateral services, record keeping, client
reporting and investment analytics; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading
services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term
investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative
investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance
analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.
Included within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we
acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management System is a
technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional
investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk
analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and
managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in
building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha
platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, analytics and
compliance tools, and advanced data aggregation and integration with other
industry platforms and providers. In 2021, we further expanded our technology
offering with the acquisition of Mercatus, Inc., enabling the launch of Alpha for
Private Markets.
In 2021, we established State Street Digital to focus on the development of
digital assets and technologies, including crypto, central bank digital currency,
blockchain and tokenization, including the evolution of a new integrated business
and digital operating model designed to support our clients' digital investment cycle.
Following completion of our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services
business, the acquired business will be included within our Investment Servicing line
of business. The acquisition is subject to regulatory reviews and other closing
conditions.
The regulatory review process for our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor
Services business has progressed more slowly than anticipated. Some regulatory
approvals, most notably approvals of the relevant U.S. federal banking agencies,
remain outstanding. We are evaluating potential modifications to the transaction that
are intended to facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review. We are working
towards concluding regulatory reviews during the third quarter. While we are
engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the relevant U.S. federal banking agencies,
there can be no assurance as to the timing or outcome of their regulatory review.
Investment Management, through State Street Global Advisors, provides a
broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our
investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for
equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multiasset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and
alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to
indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions,
including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and
defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief
Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs,
including the SPDR ETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined
by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees
reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective
management agreements related to performance fees.

Servicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 17: Investment Servicing Line of
Business Results, were flat in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period
in 2021, as higher client activity and flows, average equity market levels, and net
new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency
translation. Currency translation negatively impacted servicing fees by 2% in the
first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.
Additional information about servicing fees is provided under "Fee Revenue" in
"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and

Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 2% in the first quarter of
2022 compared to the same period in 2021, as expense growth from higher
technology infrastructure investments and higher incentive compensation was
partially offset by productivity savings, expense management and currency
translation benefit. Currency translation decreased expenses for Investment
Servicing by 1% in the first quarter of 2022 relative to the same period in 2021.
Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were
$161 million in the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Additional information about expenses is provided under "Expenses" in
"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and
Analysis.
For additional information about our two lines of business, as well as the
revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies associated with them,
refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by
the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management
lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine
balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and
short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities
are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are
denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment
alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than
our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek
to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational
in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our
assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and shortduration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and
securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is
determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a
well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.
The following information on our financial condition is based on our average
balance sheet, which we believe is the better measure of our balance sheet trends
as period-end balances can be impacted by the timing of client activities including
deposits and withdrawals.

non-agency CMBS and $12 million and $14 million of non-agency RMBS, respectively.
Approximately $2.3 billion was transferred from AFS to HTM securities in the first quarter of 2022.
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate
and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall
structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global
interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality
investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our
consolidated statement of condition.
Actions are underway that are intended to mitigate additional AOCI risk in the
current environment, including, but not limited to, transfers of securities from AFS to
HTM, and shortening the portfolio duration through hedging activities and portfolio
runoff. There can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient if the pace
of rate increases continues at a historical level.
Average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 2.8 years and 2.9
years as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Approximately 93% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated “AAA” or
“AA” as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

As of March 31, 2022, other non-U.S. investments include $7.71 billion supranational bonds in AFS securities and $1.46 billion
supranational bonds in HTM securities.
Approximately 82% and 81% of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S.
debt securities was rated “AAA” or “AA” as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively. The majority of these securities comprised senior positions

and December 31, 2021, respectively, approximately 26% and 24% of the
aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate.
As of March 31, 2022, our non-U.S. debt securities had an average market-tobook ratio of 98.2%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized loss of $580 million,
composed of gross unrealized gains of $27 million and gross unrealized losses of
$607 million. These unrealized amounts included:
• a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $510 million, composed of gross unrealized
gains of $27 million and gross unrealized losses of $537
million, associated with non-U.S. AFS debt securities; and
• a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $70 million, composed of gross unrealized
losses of $70 million, associated with non-U.S. HTM debt securities.
As of March 31, 2022, the underlying collateral for non-U.S. MBS and ABS

were substantially composed of Japanese government securities.
Municipal Obligations
We carried approximately $1.20 billion of municipal securities classified as
state and political subdivisions in our investment securities portfolio as of March 31,
2022, as shown in Table 20: Carrying Values of Investment Securities, all of which
were classified as AFS. As of March 31, 2022, we also provided approximately

Fund finance loans include primarily $8,254 million private equity capital call finance loans, $6,555 million loans to real money
funds, $2,483 million collateralized loan obligations in loan form and $1,243 million loans to business development companies as
of March 31, 2022, compared to $9,147 million private equity capital call finance loans, $6,397 million loans to real money funds,
$2,913 million collateralized loan obligations in loan form and $1,387 million loans to business development companies as of
December 31, 2021.
Includes $1,529 million securities finance loans, $462 million loans to municipalities and $22 million other loans as of March 31,
2022 and $1,784 million securities finance loans, $455 million loans to municipalities and $23 million other loans as of
December 31, 2021.
As of March 31, 2022, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $25,781 million and fixed rate loans totaled
$2,615 million. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with LIBOR
indexed floating-rate loans. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data, in our 2021 Form 10-K for additional details.
The increase in foreign loans as of March 31, 2022 compared to December 31,
2021 was primarily driven by higher levels of client overdrafts.
As of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our leveraged loans
totaled approximately $4.43 billion. We sold $89 million of leveraged loans in the
first quarter of 2022, of which $51 million remained unsettled and was held for sale
as of March 31, 2022, (which was settled subsequently in April 2022).
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 of $155 million and $124 million, respectively, to participate in
syndications of
leveraged loans. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is
provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our
internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with
approximately 95% and 94% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of March 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally
limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global
financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential
investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment.
However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higherrated loans in our portfolio.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying
classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form
10-Q.
No loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both March 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021.

We recorded no provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2022, as
positive changes in the mix of loans in our portfolio were offset by a downward shift
in management's economic outlook, compared to a $9 million reserve release in the
same period in 2021.
As of March 31, 2022, approximately $61 million of our allowance for credit
losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial
segment compared to $92 million as of March 31, 2021. As our view on current and
future economic scenarios change, our allowance for credit losses related to these
loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit losses,
reflecting credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as changes in management's economic outlook as of year-end. The remaining $46 million and $43

million as of March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was related to other loans,
commercial real estate loans, off-balance sheet commitments and other financial
assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities.
An allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities upon
acquisition of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair value and expected
future cash flows of the investment securities are less than their amortized cost
basis. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of economic and
security-specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by
management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific
performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than management's
expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, the credit-related
component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would be recorded in the
provision for credit losses. Additional information with respect to the allowance for
credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses related to
investment securities, is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border Outstandings
Cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-U.S.
counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-local currency, as
well as non-U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. Our
cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease
financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related
to FX and interest rate contracts; and securities finance. In addition to credit risk,
cross-border outstandings carry the risk that, as a result of political or economic
conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual
repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the
unavailability of, or restrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their
obligations.
As market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit
rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and
sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant
counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we
rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. As a
result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative
ratings volatility.
The cross-border outstandings presented in Table 27: Cross-border
outstandings, represented approximately 23% and 27% of our consolidated total
assets as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

outstandings in France amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated

Risk Management
In the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a
variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific
to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses on material
risks, which include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risk, funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as
asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest rate
risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these
risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial
(1)

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
statements, are discussed in detail on pages 23 to 51 included under Item 1A, Risk
Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 83 to
88 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading
activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal
securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement
operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central
banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support certain on-balance sheet
credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortized cost. We also maintain
an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our offbalance sheet credit exposure. The two components together represent the
allowance for credit losses. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is
based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and
the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple
economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to
develop management's forecast of future expected losses.
The economic forecast utilized in the first quarter of 2022 reflects positive
changes in the mix of loans in our portfolio, offset by a downward shift in management's economic outlook. Allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and management may use qualitative adjustments.
If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our
allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2022, or if credit risk migration is higher
or lower than
forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for
credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management framework,
including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,
risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring
and controls, refer to pages 88 to 93 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our
activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidity risk
we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and
perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process
involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which
assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in
cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential
impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. We also manage
liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company, as well as at certain
branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has
access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds
market and the Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.
Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily
through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support
agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash
needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. Reference our
SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquid
assets available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company. As of
March 31, 2022, our Parent Company and State Street Bank had no senior notes or
subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management
activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including
interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international
regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance,
supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some
cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII
or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the
way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative
regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a
non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our
efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics, refer to pages 93 to 98 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk
Management, in our 2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity
ratios, including LCR and the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 14 included
under Item 1, Business, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to
improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid
securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. We report LCR to the
Federal Reserve daily. For the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, daily average LCR for the Parent Company was 106% and 105%,
respectively. The impact of higher deposits on the Parent Company's LCR is offset
by a cap, known as the transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street
Bank and Trust that can be recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the
U.S. LCR Final
Rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of liquidity under stress. The average HQLA for
the Parent Company under the LCR final rule definition was $151.57 billion and
$159.36 billion, post-prescribed haircuts, for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, LCR for
State Street Bank and Trust was approximately 127%. State Street Bank and Trust's
LCR is higher than the Parent Company's LCR, primarily due to application of the
transferability restriction in the LCR Final Rule to the calculation of the Parent
Company's LCR. This restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the
Parent Company's LCR to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking
subsidiary (State Street Bank and Trust). This transferability restriction does not
apply in the calculation of State Street Bank and Trust's LCR, and therefore State
Street Bank and Trust's LCR reflects the benefit of all of its HQLA holdings.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements
governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately $72.79 billion at the
Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter ended
March 31, 2022, and $83.48 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The
lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of
client deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without
corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the
FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the
FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against
high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. As of
both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings
from the FHLB.
Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities
is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying
conditions. As of both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no
outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other
central bank facility.
In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant
amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. These securities are
available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in
our asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $101.68 billion for
the quarter ended March 31, 2022, compared to $99.47 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of
client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to
clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan
portfolios; or other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise
under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of
our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post
collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our
enhanced custody program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $33.76 billion and $33.03 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $2.62 billion and $3.24 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of
March 31, 2022, approximately 75% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit
and 32% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our
commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross
contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit a
resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution
strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute
on that strategy in the event of major financial distress. Through resolution planning,
we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial
system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019 requires
a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the
relevant submission years. We submitted our updated 2021 targeted 165(d)
resolution plan by July 1, 2021. The targeted resolution plan included the core
elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information about the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on resolution planning. In addition, actions taken
to remediate the 2019 shortcoming related to the implementation of governance
mechanisms were included in the plan. Our next full resolution plan is due July 1,
2023.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred resolution strategy is
the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the
Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company,
SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as
defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available
resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other
entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State
Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary
Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the
recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent
Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a
newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of
the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by
contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,
investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other
cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the
support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent
available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has
agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the
Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent
Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations
and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has
provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may
issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue
to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a
"Recapitalization Event", which is defined under the support agreement as the
earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being
breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for
the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and
SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be
exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security
State Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF
would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary
Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the
Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary
Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that
identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be
made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds
are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and
liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support
that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market
confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement, (which specifically
exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential
bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to
the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and
(4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a
Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support
agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective
or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our
entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. We submitted our last
IDI plan before July 1, 2018. In November 2018, the FDIC had announced that until
the FDIC completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would be
required to be filed. On June 25, 2021, the FDIC issued a policy statement on
resolution plans for IDIs that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the
frequency of submissions to a three-year cycle. State Street Bank’s next IDI plan
submission deadline is December 1, 2023.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan to the Federal Reserve.
This plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be
implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress in those
entities. We also have recovery planning requirements in certain international
jurisdictions where we operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody, accounting,
administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset
management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of
these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally
provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place
deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, approximately 65% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 10% in the British pound Sterling (GBP)
and 10% in all other currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of
the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by
pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset
Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of
liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold
under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature,
generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.
These balances were $4.28 billion and $1.58 billion as of March 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively.
State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution
of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.12 billion, as of March 31, 2022, to
support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no
stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of both
March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was no balance outstanding on this
line of credit.
State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business
needs. The total amount remaining for issuance under the registration statement is
$2.25 billion as of March 31, 2022. In addition, State Street Bank also has current
authorization from the Board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt.
On February 7, 2022, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of
fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026, $650 million aggregate principal
amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2028 and $550 million aggregate
principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2033.
On March 30, 2022, we redeemed $750 million aggregate principal amount of
2.825% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023.
On April 14, 2022, we notified the holders of our $750 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.653% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023 that we
will redeem all of the Notes on May 15, 2022.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the
maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major
independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit
ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client
deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer
products;
• serving markets; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
A downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which
could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and
large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
draw-downs of unfunded
commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase
commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading
derivative contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral
agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate
the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of
these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by all rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination payments
related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have
been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings
below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as secured
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit
triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Tight labor markets, the ongoing war in Ukraine and lingering impacts from the
COVID-19 pandemic are resulting in stress on the operating environment and have
increased, and may continue to increase, operational risk. The war in Ukraine also
heightens information technology risk exposures, including cyber-threats. See also
“Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages
99 to 102 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in
our 2021 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information
technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology noncompliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents,
business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology
operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 102 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K - "Any failures of or damage to,
attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities
or disruptions to our continuous operations, including the systems, facilities or
operations of third parties with which we do business, such as resulting from cyberattacks, could result in significant costs, reputational damage and limits on our
ability to conduct our business activities".
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or assetand-liability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is
provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk
associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate
risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of
which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity
needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against
those factors.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Market
Risk Management" in our 2021 Form 10-K.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into
derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign
exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward
contracts and interest rate futures. As of March 31, 2022, the notional amount of
these derivative contracts was $2.57 trillion, of which $2.53 trillion was composed of
foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions
closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All
foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,
which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical
confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR,
and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk
requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a
one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to
calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of
continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The
stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in
the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR
meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that
is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial
stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking
the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from
within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial
crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011.
As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time,
future market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and
methodologies, refer to pages 105 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Valueat-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2021 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of
adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing
on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market
conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading
desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC).
Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the CMRC if material. In addition, we have
established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of
estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which
excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions,
changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
We had one back-testing exception in the quarter ended March 31, 2022, one back-testing exception in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and no back-testing exceptions
in the quarter ended March 31, 2021. At a 99% confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to
three exceptions per year).
The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended March 31, 2022, December 31,
2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of
the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The three month average of our stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $36 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, compared to an average of approximately
$40 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 and $45 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in the average stressed VaR for the quarter ended March
31, 2022, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2021, is primarily attributed to lower foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading
activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction in VaR
measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,
and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.
The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of
March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the
VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate
risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and
liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic
value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits
generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio
positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our
baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 32, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts
at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021. Our March 31, 2022 baseline forecast aligns to the market’s expectations for a rapid increase in global central bank rates in response to
rising inflation. In addition to higher interest rates, we are also forecasting gradual deposit balance reductions and increasing deposit betas as a result of quantitative tightening and
rising interest rates.

This reflects our internal interest rate forecast as of March 31, 2022.
In Table 33: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve,
including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rates changes on our financial
performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our
deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the
result is negative interest rates.

The short-end is 0-3 months. The long-end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.
As of March 31, 2022, NII is expected to benefit from an increase in interest rates. Compared to March 31, 2021, NII is less sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily due
to improvement in our NII from recent rate increases in our baseline forecast and the benefit of additional U.S. rate hikes beginning to diminish due to higher deposit betas. Our
current simulations assume that deposit betas are higher than the last U.S. rising rate cycle from 2017-2018 due to our current deposit mix and the pacing of U.S. rate hikes
occurring over a shorter period of time. With the change to our baseline interest rate forecast, which assumes a sharp rise in central bank rates, NII is now exposed to lower interest
rate scenarios. As our baseline outlook for NII improves over the next twelve-month period, lower rate scenarios relative to our baseline view highlight the NII at risk if the baseline
rate outlook is not realized.
As previously disclosed, during periods when U.S. interest rates are near zero, NII is more sensitive to short-end U.S. rate changes, primarily due to impacts on our
sponsored repurchase agreement activity. When U.S. market rates shift higher and away from zero, our sponsored repurchase agreement activity’s NII sensitivity is reduced to
normalized levels which are included in our higher rate scenarios.
NII sensitivity is routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Risk Management”.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry,
with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support
numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models
contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial
management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model
results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect
on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework
seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management framework,
including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 111 to 112 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or
capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of
strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic
risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market
performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary
impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit,
operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our
assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.
The Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, in conjunction with
the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), ceased the publication of
GBP, EUR, Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen LIBOR settings for all tenors, as well
as one week and two months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. It
announced that on June 30, 2023, it would cease the publication of overnight and
twelve months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and that the 1 month, 3 month and 6
month USD LIBOR setting would become non-representative.
We have established a process to identify, assess, plan for and remediate the
use of LIBOR and other reference rates affected by reference rate reform that
addresses both direct exposures on our balance sheet, and, more importantly, the
use of LIBOR in our various service provider roles to our customers. This process is
led by a wide, multidisciplinary LIBOR program management office (“LIBOR PMO”),
established in September 2018, that
will continue to lead our transition efforts through June 2023.
The LIBOR PMO reports regularly to executive management of the firm and
our key regulators on progress with respect to client communications, updating
quantitative models and information technology systems, managing vendors,
contracts remediation, adoption of alternative reference rates for various financial
products and services, evaluation of fallback provisions contained in LIBOR-priced
loans, investment securities, derivatives and long-term debt and general operational
readiness for each stage of the transition. Most of the work identified by the LIBOR
PMO for implementation of the transition is substantially complete, and contingency
plans have been developed with respect to identified uncertainties. No incremental
material investments are expected to be needed for systems and processes related
to the transition. Potential risks that could impact our remediation efforts include
overall transition readiness across the industry, third party vendor dependencies
and resource constraints from the concentration of remediation activities at key
points in the transition process.
Our direct on balance sheet exposures to LIBOR are limited and primarily
include assets held in the investment portfolio, certain loans made through Global
Credit Finance and issuances of long-term debt and preferred stock. We have
planned for, and are prepared to, transition our remaining on balance sheet
exposures in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and the availability of
interim solutions for various legacy LIBOR contracts. We will not originate or issue
new LIBOR-based loans or long-term debt, and any purchases of LIBOR-based
investment securities will be screened for adequate fallback language. Our
remaining exposure outstanding at June 2023 is largely governed by existing
fallback language, or jurisdictional legislation that provides for appropriate fallback
provisions. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to
market changes promptly, while avoiding increased related expenses or operational
errors. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition
away from the use of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark used to determine
amounts payable under, and the value of, relevant financial instruments and
contracts.
For additional information about our strategic risk management framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 112 to 113 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Strategic Risk Management", in our 2021 Form 10-K, and page 44 included under
Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2021 Form 10-K - "The market transition away from

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
an interest rate benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may expose us
to increased operational, model and financial risk."
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial
flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own
internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by
banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge
above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all
other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to
the required minimum of 3% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any
regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and
discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or
financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be
subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 113 to 121 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market
risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators.
The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital
adequacy: the “standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches", applicable
to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach
prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk
weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches
consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of
RWA related to credit risk, and the
Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to
operational risk.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 and the SCB rule enacted
in 2020, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the
assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation
buffer (CCB) and the SCB, for the advanced approaches and standardized
approach, respectively, and a countercyclical capital buffer. In addition, we are
subject to a G-SIB surcharge. Our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory
assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced
approaches and standardized approach.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation
buffer with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and
lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus
planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the
fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement
can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or
surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and
discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The countercyclical capital
buffer is currently set at zero by U.S. banking regulators.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2022, include a CCB of
2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach,
respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This
results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2023, is 1.0%. Based on
a calculation as of December 31, 2021, our G-SIB surcharge beginning January 1,
2024 could increase to 1.5%. Accordingly, we have developed a balance sheet
management plan intended to result in a G-SIB surcharge calculation of 1.0% as of
December 31, 2022 which, if effective, would result in our maintaining our current GSIB surcharge of 1.0% through December 31, 2024.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company,
we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other
requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by
the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and
quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative and quantitative information
required by the rule is provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. We are subject to the
more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital
adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

 Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk-based deductions.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial
condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory
review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
 Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%.

As of March 31, 2022, total advanced approaches RWA increased $3.57 billion compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by an increase in credit risk RWA. The increase
in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by a net increase in OTC derivatives exposures and all other RWA, partially offset by investment securities-wholesale RWA.
As of March 31, 2022, total standardized approach RWA increased $15.06 billion compared to December 31, 2021, mainly driven by an increase in credit risk RWA. The
increase in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by the implementation of SA-CCR, as expected, as well as a temporary deployment of RWA capital for revenue generating activities
in our markets businesses.
The regulatory capital ratios as of March 31, 2022, presented in Table 34: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the
advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with
respect to our capital and related matters as of March 31, 2022, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions,
collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual
report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually
or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events
experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing
regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a
material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.
An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the
severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation
to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us
or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will
change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III
final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a supplementary
leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted
quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the
SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly
average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance
sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company
requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, is intended to improve the
resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced
prudential standards, and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD)
and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a GSIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable counter- cyclical
buffer, which is currently 0%); and
• 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the
SLR buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the SLR final rule.
Qualifying external LTD
Greater of:
• 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB surcharge
calculated for these purposes under method 2 of 1.0%);
and
• 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR
final rule.
As of April 1, 2020, the TLAC and LTD requirements calibrated to the SLR
denominator reflect the deduction of certain central bank balances as prescribed by
the regulatory relief implemented under EGRRCPA.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Regulatory Developments
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace
the current 2.0% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB
surcharge. This proposal would also make conforming modifications to our TLAC
and eligible LTD requirements applicable to G-SIBs. At this point in time, it is unclear
whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed.
In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies issued a final rule that, among other things, implemented the standardized
approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), a methodology for calculating the
exposure amount for derivative contracts. Under the final rule, which became
effective on January 1, 2022, we have the option to use the SA-CCR or the Internal
Model Methodology (IMM) to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and
uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation. We
have elected to use the SA-CCR for purposes of our advanced approaches capital
calculations. We are required to determine the amount of these exposures using the
SA-CCR under our standardized approach capital calculation. Additionally, we have
to apply a revised formula to determine the RWA amount of our central counterparty
default fund contributions. The adoption of the SA-CCR, in place of then-applicable
Current Exposure Method (CEM), resulted in an 8% increase in our standardized
RWA as of March 31, 2022. As part of a plan to partially offset this impact, various
optimization actions are being implemented across business lines with an expected
completion in the first half of 2022.
On March 4, 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued the SCB final rule
that replaces, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation buffer
(2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between an institution’s starting and
lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus
planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the
fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. Based on our results
from the 2021 supervisory stress test, our SCB for the period of October 1, 2021
through September 2022 is set at the minimum of 2.5% of RWA.
The Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an
interim final rule effective in March 2020 and later finalized on a permanent basis on
August 26, 2020, which revised the definition of eligible retained income for all U.S.
banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible
retained income makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions, where a
banking organization's regulatory ratios were to decline below the respective
minimum requirements, take effect on a more gradual basis.
On March 27, 2020, the BCBS announced the deferral of the implementation
of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023. As of now, the U.S.
federal banking agencies have not formally proposed the implementation of the
BCBS revisions.
Effective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes a deduction for
qualifying central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization’s total
leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial
banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying
central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial
banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping
accounts. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we deducted $73.8 billion of
average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the
calculation of our SLR, based on this custodial banking deduction.
On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies issued a final rule that requires us and State Street Bank to make certain
deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt
instruments, including eligible LTD under the TLAC rule, issued by the Parent
Company and other U.S. and foreign G-SIBs. The final rule became effective on
April 1, 2021.
Our SCB requirement was 2.5% for the period from October 1, 2020 through
September 30, 2021. On June 24, 2021, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of
the results from the 2021 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the
2021 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB
at that floor, which was effective starting October 1, 2021 and will run through
September 30, 2022. The Federal Reserve also lifted the restrictions on capital
distributions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we are
currently governed in our capital distributions by minimum capital requirements
inclusive of SCB.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 113 to 121 included

Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Common Stock
In September 2021, we completed a public offering of approximately 21.7 million shares of our common stock. The offering price was $87.60 per share and net proceeds totaled
approximately $1.9 billion. We expect to use these net proceeds to finance our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business.
In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to
resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021. We repurchased $475 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our Board authorized a common
share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $425 million of our common stock through June 30, 2021, in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. We
repurchased $425 million of our common stock in the second quarter of 2021. In July 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion
of our common stock through the end of 2022.
In connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business, we did not repurchase any common stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and
during the first quarter of 2022 under the common

share repurchase plan approved by our Board in July 2021. We no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second and third quarters of 2022 due primarily to
net unrealized losses on AFS securities reported in Other Comprehensive Income in the first quarter of 2022 related to higher interest rates.

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 54 to 56 in "Related
Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in our 2021 Form 10-K,
and to pages 169 to 171 in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration,
timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and
may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction will depend on several factors, including investment
opportunities, our capital position, our financial performance, market conditions and the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common
share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our
clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of
these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $395.51 billion and
$385.74 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of
the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement
of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the
borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $415.61 billion and $404.12 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we
indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100%
of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. Of the collateral of $415.61 billion and $404.12 billion, referenced above, $65.85 billion and $61.56 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements
as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We or our agents held $71.43 billion and $67.01 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase
agreements as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements

For more information on our market risk refer to pages 103 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2021 Form 10-K. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2022. We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, no change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
