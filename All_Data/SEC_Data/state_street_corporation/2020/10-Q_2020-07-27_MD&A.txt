 

GENERAL 

State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 (Form 10-Q), unless the context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street Bank, we provide a broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide , with $33.52 trillion of AUC/A and $3.05 trillion of AUM as of June 30, 2020 . 

As of June 30, 2020 , we had consolidated total assets of $280.24 billion , consolidated total deposits of $200.46 billion , consolidated total shareholders' equity of $24.87 billion and 39,068 employees. We operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. 

Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided. 

Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of the Form 10-Q and updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 previously filed with the SEC (2019 Form 10-K). You should read the financial information contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q in conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our 2019 Form 10-K . Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses. 

&#160;

The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include: 

&#8226; 

accounting for fair value measurements; 

&#8226; 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; 

&#8226; 

contingencies; and 

&#8226; 

allowance for credit losses. 

These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available. For additional information about these significant accounting policies refer to pages 115 to 117, &#8220;Significant Accounting Estimates&#8221; included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K and Significant Accounting Estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q. Upon evaluating our accounting policies in light of our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we included allowance for credit losses as one of our significant accounting policies. Other than including that additional significant policy, we did not change these significant accounting policies in the first six months of 2020 . 

Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis. We measure and compare certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management uses in evaluating our business and activities. 

Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP-basis measure. 

We further believe that our presentation of FTE NII, a non-GAAP measure, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a FTE basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends. 

We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading activities) and the LCR, summary results of semi-annual State Street-run stress

tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan disclosures required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional disclosures are accessible on the &#8220;Investor Relations&#8221; section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com . 

We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q. 

We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us under the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other public statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in our Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as applicable) that are considered &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of U.S. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, client growth and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry, governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts. 

Terminology such as &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;forecast,&#8221; &#8220;outlook,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;priority,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;strategy&#8221; and &#8220;goal,&#8221; or similar statements or variations of such terms, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms. 

Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which change over time, are based on management's expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the equity , debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could cause changes in the expectations or 

&#160;

assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

the financial strength of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposures or to which our clients have such exposures as a result of our acting as agent, including as an asset manager or securities lending agent; 

&#8226; 

the significant risks and uncertainties for our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and other regulatory requirements in the United States and internationally, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which will depend on several factors, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, its influence on the economy and financial markets, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements and staffing levels in operational facilities, challenges associated with our return to office plans such as maintaining a safe office environment and integrating at-home and in-office staff, the impact of market participants on which we rely and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the impact of lower equity market valuations on our service and management fee revenue; 

&#8226; 

increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our NII; changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities); and changes in the manner in which we fund those assets; 

&#8226; 

the volatility of servicing fee, management fee, trading fee and securities finance revenues due to, among other factors, the value of equity and fixed-income markets, market interest and FX rates, the volume of client transaction activity, competitive pressures in the investment servicing and asset management industries, and the timing of revenue recognition with respect to software and processing fees revenues; 

&#8226; 

the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits; the liquidity of the assets on our balance sheet and changes or volatility in the sources of such funding, particularly the deposits of our clients; and demands upon our liquidity, including the liquidity demands and requirements of our clients; 

&#8226; 

the level, volatility and uncertainty of interest rates; the expected discontinuation of Interbank Offered Rates including London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR); the valuation of the U.S. dollar relative to

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses; the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally on prevailing rates of interest and currency exchange rates in the markets in which we provide services to our clients; 

&#8226; 

the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to impairment of such securities and the recognition of a provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of income; 

&#8226; 

our ability to attract and retain deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding; our ability to manage the level and pricing of such deposits and the relative portion of our deposits that are determined to be operational under regulatory guidelines; our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity needs, regulatory requirements and risk profile; and the risks associated with the potential liquidity mismatch between short-term deposit funding and longer term investments; 

&#8226; 

the manner and timing with which the Federal Reserve and other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators implement or reevaluate the regulatory framework applicable to our operations (as well as changes to that framework), including implementation or modification of the Dodd-Frank Act and related stress testing and resolution planning requirements and implementation of international standards applicable to financial institutions, such as those proposed by the Basel Committee and European legislation (such as Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) V, the Money Market Fund Regulation and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II/Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation); among other consequences, these regulatory changes impact the levels of regulatory capital, long-term debt and liquidity we must maintain, acceptable levels of credit exposure to third parties, margin requirements applicable to derivatives, restrictions on banking and financial activities and the manner in which we structure and implement our global operations and servicing relationships. In addition, our regulatory posture and related expenses have been and will continue to be affected by heightened standards and changes in regulatory expectations for global systemically important financial institutions applicable to, among other things, risk management, liquidity and capital planning, cyber-security, resiliency, resolution planning and compliance programs, as well as changes in 

&#160;

governmental enforcement approaches to perceived failures to comply with regulatory or legal obligations; 

&#8226; 

adverse changes in the regulatory ratios that we are, or will be, required to meet, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act or implementation of international standards applicable to financial institutions, such as those proposed by the Basel Committee, or due to changes in regulatory positions, practices or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital or liquidity ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period; 

&#8226; 

requirements to obtain the prior approval or non-objection of the Federal Reserve or other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or corporate activities, including, without limitation, acquisitions, investments in subsidiaries, dividends and stock repurchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, share repurchase programs or other capital or corporate initiatives may be restricted; 

&#8226; 

geopolitical risks applicable to our operations and activities in jurisdictions globally, including emerging markets and economies, that have the potential to disrupt or impose costs, delays or damages upon our, our clients', our counterparties' and suppliers' and our infrastructure providers' respective operations, activities and strategic planning and to compromise financial markets and stability; 

&#8226; 

changes in law or regulation, or the enforcement of law or regulation, that may adversely affect our business activities or those of our clients or our counterparties, and the products or services that we sell, including, without limitation, additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements, margin requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to our operating model and the adequacy and resiliency of our controls or compliance programs; 

&#8226; 

a cyber-security incident, or a failure to protect our systems and our, our clients' and others' information against cyber-attacks, could result in the theft, loss, unauthorized access to, disclosure, use or alteration of information, system failures, or loss of access to information; any such incident or failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses, potentially materially; 

&#8226; 

our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of 

State Street Corporation | 6 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

our operations and our dependencies on information technology; to replace and consolidate systems, particularly those relying upon older technology, and to adequately incorporate cyber-security, resiliency and business continuity into our operations, information technology infrastructure and systems management; to implement robust management processes into our technology development and maintenance programs; and to control risks related to use of technology, including cyber-crime and inadvertent data disclosures; 

&#8226; 

our ability to identify and address threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems (including those of our third-party service providers); the effectiveness of our and our third party service providers' efforts to manage the resiliency of the systems on which we rely; controls regarding the access to, and integrity of, our and our clients' data; and complexities and costs of protecting the security of such systems and data; 

&#8226; 

our ability to control operational and resiliency risks, data security breach risks and outsourcing risks; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business; and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; 

&#8226; 

economic or financial market disruptions in the U.S. or internationally, including those which may result from recessions or political instability; for example, the United Kingdom's (U.K.) exit from the European Union or actual or potential changes in trade policy, such as tariffs or bilateral and multilateral trade agreements; 

&#8226; 

our ability to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients, any failure of which, in whole or in part, may among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost-effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment; 

&#8226; 

our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight, ethical behavior and governance that meets our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators, and the financial, regulatory, reputational and other consequences of our failure to meet such expectations; 

&#8226; 

the impact on our compliance and controls enhancement programs associated with the appointment of a monitor under the deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and compliance consultant appointed under a settlement with the SEC, including the potential for such monitor and compliance consultant to 

&#160;

require changes to our programs or to identify other issues that require substantial expenditures, changes in our operations, payments to clients or reporting to U.S. authorities; 

&#8226; 

the results of our review of our billing practices, including additional findings or amounts we may be required to reimburse clients, as well as potential consequences of such review, including damage to our client relationships or our reputation, adverse actions or penalties imposed by governmental authorities and costs associated with remediation of identified deficiencies; 

&#8226; 

the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or civil or criminal proceedings; 

&#8226; 

changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose; 

&#8226; 

the large institutional clients on which we focus are often able to exert considerable market influence and have diverse investment activities, and this, combined with strong competitive market forces, subjects us to significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge, to potentially significant changes in our AUC/A or our AUM in the event of the acquisition or loss of a client, in whole or in part, and to potentially significant changes in our revenue in the event a client re-balances or changes its investment approach, re-directs assets to lower- or higher-fee asset classes or changes the mix of products or services that it receives from us; 

&#8226; 

the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds; 

&#8226; 

the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent; the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools and the potential that clients will seek to hold us liable for such losses; and the possibility that our clients or regulators will assert claims that our fees, with respect to such investment products, are not appropriate; 

&#8226; 

our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; 

&#8226; 

the credit agency ratings of our debt and depositary obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength; 

&#8226; 

adverse publicity, whether specific to us or regarding other industry participants or industry-wide factors, or other reputational harm; 

&#8226; 

changes or potential changes to the competitive

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

environment, due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of us, as a suitable service provider or counterparty; 

&#8226; 

our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, including, without limitation, our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; 

&#8226; 

the risks that our acquired businesses, including, without limitation, our acquisition of CRD, and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial, operational and product innovation benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated; that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative synergies or liabilities will be experienced; that client and deposit retention goals will not be met; that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced; and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators; 

&#8226; 

our ability to integrate CRD's front office software solutions with our middle and back office capabilities to develop our front-to-middle-to-back office State Street Alpha that is competitive, generates revenues in line with our expectations and meets our clients' requirements; the dependency of State Street Alpha on enhancements to our data management and the risks to our servicing model associated with increased exposure to client data; 

&#8226; 

our ability to recognize evolving needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us; the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer; and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; 

&#8226; 

our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations; 

&#8226; 

changes in accounting standards and practices; and 

&#8226; 

the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due. 

Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our other SEC filings. 

&#160;

Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made. The factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions, and should not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K, or registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com .

More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including comparisons of our financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 to the same periods in 2019 , is provided under &#8220;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8221;, "Line of Business Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . In this Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in FX rates, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted average FX rates from the relevant 2019 period to the relevant 2020 period results. 

Financial Results and Highlights 

&#8226; 

EPS of $1.86 in the second quarter of 2020 increased 31% compared to $1.42 in the same period in 2019 . 

&#8226; 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actions we took to support our clients, the financial markets and the broader economy, is reflected in our results for the second quarter and first six months of 2020. 

&#9702; 

This includes accommodating higher than usual U.S. client deposits; and 

&#9702; 

an increase in FX trading services revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. 

&#9702; 

Operationally, we maintained business continuity, resiliency and operational effectiveness with approximately 90% of our global employees working from home through the end of the quarter. 

&#9702; 

We continued to onboard new clients and managed elevated transaction volumes amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#9702; 

We actively assisted clients with access to various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit. We supported our clients' liquidity needs by processing nearly 50% of the value of commercial paper sold under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) and are custodian and administrator for four Federal Reserve programs: Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Main Street Lending Program, and Primary and Secondary Markets Corporate Credit Facilities.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

&#9702; 

On March 16, 2020, we announced, together with the other U.S. based G-SIBs, that we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second quarter of 2020 . In addition, we will not repurchase any common stock in the third quarter of 2020 under current Federal Reserve requirements. 

&#8226; 

The impact of notable items in both the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $12 million of acquisition and restructuring costs, primarily related to CRD. 

&#8226; 

In the second quarter of 2020 , return on equity of 12.1% increased from 10.1% in the same period in 2019 , primarily due to an increase in net income available to common shareholders. Pre-tax margin of 27.3% in the second quarter of 2020 increased from 25.0% in the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher total revenue and lower expenses. 

&#8226; 

Operating leverage was 5.5% in the second quarter of 2020 . Operating leverage represents the difference between the percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period. 

&#8226; 

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve released results from the 2020 CCAR submission, which included preliminary SCB requirements for the twelve months starting October 1, 2020. We were notified by the Federal Reserve that our preliminary SCB is 2.5%, implying no change to our regulatory capital requirements at this time. The Federal Reserve will provide each participating CCAR bank organization with its final SCB by August 31, 2020. Due to the economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all participating CCAR banks will be required to resubmit their capital plans within 45 days after the Federal Reserve provides updated scenarios. In line with the decision to administer a new stress test, the Federal Reserve is limiting the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to distribute capital during the third quarter of 2020 beyond common dividends at their current levels. 

Revenue 

&#8226; 

Total revenue and fee revenue increased 2% and 5% , respectively, in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily driven by increases in servicing fees, foreign exchange trading services and 

&#160;

software and processing fees, partially offset by lower management fees and securities finance revenues and, in the case of total revenue, by a decline in NII. 

&#8226; 

Servicing fee revenue increased 2% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher client activity and net new business, partially offset by moderating pricing headwinds. 

&#8226; 

Management fee revenue decreased 4% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to institutional net outflows, partially offset by net inflows from cash and ETFs, particularly in SPDR&#174; Portfolio and Sector ETFs. 

&#8226; 

Foreign exchange trading services increased 26% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily reflecting significantly elevated FX volume and volatility. 

&#8226; 

Securities finance revenue decreased 27% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to decreases in enhanced custody balances due to client deleveraging and lower agency lending revenues due to a mix shift to fixed income assets and lower spreads . 

&#8226; 

Software and processing fees revenue increased 46% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to revenue associated with a significant CRD wealth client implementation and several client renewals, as well as market-related adjustments. 

&#8226; 

CRD contributed approximately $138 million and $61 million in total revenue and total expenses, respectively, in the second quarter of 2020 , compared to $87 million and $46 million , respectively, in the same period in 2019 . In addition, CRD-related expenses include $16 million and $17 million in amortization of other intangible assets in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 , respectively. CRD revenue with affiliated entities, which is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements, was $7 million and $4 million for the second quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

&#8226; 

NII decreased 9% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to the impact of lower market rates, partially offset by higher deposit balances and our support for our clients' liquidity needs through the MMLF program. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

&#8226; 

In the second quarter of 2020 , we recorded a provision for credit losses related to loans and 

State Street Corporation | 10 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities held-to-maturity and off-balance sheet commitments of $52 million based on the CECL methodology, adopted January 1, 2020. This reflects portfolio credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as a downward revision in management's economic outlook as of quarter-end reflecting the impact of COVID-19. 

&#8226; 

The second quarter provision compares to a $1 million provision for credit losses in the same period in 2019 (which was under the previous incurred loss model). 

Expenses 

&#8226; 

Total expenses decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily reflecting on-going expense management initiatives. 

AUC/A and AUM 

&#8226; 

AUC/A increased 2% as of June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019 , primarily due to higher period-end market levels and client flows, partially offset by a previously announced client transition. In the second quarter of 2020 , newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $162 billion . Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $1.04 trillion as of June 30, 2020 . 

&#8226; 

AUM increased 5% as of June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019 , primarily due to net inflows from cash and ETFs and higher period-end equity market levels, partially offset by institutional outflows. 

Capital 

&#8226; 

In the second quarter of 2020 , we returned a total of approximately $183 million to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends. 

&#9702; 

We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.52 per share, totaling $183 million in the second quarter of 2020 , compared to $0.47 per share, totaling $175 million in the same period in 2019 , representing an increase of approximately 11% on a per share basis. 

&#9702; 

We had no repurchases of our common stock in the second quarter of 2020 under current Federal Reserve's requirements. In the second quarter of 2019 , we acquired 4.6 million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $65.25 and an aggregate cost of approximately $300 million . 

&#160;

&#8226; 

Our binding CET1 capital ratio was 12.3% as of June 30, 2020 compared to 11.7% as of December 31, 2019 , driven by higher retained earnings and a reduction in RWA, with significant headroom above the applicable regulatory requirement. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 6.1% as of June 30, 2020 , compared to 6.9% as of December 31, 2019 , primarily due to increased leverage assets in the second quarter of 2020 . Our standardized approach capital ratios were binding as of June 30, 2020 . 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q .

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Fee Revenue 

Table 2: Total Revenue , provides the breakout of fee revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . Servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 71% and 72% of total fee revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to 75% and 74% in the same periods in 2019, respectively. 

Servicing Fee Revenue 

Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. On average and over time, approximately 55% of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another 15% of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values. 

Changes in Market Valuations 

Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients&#8217; portfolios. 

Over the five years ended December 31, 2019 , we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (2)% to 5% annually. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented. 

We estimate, using relevant information as of June 30, 2020 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that: 

&#8226; 

A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 3% ; and 

&#8226; 

A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues , on average and over time, of approximately 1% .

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Client Activity and Asset Flows 

Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities. 

Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five years ended December 31, 2019 , we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 2% annually. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

Pricing 

The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially. On average, over the five years ended December 31, 2019 , we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the terms of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client investment practices. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients. 

Net New Business 

Over the five years ended December 31, 2019 , net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually. 

New business impacting servicing fees can include: custody; product and participant level accounting; daily valuation and administration; record-keeping; cash management; and other services. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed. 

Management Fee Revenue 

Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and UCITS, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients. In addition, in a prolonged low-interest-rate environment, such as we are currently experiencing, we have waived and may in the future waive certain fees for our clients for money market products. 

Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee of AUM than for actively managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance. 

In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of June 30, 2020 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that: 

&#8226; 

A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 5% ; and 

&#8226; 

A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed-income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues , on average and over time, of approximately 4% . 

Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Quarter-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. 

Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line of Business Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Net Interest Income 

See Table 2: Total Revenue , for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. 

NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, resale agreements, loans and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. 

NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates. 

NII on a FTE basis decreased in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to lower U.S. market rates, partially offset by higher U.S. average client deposit balances and investment portfolio (including MMLF) and loan growth. 

Investment securities net premium amortization, which is included in interest income, was $109 million and $217 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $113 million and $202 million in the same periods in 2019 , respectively, primarily related to higher MBS premium amortization offset by discount accretion on MMLF HTM securities. 

Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments when they occur, such that the level rate of return remains constant throughout the contractual life of the security.

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility 

In March 2020, in response to the economic impact of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve established the MMLF program in order to enhance the liquidity and functioning of crucial money markets. Through the establishment of the MMLF program, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston makes loans available to eligible financial institutions secured by high-quality assets purchased by the financial institution from money market mutual funds. The MMLF program is authorized through September 30, 2020 and is to cease operations thereafter unless an extension is made. We are supporting our clients' liquidity needs through this program, following its adoption on March 18, 2020. As a result of the asset purchases (including negotiable CDs, municipals and asset-backed commercial paper), our participation in the facility grew to $19.0 billion on average in the second quarter of 2020 , and earned $12 million of NII. The purchases are match funded through Federal Reserve borrowings and the assets are posted as collateral. The borrowing is non-recourse, meaning that the Federal Reserve has taken on the credit risk of the assets purchased. The purchased securities are classified as held-to-maturity and have a maturity of less than 12 months. MMLF related assets do not impact our risk-based and leverage capital ratios.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . 

Average total interest-earning assets were $244.79 billion and $225.71 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $179.80 billion and $179.46 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. The increase is primarily driven by higher average total deposits and our participation in the MMLF program. 

Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $86.74 billion and $76.93 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $48.07 billion and $48.46 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. These deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits. 

Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $3.34 billion and $2.57 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $1.98 billion and $2.37 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. The impact of balance sheet netting increased to $103.15 billion and $113.56 billion on average in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively , compared to $74.80 billion and $67.04 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. We maintain an agreement with Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. The increase in average balance sheet netting, in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 , is primarily due to the expansion of our FICC program and new client activity. 

We have been a netting and sponsoring member within FICC since 2005. FICC expanded the service in 2017, and since then, we have increased our participation. We enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients&#8217; respective obligations. We obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality 

&#160;

securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC. 

Average investment securities, excluding MMLF HTM securities, increased to $97.59 billion and $96.55 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, from $89.93 billion and $89.11 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively, primarily driven by higher MBS balances. 

Loans averaged $27.37 billion and $27.92 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $23.82 billion and $23.44 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged $22.55 billion and $22.36 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , compared to $19.97 billion and $19.55 billion in the same periods in 2019 . 

Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, decreased to $9.83 billion and $10.30 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 from $15.10 billion and $15.20 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively, primarily driven by a reduction in the level of cash collateral posted related to client deleveraging. Enhanced custody is our securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance revenue. The NII earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments. 

Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $158.07 billion and $151.33 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, from $127.81 billion and $126.07 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. Interest bearing deposits totaled $158.33 billion as of June 30, 2020 compared to $147.84 billion as of December 31, 2019. Average U.S. interest-bearing deposits increased as a result of the market uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of global interest rates and new deposit gathering initiatives. We expect deposits to remain elevated in the current low interest rate environment. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior and market conditions, including the levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates. 

Average other short-term borrowings, typically associated with our tax-exempt investment program, increased to $3.07 billion and $3.02 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, from $2.04 billion and $1.60 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. 

Average long-term debt was $15.57 billion and $14.43 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $11.23 billion and $11.09 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. 

State Street Corporation | 17 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

These amounts reflect issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods. 

Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $3.46 billion and $3.45 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $3.98 billion and $4.31 billion in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. 

Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend. 

Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

In January 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as CECL methodology . The impact of transitioning to ASC 326 on the consolidated financial statements was an increase in the allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $3 million as of January 1, 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, we recorded a provision for credit losses related to loans and financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities held-to-maturity and off-balance sheet commitments of $52 million based on the CECL methodology, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 driven changes in our economic outlook as of quarter-end as well as negative portfolio credit migration. This compares to a $1 million provision for credit losses in the same period in 2019 (which was under the previous incurred loss model). Additional information is provided under &#8220;Loans&#8221; in "Financial Condition" in this

Compensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 3% and 2% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to lower salaries and headcount, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses. 

State Street Corporation | 18 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Total headcount decreased by approximately 1% as of June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019, primarily driven by productivity savings, including a reduction in headcount in higher cost locations. 

Information systems and communications expenses increased 3% and 5% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 . The increase was primarily related to software costs and technology infrastructure enhancements, partially offset by vendor savings. 

Transaction processing services expenses decreased 5% in the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily reflecting lower market data costs and sub-custody savings. Transaction processing services expenses were flat in the six months ended June 30, 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily reflecting lower vendor costs and transaction volume, partially offset by higher broker fees due to higher FX volumes. 

Occupancy expenses decreased 5% and 6% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to the advancement of our global optimization footprint strategy. 

Amortization of other intangible assets decreased 2% and 3% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 . 

Other expenses decreased 11% and 14% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily driven by lower marketing spend and travel costs, partially offset by higher professional fees. 

In April 2020, we announced that we were deferring most planned headcount reductions through the end of 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our planned actions will take place following that period. 

Acquisition Costs 

We recorded approximately $12 million and $23 million of acquisition costs in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $10 million and $23 million in the same periods in 2019 , respectively, related to our acquisition of CRD. As we integrate CRD into our business, we expect to incur a total of approximately $200 million of acquisition costs, including merger and integration costs, through 2021, out of which $133 million has been incurred as of June 30, 2020 , since the acquisition.

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $109 million and $249 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $131 million and $258 million in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. Our effective tax rate was 13.6% and 15.8% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to 18.1% and 19.0% in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2020 includes a decrease in a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits.

Servicing Fees 

Servicing fees, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results , increased 2% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to higher client activity and net new business, partially offset by moderating pricing headwinds. FX rates negatively impacted servicing fees by 1% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , compared to 1% and 2% in the same periods in 2019, respectively. 

Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% and 46% of total servicing fees in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to approximately 47% for both of the same periods in 2019 .

(1) Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix. 

Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the second quarter of 2020 totaled approximately $162 billion . Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $1.04 trillion as of June 30, 2020 , which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized over several quarters as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period. 

New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their 

&#160;

relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant. 

With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, FX, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency and wealth management services. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets. 

For additional information about the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to "Fee Revenue" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

Foreign Exchange Trading Services 

Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results , increased 30% and 53% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to significantly elevated FX volume and heightened FX volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign exchange trading services is composed of revenue generated by FX trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 63% and 37% , respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the second quarter of 2020 and 69% and 31% , respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2020. 

We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading&#8221; and &#8220;indirect FX trading.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Direct sales and trading : Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These principal market-making activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us. 

&#8226; 

Indirect FX trading : Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. 

State Street Corporation | 21 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue. 

Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our &#8220;Street FX&#8221; service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank. 

We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue." 

&#8226; 

Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions generate revenue through a &#8220;click&#8221; fee. 

&#8226; 

Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios. 

Securities Finance 

Our securities finance business consists of three components: 

(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds; 

(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and 

(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business. 

&#160;

Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split. 

As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower. 

Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results , decreased 28% and 26% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to decreases in enhanced custody balances due to client deleveraging and lower agency lending revenues due to a mix shift to fixed income assets and lower spreads . Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods. 

Software and Processing Fees 

Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance, fees from our structured products business and other revenue including equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of other assets, market-related adjustments and income associated with certain tax-advantaged investments. 

Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results , increased 40% and 7% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to higher CRD revenues and market-related adjustments. 

State Street Corporation | 22 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We acquired CRD on October 1, 2018. Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and software as service arrangements, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed on-premise is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms. The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon renewal of an on-premise software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a Software as a Service (SaaS) related arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to quarter. 

CRD contributed approximately $138 million and $233 million in total revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $87 million and $183 million in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. The increase in revenue in both the three and six months periods is driven by a significant CRD wealth client implementation and multiple client renewals. 

CRD revenue with affiliated entities, which is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements, was $7 million and $12 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $4 million and $7 million in the same periods in 2019, respectively. 

Expenses 

Total expenses for Investment Servicing decreased 3% and 1% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 , primarily due to resource discipline initiatives and vendor savings, partially offset by technology infrastructure and operational investments. 

CRD contributed approximately $61 million and $119 million in total expenses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $46 million and $87 million in the same periods in 2019 , respectively. In addition, CRD-related expenses include $16 million and $33 million in amortization of 

&#160;

other intangible assets in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to $17 million and $32 million in the same periods in 2019, respectively. 

Additional information about expenses is provided under "Expenses" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Management Fees 

Management fees decreased 4% in the second quarter of 2020 , compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to institutional net outflows, partially offset by net inflows from cash and ETFs, particularly in SPDR&#174; Portfolio and Sector ETFs. Management fees increased 2% in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to higher average equity market levels, cash and ETF net new business, partially offset by institutional outflows and mix changes away from higher fee institutional products.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 26% and 27% of total management fees in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to approximately 27% in both the same periods in 2019 .

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients. 

Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is influenced by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

(3) Consists entirely of U.S. securities. 

Additional information about our investment securities portfolio, including our allowance for credit losses on investment securities, is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . 

We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global interest rate environment. 

&#160;

We consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition. 

Average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 2.4 years and 2.7 years as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. The decrease in securities duration is primarily driven by a significant increase in the HTM investment portfolio from securities purchased under the MMLF program. Excluding HTM securities purchased under the MMLF program, the average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 2.8 years and 2.7 years as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

As presented in the table below, approximately 90% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated &#8220;AAA&#8221; or &#8220;AA&#8221; as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , excluding the securities purchased under the MMLF program. The Federal Reserve has taken on the credit risk of the assets purchased under the MMLF program, including municipal securities. The securities purchased under the MMLF program were primarily short-duration securities.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our aggregate municipal securities exposure presented in Table 25: State and Municipal Obligors , was concentrated primarily with highly-rated counterparties, with approximately 86% of the obligors rated &#8220;AAA&#8221; or &#8220;AA&#8221;, or equivalent, as of June 30, 2020 . Additionally, as of June 30, 2020 , approximately 27% , 71% and 2% of our aggregate municipal securities exposure was associated with general obligation bonds, revenue bonds and certification participations, respectively. The portfolios are also diversified geographically, with the states that represent our largest exposures widely dispersed across the U.S.

(1) Domestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower&#8217;s country of domicile. 

(2) Fund finance loans include primarily $5,026 million loans to real money funds, $7,272 million private equity capital call finance loans and $820 million loans to business development companies as of June 30, 2020 , compared to $6,040 million loans to real money funds, $6,076 million private equity capital call finance loans and $932 million loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2019 . 

(3) Includes $1,448 million securities finance loans, $933 million loans to municipalities and $97 million other loans as of June 30, 2020 and $2,537 million securities finance loans, $848 million loans to municipalities and $26 million other loans as of December 31, 2019 . 

The increase in loans in the commercial and financial segment as of June 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by higher levels of client overdrafts as we helped clients facilitate the higher settlement of trades and FX activities during the first six months of 2020. 

As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our leveraged loans, totaled approximately $4.30 billion and $4.46 billion , respectively. In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2020 and 

&#160;

December 31, 2019 of $87 million and $176 million , respectively, to participate in such syndications. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . 

These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated &#8220;speculative&#8221; under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q ), are externally rated &#8220;BBB,&#8221; &#8220;BB&#8221; or &#8220;B,&#8221; with approximately 83% and 86% of the loans rated &#8220;BB&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio. 

Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . 

No loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We recorded a provision for credit losses related to loans and financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities classified as HTM and off-balance sheet commitments of $52 million and $88 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 respectively, based on the CECL methodology, compared to $1 million and $5 million in the same periods in 2019 respectively (which were under the previous incurred loss model). Additional information is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. For additional information on the previous loss model, please refer to Note 4 of the 2019 Form 10-K. 

As of June 30, 2020 , approximately $113 million of our allowance for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial segment compared to $64 million as of June 30, 2019 , reflecting portfolio credit migration. As our view on current and future economic scenarios change, our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit losses, reflecting credit downgrades within our loan portfolio, as well as a downward revision in management's economic outlook as of quarter-end. The remaining $50 million and $8 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, was related to off-balance sheet commitments and other financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities held to maturity. 

An allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities upon acquisition of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair value and expected future cash flows of the investment securities are less than their amortized cost basis. Please refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for additional information. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, the credit-related component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would be recorded in the provision for credit losses. Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . 

Cross-Border Outstandings 

Cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-U.S. counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. Our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; 

&#160;

investment securities; amounts related to FX and interest rate contracts; and securities finance. &#160; In addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their obligations. 

As market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. As a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility. 

The cross-border outstandings presented in Table 28: Cross-border outstandings , represented approximately 25% and 28% of our consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Risk Management 

In the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following: 

&#8226; 

credit and counterparty risk; 

&#8226; 

liquidity risk, funding and management; 

&#8226; 

operational risk; 

&#8226; 

information technology risk; 

&#8226; 

market risk associated with our trading activities; 

&#8226; 

market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest rate risk; 

&#8226; 

model risk; 

&#8226; 

strategic risk; and 

&#8226; 

reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk. 

Many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail on pages 18 to 47 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

For additional information about our risk management, including our risk appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 80 to 84 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 

We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortized cost and 

&#160;

investment securities held-to-maturity. We also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. The two components together represent the allowance for credit losses. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and their effect on our counterparties in our expectation of credit losses. We utilize multiple economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenario, to develop management&#8217;s forecast of future expected losses. 

The economic forecast utilized in the second quarter of 2020 reflects a significant shift in economic outlook, with the expectation of an economic contraction over several quarters due to the impact of COVID-19. We took steps in late March 2020 to incorporate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic forecast utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses. Such outlook continues to evolve as new information becomes available and if the economic forecast worsens relative to the information utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2020, our allowance for credit losses will increase accordingly in future periods. The market and economic uncertainty has also increased the risks inherent in our activities as a credit provider to investment pools and other institutional investors. Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 

For additional information about our credit risk management framework, including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings, risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring and controls, refer to pages 84 to 89 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk Management 

Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets. 

State Street Corporation | 31 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. We also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at the Parent Company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. Reference our SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company. As of June 30, 2020 , the Parent Company and State Street Bank had approximately $3.21 billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months. 

As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity risk metrics, refer to pages 89 to 93 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, in our 2019 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity ratios, including LCR and the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 9 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Asset Liquidity 

Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of unencumbered highly liquid securities, cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statement of condition. We restrict the eligibility of securities to be characterized as asset liquidity to U.S. Government and federal agency securities (including MBS), securities of selected non-U.S. Governments and supranational organizations as well as certain other high-quality securities which generally are more liquid than other types of assets even in times of stress. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution&#8217;s HQLA against its net cash outflows. HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily. For the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , daily average LCR for the Parent Company was 109% and 110% , respectively. The average HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR final rule was $141.69 billion and $100.23 billion , post-prescribed haircuts, for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately $84.44 billion at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 , compared to $41.56 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 . The higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits. 

Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the FHLB and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB. 

Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window. 

State Street Corporation | 32 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. These securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity. 

The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $83.20 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared to $76.94 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 . 

Uses of Liquidity 

Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; or other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring significant use of our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program. 

We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $33.13 billion and $29.70 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $3.25 billion and $3.32 billion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of June 30, 2020 , approximately 73% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 6% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year . Since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being fully drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements. 

Resolution Planning 

State Street, like other bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, periodically submits a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will, to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of our insolvency, to maintain State Street Bank&#8217;s role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have and will continue to focus management attention and resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning. 

We submitted our updated 2019 165(d) resolution plan describing our preferred resolution strategy to the Federal Reserve and FDIC (the Agencies) before July 1, 2019, and our resolution strategy is materially consistent with our prior resolution strategy. In reviewing the 2019 plan, the Agencies noted 

&#160;

meaningful improvements over prior plan submissions. The Agencies did not identify any deficiencies in the 2019 plan, but did identify one shortcoming related to the implementation of governance mechanisms. We submitted to the Agencies our plan to remediate this shortcoming in line with the expected timeframe. In addition to the above letter, the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly issued a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019. This final rule revised the implementation requirements under the Dodd Frank Act's resolution planning provisions by means of establishing a biennial filing cycle for the U.S. G-SIBs, including State Street. This cycle alternates between a targeted resolution plan, followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agencies have published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan, to include the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information, including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The next resolution plan is due on July 1, 2021. 

In the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. For additional information about the SPOE Strategy, refer to pages 12 to 14 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2019 Form 10-K. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF, our Beneficiary Entities (as defined below) and certain other of our entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and our other entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity (collectively with State Street Bank, &#8220;Beneficiary Entities&#8221;), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the Parent Company&#8217;s claimants. 

Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits, debt investments, investments in marketable securities and other cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF contemporaneous with entering into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company&#8217;s capital and liquidity policies. Under the 

State Street Corporation | 33 

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

support agreement, the Parent Company is only permitted to retain certain amounts of cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow us to continue to meet our obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a "Recapitalization Event" (as defined below). The support agreement does not contemplate that SSIF is obligated to maintain any specific level of resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy. 

In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent Company&#8217;s other affiliates. 

In accordance with its policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and the other Beneficiary Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. In the event that we experience material financial distress, the support agreement requires us to model and calculate certain capital and liquidity triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not the Parent Company should commence preparations for a bankruptcy filing and whether or not a Recapitalization Event has occurred. 

Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement; (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities&#8217; continued operation; and (4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the support agreement, should rely, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities, on any of our affiliates being or remaining a Beneficiary 

&#160;

Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement. 

A &#8220;Recapitalization Event&#8221; is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. These thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support. The SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place. An expected effect of the SPOE Strategy and applicable TLAC regulatory requirements is that losses will be imposed on the Parent Company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of TLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the Parent Company's operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors, or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk. 

There can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our 2019 resolution plan or the support agreement, will not downgrade, place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generally or on specific debt securities. Any such downgrade, placement on negative watch or change in outlook could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in restrictive covenants in future debt agreements and could also adversely impact the trading prices, or the liquidity, of our outstanding debt securities. 

State Street Bank is also required to submit, periodically in accordance with applicable regulations and FDIC guidance, a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an Insured Depository Institution (IDI) plan. On April 22, 2019, the Federal Register published the FDIC&#8217;s advance notice of proposed rulemaking in which it invited comment on potential revisions to its IDI plan requirements. In addition to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking, on April 16, 2019, the FDIC Board voted to delay the next round of submissions under the IDI Rule until the rulemaking process has been completed. On May 20, 2020, the FDIC released a statement notifying of its plan to issue a proposal in the current year that may require the submission of a targeted IDI plan in 2021.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Funding 

Deposits 

We provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of June 30, 2020 , approximately 65% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, approximately 15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , approximately 60% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, approximately 20% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies. 

Short-Term Funding 

Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under &#8220;Asset Liquidity,&#8221; State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral. 

Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. These balances were $3.51 billion and $1.10 billion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $1.40 billion , or approximately $1.03 billion , as of June 30, 2020 , to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit. 

Long-Term Funding 

We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. In addition, State Street Bank also has current authorization from 

&#160;

the Board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt and an additional $500 million of subordinated debt. 

Agency Credit Ratings 

Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include: 

&#8226; 

diverse and stable core earnings; 

&#8226; 

relative market position; 

&#8226; 

strong risk management; 

&#8226; 

strong capital ratios; 

&#8226; 

diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits; 

&#8226; 

strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and 

&#8226; 

preparedness for current or future regulatory developments. 

High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by: 

&#8226; 

providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors; 

&#8226; 

increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products; 

&#8226; 

serving markets; and 

&#8226; 

engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings. 

A downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts. 

A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q . Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Operational Risk Management 

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human error and systems or from external events. 

I n light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted business continuity arrangements across our operating locations and we and a significant percentage of our key service providers are operating significantly or entirely in a work from home environment. Due to the related market disruption, we have also been processing a historically high volume of transactions on behalf of our clients. Both the operating environment and market dynamics increase operational risk and information technology risk, including cyber-threats. See also &#8220;Information Technology Risk Management&#8221; below. 

For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages 93 to 97 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Information Technology Risk Management 

We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies. 

For additional information about our information technology risk framework, refer to pages 97 to 98 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 

Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, FX rates or commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset and liability management activities. 

Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under &#8220;Trading Activities.&#8221; Information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under &#8220;Asset and Liability Management Activities.&#8221; 

Trading Activities 

In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, 

&#160;

our clients' requirements and market volatility, and our execution against those factors. 

For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading activities, refer to pages 98 to 99 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the FX and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including FX forward contracts, FX and interest-rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures. As of June 30, 2020 , the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.64 trillion , of which $2.62 trillion was composed of FX forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of tightly controlling related currency and interest rate risk. All FX contracts are valued daily at current market rates. 

Value-at-Risk and Stressed Value-at-Risk 

We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading related VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading related VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. 

We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model identifies the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard &#38; Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be automatically incorporated.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and methodologies, refer to pages 100 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Stress Testing 

We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk). 

Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Trading and Markets Risk Committee (TMRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the TMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan. 

Validation and Back-Testing 

We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual P&#38;L outcomes, observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using &#8220;clean&#8221; P&#38;L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading. 

Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity. 

We had no back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 . We had three back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , all of which occurred during the heightened market volatility witnessed in March 2020. We had one back-testing exception in the quarter ended June 30, 2019 . 

The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 . A covered position is generally defined by U.S. banking regulators as an on-or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. 

Diversification effect in the table below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the trading activities are not perfectly correlated. TABLE 29: TEN-DAY VALUE-AT-RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES FOR COVERED POSITIONS

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The three month average of our stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $31 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared to an average of approximately $40 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and $33 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 . The decrease in the average stressed VaR compared to the quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 , is primarily attributed to lower foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions. 

The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. Overall levels of volatility have been low, both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. 

We may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures. The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to FX risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 . Diversification effect in the table below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each risk category. This effect arises because the risk categories are not perfectly correlated. TABLE 31: TEN-DAY VALUE-AT-RISK ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK FACTOR FOR COVERED POSITIONS (1)

(1) For purposes of risk attribution by component, FX refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. &#160; Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these FX instruments is included in the interest rate risk component. 

Asset and Liability Management Activities 

The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities . 

We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Table 33 , Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019. Our June 30, 2020 baseline forecast assumes no changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In Table 34: Net Interest Income Sensitivity , we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance. While investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our modeling approach in the past has been to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rate scenarios. However, for the June 30, 2020 reporting period, and consistent with our approach for the first quarter of 2020, we reevaluated this approach for our +100 bps shock scenario in light of the current rate environment. Under this scenario, which assumes that the Federal Reserve increases its target range by 1.00% to 1.25% along with increases by other central banks, client deposits are modeled to return to average balance levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents held with central banks. For the -100 bps shock scenario at June 30, 2020, we continue to hold the balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook, including client deposits, given the amount of fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing already implied in the baseline scenario. Another factor was that the current -100 bps scenario is impacted by assumed floors as interest rates reach zero for certain currencies including U.S. dollar scenario.

As of June 30, 2020 , NII is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to June 30, 2019, our NII is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily driven by lower deposit beta assumptions given the current interest rate environment. Our positioning to parallel rate decreases has shifted to benefit NII driven by changes to the composition of our deposit base as well as impacts by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero, which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized. 

U.S. dollar NII as of June 30, 2020 remains positioned to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and to decline under a parallel decrease in interest rates. Compared to June 30, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII benefit to higher rates has increased due to lower deposit betas and lower prepayments in the investment portfolio. Compared to June 30, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by changes to the composition of U.S. deposits and cash flow hedging activity which impacts our short-end sensitivities. Our U.S. declining rate scenarios are also impacted by assumed floors as U.S. interest rates approach zero. 

NII is still positioned to benefit from changes in non-U.S. interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the short-end of the curve given deposit pricing expectations. Compared to June 30, 2019, our non-U.S. benefit to higher rates has decreased while the benefit to lower rates has increased. The decreased benefit to higher rates is driven by EMEA deposit pricing actions in addition to the treatment of excess reserves by the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank. The increased benefit to lower rates is impacted by the aforementioned deposit pricing and excess reserve changes. 

EVE sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. In the following table, we report our EVE sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. Management compares the change in EVE sensitivity against our aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements. EVE sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2020 , EVE sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. Compared to June 30, 2019 , the change in the up 200 bps instantaneous shock scenario was primarily driven by the benefit from increased liability duration from deposit modeling updates and long-term debt issuances. The down 200 bps instantaneous shock results are impacted by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero, which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized. 

Both NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Model Risk Management 

The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk. 

For additional information about our model risk management framework, including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 105 to 106 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Strategic Risk Management 

We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our 

&#160;

business plans and risk and capital management processes. Active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business. 

For additional information about our strategic risk management framework, refer to page 106 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Capital 

Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics. 

Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III rule. Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% leverage buffer under the Basel III rule. If we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments. 

Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements. 

For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 106 to 113 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Regulatory Capital 

We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. Provisions of the Basel III rule became effective with full implementation on January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators effective as of January 2013. 

The minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2020, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, are 8.0% for CET1 capital, 9.5% for tier 1 risk-based capital and 11.5% for total risk-based capital. Based on a calculation date of December 31, 2018, our G-SIB surcharge for 2020 was reduced to 1.0%. Based on a calculation date of December 31, 2019, our G-SIB surcharge for 2021 will be 1.0%. 

On June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from this year's DFAST stress test, including our preliminary SCB of 2.5%, implying no change to our regulatory capital requirements at this time. The Federal Reserve will provide each participating CCAR bank with its final SCB by August 31, 2020. Additionally, included in this notification and in light of the considerable economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all participating CCAR banks will be required to resubmit their capital plans within 45 days of the Federal Reserve providing updated scenarios. 

In line with the decision to administer a new stress test, the Federal Reserve is limiting the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to make capital 

&#160;

distributions in the third quarter of 2020, although banking organizations are permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levels. As a result, CCAR banking organizations, including us, will not be permitted to return capital to shareholders in the form of common share repurchases during the third quarter of 2020, unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve. As of now, our capital distributions in the fourth quarter of 2020 and beyond will be governed by our minimum capital requirements inclusive of the SCB. It is unclear at this time when the results of the new stress test will be made available, or whether the results will impact our calculated SCB and distributions beyond the third quarter of 2020. 

To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H, respectively. 

The Basel III rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the &#8220;standardized approach" and the &#8220;advanced approaches", applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to operational risk.

(3) Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Our CET1 capital increased $0.96 billion as of June 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 , primarily driven by higher net income. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we, along with all other U.S. G-SIBs, did not distribute capital in the form of share repurchases in the second quarter of 2020 . We also maintained our per share common dividend at $0.52 per share. We are suspending the repurchase of our common stock in the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, our continued capital optimization efforts resulted in lower preferred stock dividends in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. 

Our tier 1 capital increased $0.46 billion as of June 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 , due to the aforementioned increase in our CET1 capital, which was partially offset by the redemption of all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock as of March 15, 2020 at redemption price of $0.50 billion . Total capital increased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $0.38 billion and $0.41 billion , respectively, primarily due to the changes in our tier 1 and tier 2 capital. As described above, no share repurchases were executed in the second quarter of 2020 . 

The table below presents a roll-forward of CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2019 .

(1) Standardized approach RWA as of the periods noted above were calculated using our estimates, based on our then current interpretation of the Basel III rule. 

(2) Includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, non-material portfolio, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks, equity exposures and 6% credit risk supervisory charge. 

(3) Includes assets not in a definable category, cleared transactions, other wholesale, cash and due from, and interest-bearing deposits with banks and equity exposures. 

As of June 30, 2020 , total advanced approaches RWA decreased $0.60 billion compared to December 31, 2019 , mainly due to a decrease in operational risk RWA, partially offset by an increase in credit risk RWA. The decrease in operational risk RWA was driven by a decline in the frequency of conduct and compliance loss events. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily due to an increase in loans, all other, and repo-style transactions RWA, partially offset by a decrease in OTC derivatives RWA. 

As of June 30, 2020 , total standardized approach RWA increased $2.83 billion compared to December 31, 2019 , mainly due to an increase in credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily due to an increase in loans and all other RWA, partially offset by a decrease in repo-style transactions RWA. 

The regulatory capital ratios as of June 30, 2020 , presented in Table 36: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios , are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the Basel III rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of June 30, 2020 , based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as &#8220;advanced systems,&#8221; in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. 

Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined unit of measure (UOM), and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations. 

Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios 

The SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators&#8217; Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well capitalized tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%. 

Effective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted a final rule as part of the EGRRCPA that establishes a deduction for qualifying central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization&#8217;s total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we have excluded $84.5 billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the calculation of our SLR, based on this custodial banking deduction.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity 

In 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, that is intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards. Among other things, the TLAC final rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC and external LTD effective January 1, 2019. Specifically, we must hold (1) combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD in the amount equal to the greater of 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0%) and 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the SLR buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the SLR final rule; and (2) qualifying external LTD equal to the greater of 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under method 2 of 1.0%) and 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR final rule. As of April 1, 2020, the TLAC and LTD requirements calibrated to SLR reflect the deduction of certain central bank balances as prescribed by the regulatory relief implemented under the EGRRCPA. 

The following table presents our external LTD and external TLAC as of June 30, 2020.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Regulatory Developments 

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2.0% supplementary leverage ratio buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge, which is currently 1.0% for us. This proposal would also make conforming modifications to our TLAC and eligible LTD requirements applicable to G-SIBs. At this point in time, it is unclear whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed. 

In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the Standardized Approach for counterparty credit risk as a replacement of the Current Exposure Method for calculating exposure-at-default of derivatives exposures. Mandatory compliance with the final rule is required by January 1, 2022. 

On March 4, 2020, the Agencies issued the SCB final rule that will replace, under the Standardized Approach, the current capital conservation buffer (2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between the institution&#8217;s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. Effective October 1, 2020, State Street will be subject to the SCB requirement, which will replace the capital conservation buffer. Our calculated SCB under this year&#8217;s supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, preliminarily resulting in an SCB at that floor. 

Following the launch of the MMLF program, the Federal Reserve issued a rule on March 19, 2020, allowing Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) to exclude assets purchased with the MMLF program from their RWA, total leverage exposure and average total consolidated assets. 

On March 27, 2020, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) announced the deferral of the implementation of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023. As of now, the U.S. Agencies have not formally proposed the implementation of the BCBS revisions. 

On March 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that revised the definition of eligible retained income for all U.S. banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the federal banking agencies' capital or TLAC rules take effect on a more gradual basis in the event that a banking organization's capital, leverage, or TLAC ratios were to decline below regulatory requirements (including buffers). 

&#160;

In addition to the regulatory relief granted to custodial banks under the EGRRCPA, an SLR interim final rule released on April 1, 2020 allows all BHCs to deduct their deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and their investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverage exposure on a temporary basis, from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021. The temporary deduction of State Street's investment in U.S. Treasuries is incremental to the enduring central bank placement deduction granted to custodian banks under EGRRCPA. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, State Street was permitted to deduct $14.2 billion invested in U.S. Treasuries from its total leverage exposure. On May 15, 2020, the U.S. Agencies released an interim final rule that permits insured depository institutions of BHCs also to temporarily exclude deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverage exposure. State Street Bank has elected not to apply such exclusions as of June 30, 2020. 

On June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from this year's DFAST stress test, including our preliminary SCB of 2.5%, implying no change to our regulatory capital requirements at this time. The Federal Reserve will provide each participating CCAR bank with its final SCB by August 31, 2020. Additionally, included in this notification and in light of the considerable economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all participating CCAR banks will be required to resubmit their capital plans within 45 days of the Federal Reserve providing updated scenarios. 

In line with the decision to administer a new stress test, the Federal Reserve is limiting the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to make capital distributions in the third quarter of 2020, although banking organizations are permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levels. As a result, CCAR banking organizations, including us, will not be permitted to return capital to shareholders in the form of common share repurchases during the third quarter of 2020, unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve. As of now, our capital distributions in the fourth quarter of 2020 and beyond will be governed by our minimum capital requirements inclusive of the SCB. It is unclear at this time when the results of the new stress test will be made available, or whether the results will impact our calculated SCB and distributions beyond the third quarter of 2020. 

For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 106-113 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K .

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In July 2020, we declared dividends in our Series D, F and G preferred stock of approximately $1,475, $2,625 and $1,338, respectively, per share, or approximately $0.37, $26.25 and $0.33, respectively, per depositary share. These dividends total approximately $11 million, $20 million and $7 million on our Series D, F and G preferred stock respectively, which will be paid in September 2020. 

Common Stock 

In June 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the CCAR 2019 submission; and in connection with that capital plan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases through the second quarter of 2020 to bolster capital in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second quarter of 2020 under our common stock purchase program announced in June 2019.

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 52 and 53 included under Item 5, Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in our 2019 Form 10-K, and to Note 15 on pages 159 to 161 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in our 2019 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times. 

Stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and our capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.

MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $367.21 billion and $367.90 billion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $384.76 billion and $385.43 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $384.76 billion and $385.43 billion , referenced above, $53.27 billion and $45.66 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. We or our agents held $56.83 billion and $48.89 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7 , 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q .

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. 

Certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements. 

Based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies and allowance for credit losses. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In January 2020, we adopted ASC 326, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortized cost and investment securities held to-maturity. We also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. The two components together represent the allowance for credit losses. 

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. We estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management&#8217;s expectation of expected credit losses

given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable. 

Additional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 

For additional information about these significant accounting policies refer to pages 115 to 117, &#8220;Significant Accounting Estimates&#8221; included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K.
