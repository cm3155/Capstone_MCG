State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is
a financial holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located
at  One  Lincoln  Street,  Boston,  Massachusetts  02111  (telephone
(617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-
Q  for  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2020  (Form  10-Q),  unless
the  context  requires  otherwise,  references  to  "State  Street,"  "we,"
"us,"  "our"  or  similar  terms  mean  State  Street  Corporation  and  its
subsidiaries  on  a  consolidated  basis.  The  Parent  Company  is  a
source  of  financial  and  managerial  strength  to  our  subsidiaries.
Through our subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary,
State  Street  Bank  and  Trust  Company,  referred  to  as  State  Street
Bank, we provide a broad range of financial products and services to
institutional  investors  worldwide,  with  $36.64  trillion  of  AUC/A  and
$3.15 trillion of AUM as of September 30, 2020.
As of September 30, 2020, we had consolidated total assets of
$272.08  billion,  consolidated  total  deposits  of  $197.51  billion,
consolidated total shareholders' equity of $25.56 billion and 38,979
employees.  We  operate  in  more  than  100  geographic  markets
worldwide,  including  in the  U.S.,  Canada,  Europe,  the  Middle  East
and Asia.
Our  operations  are  organized  into  two  lines  of  business,
Investment  Servicing  and  Investment  Management,  which  are
defined based on products and services provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in
Line of Business  Information  in this  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of the Form10-Q and updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our
2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2019  previously  filed  with  the  SEC  (2019  Form  10-K).  You  should
read  the  financial  information  contained  in  this  Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  and  elsewhere  in  this  Form  10-Q  in
conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our
2019 Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in
this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period
presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity
with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain
accounting  policies  that  materially  affect  the  reported  amounts  ofassets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.The  significant  accounting  policies  that  require  us  to  makejudgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  are  difficult,  subjectiveor  complex  about  matters  that  are  uncertain  and  may  change  insubsequent periods include: • accounting for fair value measurements;• impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;• contingencies; and• allowance for credit losses.
These  significant  accounting  policies  require  the  mostsubjective  or  complex  judgments,  and  underlying  estimates  andassumptions  could  be  subject  to  revision  as  new  informationbecomes available. For additional information about these significantaccounting  policies  refer  to  pages  115  to  117,  “SignificantAccounting  Estimates”  included  under  Item  7,  Management'sDiscussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  ofOperations,  in  our  2019  Form  10-K  and  Significant  AccountingEstimates  in  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition  and  Results  of  Operations  in  this  Form  10-Q.  Uponevaluating our accounting policies in light of our adoption of CECLon January 1, 2020, we included allowance for credit losses as oneof  our  significant  accounting  policies.  Other  than  including  thatadditional  significant  policy,  we  did  not  change  these  significantaccounting policies in the first nine months of 2020.Certain  financial  information  provided  in  this  Form  10-Q,including in this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is preparedon both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis. Wemeasure and compare certain financial information on a non-GAAPbasis, including information that management uses in evaluating ourbusiness and activities.
Non-GAAP  financial  information  should  be  considered  inaddition  to,  and  not  as  a  substitute  for  or  superior  to,  financialinformation prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAPfinancial  information  presented  in  this  Form  10-Q,  including  thisManagement’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,  is  reconciled  to  its  mostdirectly comparable U.S. GAAP-basis measure.We  further  believe  that  our  presentation  of  FTE  NII,  a  nonGAAP measure, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interestincome associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a FTEbasis,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe  following  “Financial  Results  and  Highlights”  section
provides  information  related  to  significant  events,  as  well  as
highlights of our consolidated financial results for the third quarter of
2020  presented  in  Table  1:  Overview  of  Financial  Results.  More
detailed  information  about  our  consolidated  financial  results,
including comparisons of our financial results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020 to the same periods in 2019, is
provided  under  “Consolidated  Results  of  Operations”,  "Line  of
Business Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as
well as in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. In
this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the
effects  of  changes  in  FX  rates,  those  effects  are  determined  by
applying  applicable  weighted  average  FX  rates  from  the  relevant
2019 period to the relevant 2020 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Third quarter of 2020 financial performance: ◦ EPS of $1.45 in the third quarter of 2020 increased
2% compared to $1.42 in the same period in 2019. ◦ In the third quarter of 2020, return on equity of 8.9%decreased  from  9.7%  in  the  same  period  in  2019,
primarily  due  to  higher  retained  earnings,  the
absence  of  share  repurchases  in  the  second  and
third quarters of 2020 and a decrease in net income
available  to  common  shareholders.  Pre-tax  margin
of  24.5%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020  decreased
from  24.8%  in  the  same  period  in  2019,  primarily
due to lower total revenue, partially offset by lower
expenses. ◦ Operating  leverage  was  an  unfavorable  (0.6)%  in
the  third  quarter  of  2020.  Operating  leverage
represents  the  difference  between  the  percentage
change in total revenue and the percentage change
in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior
year period. ◦ In August 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed that
our  SCB  will  be  2.5%  for  the  period  starting  on
October  1,  2020  and  ending  on  September  30,
2021,  resulting  in  no  change  to  our  capital
requirements.  Due  to  the  economic  challenges
created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we and other
participating CCAR banks are required to resubmit
our  capital  plans  by  November  2,  2020  under
updated scenarios provided by the Federal
Reserve.  Results  from  the  new  stress  test  areexpected  by  the  end  of  the  year,  however,  it  isunclear  whether  or  not  the  results  will  impact  ourcalculated  SCB.  In  line  with  the  decision  toadminister  a  new  stress  test,  the  Federal  Reservehas  continued  its  suspension  of  the  ability  of  allCCAR  banking  organizations  to  distribute  capitalbeyond  common  dividends  (at  their  current  levels)through the fourth quarter of 2020.• The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actions wetook  to  support  our  clients,  the  financial  markets  and  thebroader  economy,  is  reflected  in  our  results  for  the  thirdquarter and first nine months of 2020.◦ We  experienced  higher  levels  of  client  deposits,which  have  moderated  but  remain  above  preCOVID levels. ◦ We developed a safe and measured  framework  toreopen offices and are establishing a "Workplace ofthe  Future"  plan,  leveraging  technology  andoptimizing  a  hybrid  work  from  home  model,  withapproximately 80% of our employees continuing towork remotely at the end of the period.◦ We continued to onboard new clients and managedelevated transaction volumes during the COVID-19pandemic. ◦ We  continue  to  support  our  clients'  liquidity  needsthrough  our  participation  in  the  Money  MarketMutual  Fund  Liquidity  Facility  (MMLF)  and  arecustodian  and  administrator  for  four  FederalReserve  programs:  Commercial  Paper  FundingFacility, Main Street Lending Program, and Primaryand Secondary Markets Corporate Credit Facilities.◦ As  previously  announced,  together  with  the  otherU.S. based G-SIBs, we temporarily suspended ourcommon  stock  repurchase  program,  in  light  of  theCOVID-19  pandemic,  and  subsequently,  theFederal  Reserve  placed  limitations  on  capitaldistributions in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.As a result, we had no repurchases of our commonstock in the second and third quarters of 2020.State Street Corporation | 10
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS◦ Net  interest  income  declined,  reflecting  a  low
interest  rate  environment  resulting  from  Federal
Reserve actions to support the economy.
Revenue
• Total fee revenue increased 2% in the third quarter of 2020
compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019,  primarily  driven  by
increases  in  servicing  fees,  management  fees,  foreign
exchange  trading  services  and  software  and  processing
fees,  partially  offset  by  lower  securities  finance  revenues.
Total  revenue  decreased  4%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020
compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019,  due  to  a  decline  in
NII, partially offset by an increase in total fee revenue. • Servicing  fee  revenue  increased  2% in the  third  quarter  of
2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to
higher average  market  levels,  net new business  and client
activity, partially offset by moderating pricing headwinds. • Management fee revenue increased 2% in the third quarter
of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due
to  higher  average  market  levels,  partially  offset  by
institutional net outflows. • Foreign exchange trading services increased 4% in the third
quarter  of  2020  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019,
primarily reflecting higher client FX volumes and volatility. • Securities  finance  revenue  decreased  28%  in  the  third
quarter  of  2020  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019,
primarily driven by decreases in enhanced custody balances
due  to  client  deleveraging  and  lower  agency  lending
revenues due to lower spreads and reinvestment yields. • Software and processing fees revenue increased 21% in the
third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019,
primarily  due  to  higher  CRD  revenues  driven  by  SaaS
revenue and professional services fees, and market-related
adjustments. • CRD contributed approximately $89 million and $62 million
in total revenue and total expenses, respectively, in the third
quarter  of  2020,  compared  to  $81  million  and  $56  million,
respectively, in the same period in 2019. In addition to total
revenue and expenses, CRD-related expenses include $17
million in amortization of other intangible assets in both the
third quarters of 2020 and 2019. CRD revenue with affiliated
entities, which is eliminated in our consolidated
financial statements, was $10 million and $4 million for thethird quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively.• NII decreased 26% in the third quarter of 2020, compared tothe same period in 2019, primarily due to significantly lowermarket rates, higher MBS premium amortization, including atrue-up  of  approximately  $20  million  in  the  third  quarter  of2020,  and  the  absence  of  approximately  $20  millionepisodic market-related  benefits  in 2019, partially  offset  byhigher investment portfolio and loan balances.Provision for Credit Losses• In  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  we  recorded  no  provision  forcredit  losses  related  to  loans  and  financial  assets  held  atamortized  cost  and  off-balance  sheet  commitments  basedon  the  CECL  methodology,  adopted  January  1,  2020,primarily  due  to  slightly  improving  economic  forecasts  andlimited negative credit migration. • This compares to a $2 million provision for credit losses inthe  same  period  in  2019  (which  was  under  the  previousincurred loss model).
Expenses
• Total  expenses  decreased  4%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020compared  to  the  same  period  in  2019,  including  2%  lowercompensation  and  employee  benefits  costs,  primarilyreflecting on-going expense management initiatives.• The  impact  of  notable  items  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020includes  approximately  $15  million  of  acquisition  andrestructuring  costs  primarily  related to CRD, partially  offsetby a $9 million accrual release, compared to approximately$27  million  of  acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  and  an$18 million accrual in the same period in 2019.AUC/A and AUM• AUC/A increased 11% as of September 30, 2020 comparedto September  30, 2019, primarily  due to higher period-endmarket levels, net new business growth and client flows. Inthe third quarter of 2020, newly announced asset servicingmandates  totaled  approximately  $249  billion,  withapproximately one-third related to State Street AlphaSM, ourfront-to-back servicing platform. Servicing assets remainingto be installed in future periods totaled approximately $486billion as of September 30, 2020.
State Street Corporation | 11
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS• AUM increased 7% as of September 30, 2020 compared to
September  30,  2019,  primarily  due  to  higher  period-end
market levels and net inflows from ETFs, partially offset by
institutional net outflows.
Capital • In  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  we  returned  a  total  of
approximately $183 million to our shareholders in the formof common stock dividends. • We  declared  aggregate  common  stock  dividends  of  $0.52
per share, totaling $184 million in the third quarter of 2020,
compared  to  $0.52  per  share,  totaling  $189  million  in  the
same period in 2019. • We  had  no  repurchases  of  our  common  stock  in  the  third
quarter  of  2020  under  current  Federal  Reserve
requirements. In the third quarter of 2019, we acquired 9.4
million  shares  of  common  stock  at  an  average  per  share
cost of $53.15 and an aggregate cost of approximately $500
million. • Our binding CET1 capital ratio was 12.4% as of September
30,  2020  compared  to  11.7%  as  of  December  31,  2019,
driven  by  higher  retained  earnings,  partially  offset  by  an
increase  in  RWA,  with  significant  headroom  above  the
applicable regulatory requirement. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio
decreased to 6.6% as of September 30, 2020, compared to
6.9% as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase
in adjusted average assets in the third quarter of 2020. Our
standardized  approach  capital  ratios  were  binding  as  of
September 30, 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Servicingand management fees collectively made up approximately 76% and 73% of total fee revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30,2020, respectively, compared to 76% and 75% in the same periods in 2019, respectively.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, netnew  business  and  the  manner  in  which  we  price  our  services.  We  provide  a  range  of  services  to  our  clients,  including  core  custody  services,accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. Thebasis for fees will differ across regions and clients. On average and over time, approximately 55% of our servicing fee revenues have been variabledue to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another 15% of our servicing fees are impacted by thevolume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by marketfluctuations or values.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in marketvaluations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending onasset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients’ portfolios.
Over  the  five  years  ended  December  31,  2019,  we  estimate  that  worldwide  market  valuations  impacted  our  servicing  fee  revenues  byapproximately (2)% to 5% annually. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. Whilethe specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and dodiffer, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented.In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
We estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2020 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that:• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicingfees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over time, of approximately3%; and
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which ourservicing  fees  are calculated,  would result  in a corresponding  change  in our  total  servicing  fee  revenues,  on average  and over  time,  ofapproximately 1%.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSClient Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equityand derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Ourservicing  fee  revenues  are  impacted  by  a  number  of  factors,  including  transaction  volumes,  asset  levels  and  asset  classes  in  which  funds  areinvested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or otherconsiderations. Over the five years ended December 31, 2019, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing feerevenues  by  approximately  (1)%  to  2%  annually.  See  Table  5:  Industry  Asset  Flows  for  selected  asset  flow  information.  While  the  asset  flowspresented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flowsmay differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.TABLE 5: INDUSTRY ASSET FLOWS

Datacollection  and  tabulation  methodologies  among data providers  differ.  All  periods  presented  reflect  data sourced  from  Morningstar.  Prior  period data therefore  differs  from  data  previously  presented,  which  wassourced from other data providers.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressuretoday.  Consequently,  no  assumption  should  be  drawn  as  to  future  revenue  run  rate  from  announced  servicing  wins,  as  the  amount  of  revenueassociated  with  AUC/A  can  vary  materially.  On  average,  over  the  five  years  ended  December  31,  2019,  we  estimate  that  pricing  pressure  withrespect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any givenyear. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the terms ofour relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through thestandardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services, and theamount of revenue generated, may differ from the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboardthose new services, the nature of those services and client investment practices. This same market pressure also impacts the fees we negotiatewhen we win business from new clients.
Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2019, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing feerevenues by approximately 2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually.
New  business  impacting  servicing  fees  can  include:  custody;  product  and  participant  level  accounting;  daily  valuation  and  administration;record-keeping;  cash  management;  and  other  services.  Revenues  associated  with  new  servicing  mandates  may  vary  based  on  the  breadth  ofservices provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.
State Street Corporation | 14
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement Fee Revenue
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM,
which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees
for  certain  components  of  managed  assets,  such  as  ETFs,  mutual
funds and UCITS, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM.
Management  fee  revenue  is  more  sensitive  to  market  valuations
than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying
services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are
dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional
factors,  such  as  the  relative  mix  of  assets  managed,  may  have  a
significant  effect  on  our  management  fee  revenue.  While  certain
management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and
the  investment  strategies  employed,  management  fees  may  reflect
other  factors,  including  performance  fee  arrangements,  as  well  as
our  relationship  pricing  for  clients.  In  addition,  in  a  prolonged  lowinterest-rate environment, such as we are currently experiencing, we
have waived and may in the future waive certain fees for our clients
for money market products.
Asset-based  management  fees  for  passively  managed
products,  to  which  our  AUM  is  currently  primarily  weighted,  are
generally charged at a lower fee of AUM than for actively managed
products. Actively managed products may also include performance
fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based
on  predetermined  benchmarks  associated  with  the  applicable
account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as
of  September  30,  2020 and  assuming  that  all  other  factors  remain
constant,  including  the  impact  of  business  won  and  lost  and  client
flows, that: • A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations,
on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for
which our management fees are calculated, would result in
a  corresponding  change  in  our  total  management  fee
revenues, on average and over time, of approximately 5%;
and
• A  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  worldwide  fixed-income
valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant
periods  for  which  our  management  fees  are  calculated,
would  result  in  a  corresponding  change  in  our  total
management  fee  revenues,  on  average  and  over  time,  of
approximately 4%.
Daily  averages,  month-end  averages  and  quarter-end  indicesdemonstrate  worldwide  changes  in  equity  and  debt  markets  thataffect our management fee revenue. Quarter-end indices affect thevalues  of  AUM  as  of  those  dates.  See  Table  3:  Daily  Averages,Month-End  Averages  and  Quarter-End  Equity  Indices  for  selectedindices.
Additional  information  about  fee  revenue  is  provided  under"Line  of  Business  Information"  included  in  this  Management'sDiscussion and Analysis.
Net Interest IncomeSee  Table  2:  Total  Revenue,  for  the  breakout  of  interestincome and interest expense for the three and nine months endedSeptember 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019.NII  is  defined  as  interest  income  earned  on  interest-earningassets  less  interest  expense  incurred  on  interest-bearing  liabilities.Interest-earning  assets,  which  principally  consist  of  investmentsecurities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, resale agreements,loans  and  other  liquid  assets,  are  financed  primarily  by  clientdeposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.NIM  represents  the  relationship  between  annualized  FTE  NIIand  average  total  interest-earning  assets  for  the  period.  It  iscalculated  by  dividing  FTE  NII  by  average  interest-earning  assets.Revenue  that  is  exempt  from  income  taxes,  mainly  earned  fromcertain  investment  securities  (state  and  political  subdivisions),  isadjusted  to  a  FTE  basis  using  the  U.S.  federal  and  state  statutoryincome tax rates.
NII  on  a  FTE  basis  decreased  in  both  the  three  and  ninemonths ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periodsin  2019,  primarily  due  to  lower  market  rates,  the  absence  ofapproximately  $20  million  episodic  market-related  benefits  whichimpacted  the  third  quarter  of  2019  and  a  non-recurring  true-up  of$20  million  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020  of  prior  period  premiumamortization, partially offset by higher investment portfolio and loanbalances.
Investment  securities  net  premium  amortization,  which  isincluded in interest income, was $179 million and $396 million in thethree  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,compared  to  $116  million  and  $318  million  in  the  same  periods  in2019,  respectively,  primarily  related  to  higher  MBS  premiumamortization.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSInterest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on abasis approximating a level rate of return, over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable feesor costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. The amortization of premiums and accretionof discounts are adjusted for prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities amortizable purchase premium net of discount accretion for the periods indicated:TABLE 6: INVESTMENT SECURITIES NET PREMIUM AMORTIZATION

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility
In March 2020, in response to the economic impact of COVID-19, the Federal Reserve established the MMLF program in order to enhance theliquidity and functioning of crucial money markets. Through the establishment of the MMLF program, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston makesloans available to eligible financial institutions secured by high-quality assets purchased by the financial institution from money market mutual funds.The MMLF program is authorized through December 31, 2020. We are supporting our clients' liquidity needs through this program, following itsadoption on March 18, 2020. As a result of the asset purchases (including negotiable CDs, municipals and asset-backed commercial paper), ourparticipation in the facility was $7.5 billion on average in the third quarter of 2020, and earned $2 million of NII. We did not make any purchases ofHTM securities under the MMLF program in the third quarter of 2020. The purchases are match funded through Federal Reserve borrowings andthe assets are posted as collateral. The borrowing is non-recourse, meaning that the Federal Reserve has taken on the credit risk of the assetspurchased. The purchased securities are classified as held-to-maturity and have a maturity of less than 12 months. MMLF related assets do notimpact our risk-based and leverage capital ratios.

Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.09% and 0.14% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to0.33% and 0.45% in the same periods in 2019, respectively.

Average rates for total interest-bearing deposits excluding the impact of FX swap costs were (0.11)% and (0.01)% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to approximately 0.42%and 0.44% in the same periods in 2019, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSChanges  in  the  components  of  interest-earning  assets  and
interest-bearing  liabilities  are  discussed  in  more  detail  below.
Additional information about the components of interest income and
interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $225.81 billion and
$225.74 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2020, respectively, compared to $181.32 billion and $180.09 billion
in the same periods in 2019, respectively. The increase is primarily
driven by higher average total client deposits.
Interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  averaged  $72.72  billion
and  $75.52  billion  in the  three  and nine  months  ended  September
30, 2020, respectively, compared to $45.79 billion and $47.56 billion
in the same periods in 2019, respectively. These deposits primarily
reflect  our  maintenance  of  cash  balances  at  the  Federal  Reserve,
the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks.
The  higher  levels  of  average  cash  balances  with  central  banks
reflect higher levels of client deposits.
Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $4.18
billion  and  $3.11  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended
September  30,  2020,  respectively,  compared  to  $3.15  billion  and
$2.63 billion in the same periods in 2019, respectively. The impact of
balance  sheet  netting  was  $83.48  billion  and  $103.46  billion  on
average in the three and nine months  ended September  30, 2020, respectively,  compared  to  $117.94  billion  and  $84.20  billion  in  the
same periods in 2019, respectively. We maintain an agreement with
Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation  (FICC),  a  clearing  organization
that  enables  us  to  net  all  securities  sold  under  repurchase
agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with
counterparties  that  are  also  members  of  the  clearing  organization.
The increase in average balance sheet netting, in the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, is
primarily due to the expansion of our FICC program and new client
activity.
We have been a netting and sponsoring member within FICC
since 2005. FICC expanded the service in 2017, and since then, we
have  increased  our  participation.  We  enter  into  repurchase  and
resale  transactions  in eligible securities  with sponsored  clients  and
with  other  FICC  members  and,  pursuant  to  FICC  Government
Securities  Division  rules,  submit,  novate  and  net  the  transactions.
We  may  sponsor  clients  to  clear  their  eligible  repurchase
transactions  with  FICC,  backed  by  our  guarantee  to  FICC  of  the
prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations. We obtain a security interest from our
sponsored clients in the high quality
securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigateour potential exposure to FICC.
Average  investment  securities,  excluding  MMLF  HTMsecurities, increased to $102.96 billion and $98.70 billion in the threeand  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,  from$93.59  billion  and  $90.62  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2019,respectively,  primarily  driven  by  higher  MBS  balances  and  foreigngovernment bonds. The growth was driven by our redeployment ofhigher  structural  deposit  levels  that  resulted  from  the  COVID-19pandemic.
Loans  averaged  $25.97  billion  and  $27.27  billion  in  the  threeand  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,compared to $23.93 billion and $23.61 billion in the same periods in2019,  respectively.  Average  core  loans,  which  exclude  overdraftsand  highlight  our  efforts  to  grow  our  lending  portfolio,  averaged$22.54 billion and $22.42 billion in the three and nine months endedSeptember 30, 2020, compared to $19.78 billion and $19.62 billionin the same periods in 2019.
Average  other  interest-earning  assets,  largely  associated  withour  enhanced  custody  business,  decreased  to  $11.59  billion  and$10.73  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,2020  from  $13.99  billion  and  $14.79  billion  in  the  same  periods  in2019,  respectively,  primarily  driven  by  a  reduction  in  the  level  ofcash  collateral  posted  related  to  client  deleveraging.  Enhancedcustody  is  our  securities  financing  business  where  we  act  asprincipal with respect to our custody clients and generate securitiesfinance revenue. The NII earned on these transactions is generallylower than the interest earned on other alternative investments.Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to$154.95  billion  and  $152.55  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  monthsended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,  from  $128.53  billion  and$126.89  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2019,  respectively.  AverageU.S.  interest-bearing  deposits  increased  as  a  result  of  the  marketuncertainty  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  level  of  globalinterest  rates  and  new  deposit  gathering  initiatives.  We  expectdeposits  to  remain  elevated  within  the  current  environment  of  lowinterest rates and continued expansion of the money supply by theFederal  Reserve.  Future  deposit  levels  will  be  influenced  by  theunderlying  asset  servicing  business,  client  depositbehavior  andmarket conditions, including the levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interestrates.
Average other short-term borrowings, typically associated withour  tax-exempt  investment  program,  were  $1.72  billion  and  $2.58billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020,State Street Corporation | 18
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSrespectively, compared to $1.79 billion and $1.66 billion in the same
periods in 2019, respectively.
Average long-term debt was $14.79 billion and $14.55 billion in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively,
compared to $11.42 billion and $11.20 billion in the same periods in
2019,  respectively.  These  amounts  reflect  issuances,  redemptions
and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $2.76 billion and
$3.22  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,
2020, respectively, compared to $3.69 billion and $4.10 billion in the
same periods in 2019, respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities
primarily reflect  our level of cash collateral  received from  clients in
connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented
on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements.
Several  factors  could  affect  future  levels  of  NII  and  NIM,
including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources;
central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes
in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or
proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations
of  those  standards;  the  yields  earned  on  securities  purchased
compared  to  the  yields  earned  on  securities  sold  or  matured  and
changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
Based  on  market  conditions  and  other  factors,  including
regulatory  standards,  we  continue  to  reinvest  the  majority  of  the
proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in
highly-rated  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities,  such  as  federal  agency
MBS,  sovereign  debt  securities  and  U.S.  Treasury  and  agency
securities.  The  pace  at  which  we  reinvest  and  the  types  of
investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market
conditions,  the  implementation  of  regulatory  standards,  including
interpretation  of  those  standards  and  other  factors  over  time.  We
expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact
our reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
In  January  2020,  we  adopted  ASU  2016-13,  Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments, which  replaces  the  incurred  loss
methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to
as  CECL methodology.  The  impact  of  transitioning  to  ASC 326  on
the  consolidated  financial  statements  was  an  increase  in  the
allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $3
million  as  of  January  1,  2020.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  we
recorded no provision for credit losses
related to loans and financial assets held at amortized cost and offbalance  sheet  commitments  based  on  the  CECL  methodology,reflecting slightly improving economic forecasts and limited negativecredit migration.
This compares to a $2 million provision for credit losses in thesame  period  in  2019  (which  was  under  the  previous  incurred  lossmodel).  Additional  information  is  provided  under  “Loans”  in"Financial Condition" in this Management's Discussion and Analysisand in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form10-Q.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCompensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 2%in  both  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,
compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2019,  primarily  due  to  lower
headcount,  lower  contractor  spend,  employee  medical  costs  and
incentive compensation.
Total  headcount  decreased  by  approximately  1%  as  of
September  30,  2020  compared  to  September  30,  2019,  primarily
driven by productivity savings.
Information systems and communications expenses increased
5% in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020,
compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase was primarily
related  to  software  costs  and  technology  infrastructure
enhancements, partially offset by third-party vendor savings.
Transaction processing services expenses decreased 8% and
3%  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,
respectively,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2019,  primarily
reflecting higher sub-custody savings.
Occupancy expenses decreased 4% and 5% in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to
the same periods in 2019, primarily due to the advancement of our
global optimization footprint strategy.
Amortization of other intangible assets were flat and decreased
2%  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,
respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019.
Other expenses decreased 15% and 14% in the three and nine
months  ended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,  compared  to  the
same periods in 2019, primarily driven by an $18 million accrual in
the  third  quarter  of  2019,  a  $9  million  accrual  release  in  the  third
quarter of 2020, and lower marketing and travel costs, partially offset
by higher professional fees.
In  April  2020,  we  announced  that  we  were  deferring  most
planned  headcount  reductions  through  the  end  of  2020,  in  light  of
the  COVID-19  pandemic.  We  expect  our  planned  actions  will  take
place following that period.
Acquisition Costs
We  recorded  approximately  $15  million  and  $38  million  of
acquisition costs in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2020,  respectively,  compared  to  $27  million  and  $50  million  in  the
same  periods  in  2019,  respectively,  related  to  our  acquisition  of
CRD. As we integrate CRD into our business, we expect to incur a
total  of  approximately  $200  million  of  acquisition  costs,  including
merger  and  integration  costs,  through  2021,  of  which  $148  million
has been incurred as of September 30, 2020, since the acquisition.

Our effective tax rate was 18.5% and 16.6% inthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively,compared  to  19.2%  and  19.1%  in  the  same  periods  in  2019,respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the three andnine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,  compared  to  the  sameperiods  in  2019,  includes  a  reduction  in  a  valuation  allowancerelated to foreign tax credits.

Servicing FeesServicing fees, as presented in Table 10: Investment ServicingLine of Business Results, increased 2% in both the three and ninemonths ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periodsin  2019,  primarily  due  to  higher  average  market  levels,  net  newbusiness  and  client  activity,  partially  offset  by  moderating  pricingheadwinds. FX rates positively impacted servicing fees by 1% in thethird quarter of 2020 and negatively impacted servicing fees by 2%in the same period in 2019.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately47% and 46% of total  servicing  fees  in the three  and nine monthsended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,  compared  toapproximately 47% in both the same periods in 2019.State Street Corporation | 21

(1) Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not
necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the third quarter
of  2020  totaled  approximately  $249  billion.  Servicing  assets
remaining  to  be  installed  in  future  periods  totaled  approximately
$486  billion  as  of  September  30,  2020,  which  will  be  reflected  in
AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing
fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such
mandates  will  be  realized  over  several  quarters  as  the  assets  are
installed and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of
definitive  agreements,  approval  of  applicable  boards  and
shareholders  and  customary  regulatory  approvals.  New  asset
servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in
future  periods  exclude  certain  new  business  which  has  been
contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission
to  publicly  disclose  and  the  expected  installation  date  extends
beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time
may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates
and  reflected  in  servicing  assets  remaining  to  be  installed  in  the
period  in  which  the  client  provides  its  permission.  Servicing
mandates  and  servicing  assets  remaining  to  be  installed  in  future
periods  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  and  therefore  also  do  not
include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period
of their intent to
terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from timeto time be significant.
With  respect  to these  new servicing  mandates,  once installedwe  may  provide  various  services,  including  accounting,  bank  loanservicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depositorybanking  services,  FX,  fund  administration,  hedge  fund  servicing,middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equityadministration, real estate administration, securities finance, transferagency  and  wealth  management  services.  Revenues  associatedwith  new  servicing  mandates  may  vary  based  on  the  breadth  ofservices  provided  and  the  timing  of  installation,  and  the  types  ofassets.
For additional information about the impact of worldwide equityand fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other keydrivers  of  our  servicing  fee  revenue,  refer  to  "Fee  Revenue"  in"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management'sDiscussion and Analysis.
Foreign Exchange Trading ServicesForeign  exchange  trading  services  revenue,  as  presented  inTable 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased1%  and  36%  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,2020, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarilydue  to  higher  client  FX  volumes  and  volatility.  Foreign  exchangetrading  services  is  composed  of  revenue  generated  by  FX  tradingand  revenue  generated  by  brokerage  and  other  trading  services,which  made  up  56%  and  44%,  respectively,  of  foreign  exchangetrading services revenue in the third quarter of 2020 and 65% and35%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue inthe nine months ended September 30, 2020.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principalmarket-maker  through  both  "direct  sales  and  trading”  and  “indirectFX trading.” • Direct sales and trading:  Represent  FX  transactions  atnegotiated rates with clients and investment managers thatcontact  our  trading  desk  directly.  These  principal  marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced bythird  party  custodians  or  prime  brokers,  as  well  as  thosefunds under custody with us. • Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients,for  which  we  are  the  funds'  custodian,  or  their  investmentmanagers,  routed  to  our  FX  desk  through  our  assetservicing  operation.  We  execute  indirect  FX  trades  as  aprincipal at rates disclosed to our clients.Our  FX  trading  revenue  is  influenced  by  multiple  factors,including: the volume and type of client FXState Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONStransactions  and  related  spreads;  currency  volatility,  reflecting
market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest
rate  and  other  market  risks  associated  with  our  FX  activities.  The
relative  impact  of  these  factors  on  our  total  FX  trading  revenues
often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other
factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bidoffer  spreads  across  product  mix  tend  to  result  in  increases  or
decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our  clients  that  utilize  indirect  FX  trading  can,  in  addition  to
executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us,
transition from indirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading
execution,  including  our  “Street  FX”  service,  or  to  one  of  our
electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act
as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX
execution  strategy  and  automate  the  FX  trade  execution  process,
both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody
at another bank.
We  also  earn  foreign  exchange  trading  services  revenue
through  "electronic  FX  services"  and  "other  trading,  transition
management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute
FX  transactions  through  one  of  our  electronic  trading
platforms.  These  transactions  generate  revenue  through  a
“click” fee. • Other  trading,  transition  management  and  brokerage
revenue: As our clients look to us to enhance and preserve
portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or
Currency  Management  capabilities  or  transact  with  our
Equity  Trade  execution  group.  These  transactions,  which
are  not  limited  to  foreign  exchange,  generate  revenue  via
commissions  charged  for  trades  transacted  during  the
management of these portfolios.
Securities Finance
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors
managed  investment  funds  with  a  broad  range  of  investment
objectives,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  State  Street  Global  Advisors
lending funds;
(2)  an  agency  lending  program  for  third-party  investment
managers  and  asset  owners,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  agency
lending funds; and
(3)  security  lending  transactions  which  we  enter  into  as
principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
Securities  finance  revenue  earned  from  our  agency  lendingactivities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads relatedto  cash  collateral  and  the  fees  related  to  non-cash  collateral,  isprincipally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interestrate  spreads  and  fees  earned  on  the  underlying  collateral  and  ourshare of the fee split.
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securitiesfrom  the  lending  client  or  other  market  participants  and then  lendssuch  securities  to  the  subsequent  borrower,  either  our  client  or  abroker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending client is unableto, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute thetransaction  and  furnish  the  securities.  In  our  role  as  principal,  weprovide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While wesource a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in ourrole  as  principal  from  third  parties,  we  have  the  ability  to  sourcesecurities  through  assets  under  custody  from  clients  who  havedesignated us as an eligible borrower.
Securities  finance  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, decreased 29% and27%  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily drivenby  decreases  in  enhanced  custody  balances  due  to  clientdeleveraging  and  lower  agency  lending  revenues  due  to  lowerspreads and reinvestment yields. Market influences may continue toaffect  client  demand  for  securities  finance,  and  as  a  result  ourrevenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activitiesin  future  periods.  In  addition,  the  constantly  evolving  regulatoryenvironment,  including  revised  or  proposed  capital  and  liquiditystandards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balancesheet management activities, may influence modifications to the wayin  which  we  deliver  our  agency  lending  or  enhanced  custodybusinesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and relatedrevenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing FeesSoftware  and processing  fees revenue includes diverse typesof  fees  and  revenue,  including  fees  from  software  licensing  andmaintenance, fees from our structured products business and otherrevenue including equity income from our joint venture investments,gains  and  losses  on  sales  of  other  assets,  market-relatedadjustments  and  income  associated  with  certain  tax-advantagedinvestments.
Software  and  processing  fees  revenue,  presented  in  Table  10:Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 16% and9%  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due tohigher CRD revenues.
State Street Corporation | 23
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSWe acquired CRD on October 1, 2018. Revenue related to the
front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale
of  term  software  licenses  and  software  as  service  arrangements,
including  professional  services  such  as  consulting  and
implementation  services,  software  support  and  maintenance.
Approximately  50%-70%  of  revenue  associated  with  a  sale  of
software to be installed on-premise is recognized at a point in time
when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the
software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of
the contract and other contractual terms. The remainder of revenue
for  on-premise  installations  is  recognized  over  the  length  of  the
contract  as  maintenance  and  other  services  are  provided.    Upon
renewal  of  an  on-premises  software  contract,  the  same  pattern  of
revenue  recognition  is  followed  with  50%-70%  recognized  upon
renewal and the balance recognized over the term of the contract.
Revenue  for  a Software  as a Service  (SaaS)  related  arrangement,
where  the  customer  does  not  take  possession  of  the  software,  is
recognized  over  the  term  of  the  contract  as  services  are  provided.
Upon  renewal  of  a  SaaS  arrangement,  revenue  continues  to  be
recognized  as  services  are  provided  under  the  new  contract.  As  a
result  of  these  differences  in  how  portions  of  CRD  revenue  are
accounted  for,  CRD  revenue  may  vary  more  than  other  business
units quarter to quarter.
CRD contributed approximately $89 million and $314 million in
total  revenue  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,
2020, respectively, compared to $81 million and $264 million in the
same  periods  in  2019,  respectively.  The  increase  in  revenue  is
primarily driven by SaaS revenue and professional services fees.
Amortization of tax advantage investments negatively impacted
software and processing fees by $24 million and $67 million in the
three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,
compared to $19 million and $39 million in the same periods in 2019,
respectively.
In  addition,  FX  and  market-related  adjustments  impacted
software  and  processing  fees  by  approximately  $7  million  and
($12)  million  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,
2020,  respectively,  compared  to  ($14)  million  and $1  million  in  the
same periods in 2019, respectively.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing decreased 1% in both
the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same periods in 2019,primarily  due  to  resource  discipline  initiatives  and  vendor  savings,partially  offset  by  technology  infrastructure  and  operationalinvestments.
CRD contributed approximately $62 million and $181 million intotal expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30,2020, respectively, compared to $56 million and $143 million in thesame  periods  in  2019,  respectively.  In  addition,  CRD-relatedexpenses include $17 million and $50 million in amortization of otherintangible assets in the three and nine months ended September 30,2020,  respectively,  compared  to  $17  million  and  $49  million  in  thesame periods in 2019, respectively.

State Street Corporation | 26
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFINANCIAL CONDITION
The  structure  of  our  consolidated  statement  of  condition  is
primarily  driven  by  the  liabilities  generated  by  our  Investment
Servicing  and  Investment  Management  lines  of  business.  Our
clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet
volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide  cash  management  and  investment  activities,  they  utilize
deposits  and  short-term  investments  that  constitute  the  majority  of
our  liabilities.  These  liabilities  are  generally  in  the  form  of  interestbearing  transaction  account  deposits,  which  are  denominated  in  a
variety  of  currencies;  non-interest-bearing  demand  deposits;  and
repurchase  agreements,  which  generally  serve  as  short-terminvestment alternatives for our clients.
Deposits  and  other  liabilities  resulting  from  client  initiated
transactions  are  invested  in  assets  that  generally  have  contractual
maturities  significantly  longer  than  our  liabilities;  however,  we
evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain
appropriate  short-term  liquidity  of  those  liabilities  that  are  not
operational  in  nature  and  maintain  longer-termed  assets  for  our
operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held
in  our  AFS  or  HTM  portfolios  and  short-duration  financial
instruments,  such  as  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and
securities  purchased  under  resale  agreements.  The  actual  mix  of
assets is influenced by the characteristics of the client liabilities and
our  desire  to  maintain  a  well-diversified  portfolio  of  high-quality
assets.

Additional information about our investment securities portfolio,
including our allowance for credit losses on investment securities, is
provided  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  this
Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the
interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in
the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of
condition,  in  consideration  of  the  global  interest  rate  environment.
We  consider  a  well-diversified,  high-credit  quality  investment
securities portfolio to be an important element in the
management of our consolidated statement of condition.Average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 2.9years and 2.7 years as of September 30, 2020 and December 31,2019,  respectively.  The  increase  in  securities  duration  is  primarilydriven  by  continued  growth  in  the  investment  portfolio  and  thematurity  of  the  short-dated  MMLF  securities.  Excluding  HTMsecurities  purchased  under  the  MMLF  program,  the  averageduration of our investment securities portfolio was 3.0 years and 2.7years  as  of  September  30,  2020  and  December  31,  2019,respectively.
As presented in the table below, approximately 91% and 90%of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated “AAA” or “AA” as ofSeptember  30,  2020  and  December  31,  2019,  respectively,excluding  the  securities  purchased  under  the  MMLF  program.  TheFederal  Reserve  has  taken  on  the  credit  risk  of  the  assetspurchased under the MMLF program, including municipal securities.The  securities  purchased  under  the  MMLF  program  were  primarilyshort-duration securities.

capital call finance loans and $860 million loans to business development companies as of September 30, 2020,
compared to $6,040 million loans to real money funds, $6,076 million private equity capital call finance loans
and $932 million loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2019.

loans as of September 30, 2020 and $2,537 million securities finance loans, $848 million loans to municipalities
and $26 million other loans as of December 31, 2019.
The increase in loans in the commercial and financial segment
as  of  September  30,  2020  compared  to  December  31,  2019  was
primarily driven by higher levels of client overdrafts and fund finance
loans, partially offset by a decrease in securities finance loans.
As  of  September  30,  2020  and  December  31,  2019,  our
leveraged  loans,  totaled  approximately  $4.26  billion  and  $4.46
billion, respectively. We continued selective de-risking actions in the
leveraged  loan  portfolio,  selling  $55  million  and  $271  million
leveraged loans in the three and nine
months  ended  September  30,  2020,  respectively,  of  which  $10million  remained  unsettled  and  was  held  for  sale  as  of  September30,  2020.  We  recorded  losses  on  the  sale  of  these  loans  of$11  million  and  $29  million  in  the  three  and  nine  months  endedSeptember  30,  2020,  respectively.  In  addition,  we  had  bindingunfunded  commitments  as  of  September  30,  2020  andDecember 31, 2019 of $53 million and $176 million, respectively, toparticipate  in such syndications.  Additional information  about theseunfunded  commitments  is  provided  in  Note  9  to  the  consolidatedfinancial statements in this Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative”under  our  internal  risk-rating  framework  (refer  to  Note  4  to  theconsolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q), are externallyrated  “BBB,”  “BB”  or  “B,”  with  approximately  84%  and  86%  of  theloans rated “BB” or “B” as of September 30, 2020 and December 31,2019,  respectively.  Our  investment  strategy  involves  generallylimiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten bymajor  global  financial  institutions,  applying  our  internal  creditanalysis  process  to  each  potential  investment  and  diversifying  ourexposure  by  counterparty  and  industry  segment.  However,  theseloans  have  significant  exposure  to  credit  losses  relative  to  higherrated loans in our portfolio.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs  discussed  above,  we  adopted  ASU  2016-13  in  January
2020. For additional information on this new standard, refer to Note
1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
The  provision  for  credit  losses  related  to  loans  and  financial
assets  held  at  amortized  cost,  including  investment  securities
classified as HTM and off-balance sheet commitments, was nil in the
three months ended September 30, 2020 and $88 million in the nine
months  ended  September  30,  2020,  based  on  the  CECL
methodology,  compared  to  $2  million  and  $7  million  in  the  same
periods  in  2019,  respectively  (which  were  under  the  previous
incurred loss model). Additional information is provided in Note 4 to
the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  this  Form  10-Q.  For
additional  information  on  the  previous  loss  model,  please  refer  to
Note 4 of the 2019 Form 10-K.
As  of  September  30,  2020,  approximately  $106  million  of  our
allowance for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included
in the commercial and financial segment compared to $61 million as
of  September  30,  2019,  reflecting  changes  in  reserving  standards
and economic outlook, as well as negative credit migration. As our
view  on  current  and  future  economic  scenarios  change,  our
allowance for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted
through a change to the provisions for credit losses, reflecting credit
migration  within  our  loan  portfolio,  as  well  as  changes  in
management's  economic  outlook  as  of  quarter-end.  The  remaining
$47  million  and  $10  million  as  of  September  30,  2020  and  2019,
respectively,  was  related  to  off-balance  sheet  commitments  and
other  financial  assets  held  at  amortized  cost,  including  investment
securities held to maturity.
An allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities
upon acquisition of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair
value  and  expected  future  cash  flows  of  the  investment  securities
are less than their amortized cost basis. Please refer to Note 3 to the
consolidated  financial  statements  in  this  Form  10-Q  for  additional
information. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of
economic  and  security-specific  factors.  Such  factors  are  based  on
estimates,  derived  by  management,  which  contemplate  current
market  conditions  and  security-specific  performance.  To  the  extent
that  market  conditions  are  worse  than  management's  expectations
or  due  to  idiosyncratic  bond  performance,  the  credit-related
component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would be
recorded in the provision for credit losses. Additional information with
respect to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment losses and
gross  unrealized  losses  is  provided  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated
financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border OutstandingsCross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by nonU.S. counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or othernon-local  currency,  as  well  as  non-U.S.  local  currency  claims  notfunded  by  local  currency  liabilities.  Our  cross-border  outstandingsconsist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing,including  short-duration  advances;  investment  securities;  amountsrelated to FX and interest rate contracts; and securities finance. Inaddition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that,as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowersmay  be  unable  to  meet  their  contractual  repayment  obligations  ofprincipal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, orrestrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.As  market  and  economic  conditions  change,  the  majorindependent  credit  rating  agencies  may  downgrade  U.S.  and  nonU.S.  financial  institutions  and  sovereign  issuers  which  have  been,and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whosefinancial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for creditrisk  mitigation  purposes,  and  may  do  so  again  in  the  future.  As  aresult, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading tonegative ratings volatility.
The  cross-border  outstandings  presented  in  Table  28:  Crossborder  outstandings,  represented  approximately  28%  of  ourconsolidated  total  assets  as  of  both  September  30,  2020  andDecember 31, 2019.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs  of  September  30,  2020,  aggregate  cross-border
outstandings  in  Switzerland  and  Belgium  amounted  to  between
0.75%  and  1%  of  our  consolidated  assets,  at  approximately  $2.71
billion  and  $2.20  billion,  respectively.  As  of  December  31,  2019,
aggregate  cross-border  outstandings  in  the  Netherlands  amounted
to  between  0.75%  and  1%  of  our  consolidated  assets,  at
approximately $1.89 billion.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our global business activities,  we are
exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services
industry,  others  more  specific  to  our  business  activities.  Our  risk
management framework focuses on material risks, which include the
following: • credit and counterparty risk; • liquidity risk, funding and management; • operational risk; • information technology risk; • market risk associated with our trading activities; • market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which
we  refer  to  as  asset-and-liability  management,  and  which
consists primarily of interest rate risk; • model risk; • strategic risk; and
• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying
each  of  these  risks  that  could  affect  our  businesses  and  our
consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail on pages
18 to 47 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2019 Form 10-
K, and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
For  additional  information  about  our  risk  management,
including our risk appetite framework and risk governance committee
structure,  refer  to  pages  80  to  84  included  under  Item  7,
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and
Results of Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019
Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We  define  credit  risk  as  the  risk  of  financial  loss  if  a
counterparty,  borrower  or  obligor,  collectively  referred  to  as  a
counterparty,  is  either  unable  or  unwilling  to  repay  borrowings  or
settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms.
We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities,
such  as  loans  and  contingent  commitments,  in  our  investment
securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in
our direct and indirect trading activities, such as securities
purchased  under  a  resale  agreement,  principal  securities  lendingand FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also assumecredit  risk  in  our  day-to-day  treasury  and  securities  and  othersettlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and othercash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions andfees receivables.
Allowance for Credit LossesWe maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our onbalance  sheet  credit  exposures,  including  financial  assets  held  atamortized  cost  and  investment  securities  held-to-maturity.  We  alsomaintain  an  allowance  for  unfunded  commitments  and  letters  ofcredit  to  support  our  off-balance  credit  exposure.  The  twocomponents  together  represent  the  allowance  for  credit  losses.Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for creditlosses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly,and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level ofrisk in the portfolio, and reasonable and supportable forecasts andtheir effect on our counterparties in our expectation of credit losses.We  utilize  multiple  economic  scenarios,  consisting  of  a  baseline,upside and downside scenario, to develop management’s forecast offuture expected losses.
The  economic  forecast  utilized  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020reflects  slightly  improving  economic  forecasts  and  limited  negativecredit  migration.  However,  the  economic  forecast  remains  highlyuncertain,  particularly  since  future  economic  activity  remainsdependent on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If future dataand forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determineour allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2020, or if creditrisk  migration  is  higher  or  lower  than  forecasted  for  reasonsindependent  of  the  economic  forecast,  our  allowance  for  creditlosses will also change.

State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSand  early  warning  indicators  and  perform  routine  stress  testing  to
identify potential liquidity needs. This process involves the evaluation
of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in
measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases
in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as
the  potential  impairment  of  our  ability  to  access  the  global  capital
markets.
We  manage  our  liquidity  on  a  global,  consolidated  basis.  We
also  manage  liquidity  on  a  stand-alone  basis  at  the  Parent
Company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of State
Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and
funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market
and the Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower
market access. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or
has  direct  access  to,  primarily  through  SSIF,  a  direct  subsidiary  of
the  Parent  Company,  and  the  support  agreement,  as  discussed  in
the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and
Analysis, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash
needs,  as  well  as  those  projected  over  the  next  one-year  period.
Reference  our  SPOE  Strategy  as  discussed  in  the  "Uses  of
Liquidity"  section  of  this  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis.
Absent  financial  distress  at  the  Parent  Company,  the  liquid  assets
available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company.
As  of  September  30,  2020,  the  Parent  Company  and  State  Street
Bank had approximately $1.51 billion of senior notes or subordinated
debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk
management  activities  are  subject  to  heightened  and  evolving
regulatory  requirements,  including  interpretations  of  those
requirements, under specific U.S. and international regulations and
also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory
activities,  such  as  stress  tests,  resolution  planning,  examinations
and other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements
could,  in  some  cases,  result  in  changes  in  the  composition  of  our
investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of
certain  business  activities  or  modifications  to  the  way  in  which  we
deliver  our  products  and  services.  If  we  fail  to  meet  regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive
negative  regulatory  stress  test  results,  incur  a  resolution  plan
deficiency  or  determination  of  a  non-credible  resolution  plan  or
otherwise  receive  an  adverse  regulatory  finding.  Our  efforts  to
satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, aswell as liquidity risk metrics, refer to pages 89 to 93 included underItem  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition  and  Results  of  Operation,  in  our  2019  Form  10-K.  Foradditional information on our liquidity ratios, including LCR and thenet  stable  funding  ratio,  refer  to  page  9  included  under  Item  1,Business, in our 2019 Form 10-K.
Asset LiquidityCentral  to  the  management  of  our  liquidity  is  asset  liquidity,which  consists  primarily  of  unencumbered  highly  liquid  securities,cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statement ofcondition. We restrict the eligibility of securities to be characterizedas asset liquidity to U.S. Government and federal agency securities(including  MBS),  securities  of  selected  non-U.S.  Governments  andsupranational  organizations  as  well  as  certain  other  high-qualitysecurities which generally are more liquid than other types of assetseven in times of stress. As a banking organization, we are subject toa  minimum  LCR  of  100%  under  the  LCR  rule  approved  by  U.S.banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the short-termresilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, toimprove the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising frommarket  stress  over  a  30  calendar  day  period  and  improve  themeasurement and management of liquidity risk. The LCR measuresan institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows. HQLA primarilyconsists  of  unencumbered  cash  and  certain  high  quality  liquidsecurities  that  qualify  for  inclusion  under  the  LCR  rule.  We  reportLCR  to  the  Federal  Reserve  daily.  For  the  quarters  endedSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, daily average LCR forthe  Parent  Company  was  109%  and  110%,  respectively.  Theaverage HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR final rule was$130.95 billion and $100.23 billion, post-prescribed haircuts, for thequarters  ended  September  30,  2020  and  December  31,  2019,respectively.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatoryrequirements  governing  deposits  with  the  Federal  Reserve  ofapproximately  $68.46  billion  at  the  Federal  Reserve,  the  ECB  andother  non-U.S.  central  banks  for  the  quarter  ended September  30,2020,  compared  to  $41.56  billion  for  the  quarter  endedDecember  31,  2019. The  higher  levels  of  average  cash  balanceswith central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securitiespledged without corresponding advances from the Federal ReserveBank of Boston (FRBB), the FHLB and other non-U.S. central banks.State Street Bank is a member of the FHLB. ThisState Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSmembership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against
high-quality  collateral,  which  helps  facilitate  asset-and-liability
management.  As  of  September  30,  2020,  we  had  approximately
$5  billion  of  outstanding  borrowings  from  the  FHLB.  As  of
December  31,  2019,  we  had  no  outstanding  borrowings  from  the
FHLB.
Access  to  primary,  intra-day  and  contingent  liquidity  provided
by  these  utilities  is  an  important  source  of  contingent  liquidity  with
utilization  subject  to  underlying  conditions.  As  of  September  30,
2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding primary credit
borrowings from the FRBB discount window.
In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we
have  significant  amounts  of  other  unencumbered  investment
securities.  These  securities  are  available  sources  of  liquidity,
although  not  as  rapidly  deployed  as  those  included  in  our  asset
liquidity.
The  average  fair  value  of  total  unencumbered  securities  was
$80.77 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 compared
to $76.94 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following:
withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of
lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; or
other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise
under  stress  conditions  including  deterioration  in  credit  ratings.  A
recurring  significant  use  of  our liquidity  involves  our  deployment  of
HQLA  from  our  investment  portfolio  to  post  collateral  to  financial
institutions  serving  as  sources  of  securities  under  our  enhanced
custody program.
We  had  unfunded  commitments  to  extend  credit  with  gross
contractual  amounts  totaling  $33.74  billion  and  $29.70  billion  and
standby letters of credit totaling $3.24 billion and $3.32 billion as of
September  30,  2020  and  December  31,  2019,  respectively.  These
amounts  do  not  reflect  the  value  of  any  collateral.  As  of
September  30,  2020,  approximately  73%  of  our  unfunded
commitments  to  extend  credit  and  17%  of  our  standby  letters  of
credit  expire  within  one year.  Since  many  of  our  commitments  are
expected  to  expire  or  renew  without  being  fully  drawn  upon,  the
gross  contractual  amounts  do  not  necessarily  represent  our  future
cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
State  Street,  like  other  bank  holding  companies  with  total
consolidated  assets  of  $50  billion  or  more,  periodically  submits  a
plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial
distress or failure, commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a
living  will,  to  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  FDIC  under  Section165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek,in the event of our insolvency, to maintain State Street Bank’s roleas  a  key  infrastructure  provider  within  the  financial  system,  whileminimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for thebenefit  of  our  stakeholders.  We  have  and  will  continue  to  focusmanagement  attention  and  resources  to  meet  regulatoryexpectations with respect to resolution planning.We  submitted  our  updated  2019  165(d)  resolution  plandescribing our preferred resolution strategy to the Federal Reserveand  FDIC  (the  Agencies)  before  July  1,  2019,  and  our  resolutionstrategy is materially consistent with our prior resolution strategy. Inreviewing  the  2019  plan,  the  Agencies  noted  meaningfulimprovements  over  prior  plan  submissions.  The  Agencies  did  notidentify  any  deficiencies  in  the  2019  plan,  but  did  identify  oneshortcoming  related  to  the  implementation  of  governancemechanisms.  We  submitted  to  the Agencies  our  plan to  remediatethis shortcoming in line with the expected timeframe. In addition tothe above letter, the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly issued a finalrule  that  was  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  November  1,2019.  This final rule revised the implementation requirements underthe  Dodd  Frank  Act's  resolution  planning  provisions  by  means  ofestablishing  a  biennial  filing  cycle  for  the  U.S.  G-SIBs,  includingState  Street.  This  cycle  alternates  between  a  targeted  resolutionplan, followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agencieshave published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan,to  include  the  core  elements  of  resolution  planning  and  somespecific firm level information, including impacts from the COVID-19pandemic. The next resolution plan is due on July 1, 2021.In  the  event  of  material  financial  distress  or  failure,  ourpreferred  resolution  strategy  is  the  SPOE  Strategy.  For  additionalinformation  about  the  SPOE  Strategy,  refer  to  pages  12  to  14included under Item 1, Business, in our 2019 Form 10-K. The SPOEStrategy  provides  that  prior  to  the  bankruptcy  of  the  ParentCompany and pursuant to a support agreement among the ParentCompany,  SSIF,  our  Beneficiary  Entities  (as  defined  below)  andcertain  other  of  our  entities,  SSIF  is  obligated,  up  to  its  availableresources,  to  recapitalize  and/or  provide  liquidity  to  State  StreetBank  and  our  other  entities  benefiting  from  such  capital  and/orliquidity (collectively with State Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), inamounts  designed  to  prevent  the  Beneficiary  Entities  fromthemselves  entering  into  resolution  proceedings.  Following  therecapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities,the Parent Company would enter into a bankruptcyState Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSproceeding  under  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code.  The  Beneficiary
Entities  and  our  subsidiaries  would  be  transferred  to  a  newly
organized  holding  company  held  by  a  reorganization  trust  for  the
benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under  the  support  agreement,  the  Parent  Company  has  prefunded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid
assets, cash deposits, debt investments, investments in marketable
securities  and other  cash and non-cash  equivalent  investments)  to
SSIF  contemporaneous  with  entering  into  the  support  agreement
and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent available,
on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF
has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in
accordance with the Parent Company’s capital and liquidity policies.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company is only permitted
to  retain  certain  amounts  of  cash  needed  to  meet  its  upcoming
obligations  and  to  fund  expenses  during  a  potential  bankruptcy
proceeding.  SSIF  has  provided  the  Parent  Company  with  a
committed  credit  line  and  issued  (and  may  issue)  one  or  more
promissory  notes  to  the  Parent  Company  (the  Parent  Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow us to continue to
meet our obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of
a  "Recapitalization  Event"  (as  defined  below).  The  support
agreement does not contemplate that SSIF is obligated to maintain
any  specific  level  of  resources  and  SSIF  may  not  have  sufficient
resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
In  the  event  a  Recapitalization  Event  occurs,  the  obligations
outstanding  under  the  Parent  Company  Funding  Notes  would
automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to
SSIF.  The  obligations  of  the  Parent  Company  and  SSIF  under  the
support  agreement  are  secured  through  a  security  agreement  that
grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would
use  to  fulfill  their  obligations  under  the  support  agreement  to  the
Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the
Parent Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with its policies, we are required to monitor, on
an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank
and the other Beneficiary Entities. To support this process, we have
established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would
need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain
events  tied  to  our  financial  condition  occur.  In  the  event  that  we
experience  material  financial  distress,  the  support  agreement
requires  us  to  model  and  calculate  certain  capital  and  liquidity
triggers on a regular basis to
determine  whether  or  not  the  Parent  Company  should  commencepreparations  for  a  bankruptcy  filing  and  whether  or  not  aRecapitalization Event has occurred.
Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Recapitalization  Event:  (1)  SSIFwould not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the ParentCompany; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contributeto  SSIF  any  remaining  assets  it  is  required  to  contribute  to  SSIFunder the support agreement; (3) SSIF would be required to providecapital  and  liquidity  support  to  the  Beneficiary  Entities  to  supportsuch  entities’  continued  operation;  and  (4)  the  Parent  Companywould be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under theU.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to thesupport  agreement,  should  rely,  including  in  evaluating  any  of  ourentities from a creditor's perspective or determining whether to enterinto a contractual relationship with any of our entities, on any of ouraffiliates being or remaining a Beneficiary Entity or receiving capitalor liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement.A  “Recapitalization  Event”  is  defined  under  the  supportagreement  as  the  earlier  occurrence  of  one  or  more  capital  andliquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the ParentCompany's  Board  of  Directors  for  the  Parent  Company  tocommence  bankruptcy  proceedings.  These  thresholds  are  set  atlevels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital andliquidity  to  enable  an  orderly  resolution  without  extraordinarygovernment support. The SPOE Strategy and the obligations underthe  support  agreement  may  result  in  the  recapitalization  of  StateStreet Bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings bythe Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than mightotherwise  occur  without  such  mechanisms  in  place.  An  expectedeffect  of  the  SPOE  Strategy  and  applicable  TLAC  regulatoryrequirements is that losses will be imposed on the Parent Companyshareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms ofTLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by theParent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors,before  any  of  its  losses  are  imposed  on  the  holders  of  the  debtsecurities of the Parent Company's operating subsidiaries or any oftheir depositors or creditors, or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk.There  can  be  no  assurance  that  credit  rating  agencies,  inresponse to our 2019 resolution plan or the support agreement, willnot downgrade, place on negative watch or change their outlook onour debt credit ratings, generally or on specific debt securities. Anysuch downgrade, placement on negative watch or change in outlookcould adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to thecapital markets or result in restrictive covenants in future debtState Street Corporation | 35
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSagreements  and could  also  adversely  impact  the  trading  prices,  or
the liquidity, of our outstanding debt securities.
State  Street  Bank  is  also  required  to  submit,  periodically  in
accordance  with applicable regulations  and FDIC  guidance,  a plan
for  resolution  in  the  event  of  its  failure,  referred  to  as  an  Insured
Depository  Institution  (IDI)  plan.  On  April  22,  2019,  the  Federal
Register  published  the  FDIC’s  advance  notice  of  proposed
rulemaking in which it invited comment on potential revisions to its
IDI plan requirements. In addition to this advance notice of proposed
rulemaking,  on  April  16,  2019,  the  FDIC  Board  voted  to  delay  the
next  round  of  submissions  under  the  IDI  Rule  until  the  rulemaking
process has been completed. On May 20, 2020, the FDIC released
a  statement  notifying  of  its  plan  to  issue  a  proposal  in  the  current
year that may require the submission of a targeted IDI plan in 2021.
Funding
Deposits
We  provide  products  and  services  including  custody,
accounting,  administration,  daily  pricing,  FX  services,  cash
management,  financial  asset  management,  securities  finance  and
investment  advisory  services.  As  a  provider  of  these  products  and
services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided
a  stable,  low-cost  source  of  funds.  As  a  global  custodian,  clients
place  deposits  with  our  entities  in  various  currencies.  As  of  both
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximately 60% of
our  average  total  deposit  balances  were  denominated  in  U.S.
dollars,  approximately  20%  in  EUR,  10%  in  GBP  and  10%  in  all
other currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our  on-balance  sheet  liquid  assets  are  also  an  integral
component  of  our  liquidity  management  strategy.  These  assets
provide  liquidity  through  maturities  of  the  assets,  but  more
importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging
the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales.
In  addition,  our  access  to  the  global  capital  markets  gives  us  the
ability  to  source  incremental  funding  from  wholesale  investors.  As
discussed  earlier  under  “Asset  Liquidity,”  State  Street  Bank's
membership in the FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying
terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities
lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are
short-term  in  nature,  generally  overnight  and  are  collateralized  by
high-quality investment securities. These balances were $2.43 billion
and $1.10 billion as of
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.State  Street  Bank  currently  maintains  a  line  of  credit  with  afinancial  institution  of  CAD  1.40  billion,  or  approximately  $1.05billion, as of September 30, 2020, to support its Canadian securitiesprocessing  operations.  The  line of credit  has  no stated  terminationdate and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of bothSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was no balanceoutstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term FundingWe  have  the  ability  to  issue  debt  and  equity  securities  underour  current  universal  shelf  registration  statement  to  meet  currentcommitments  and  business  needs,  including  accommodating  thetransaction and cash management needs of our clients. In addition,State Street Bank also has current authorization from the Board toissue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt.Agency Credit RatingsOur ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fosteredby the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measuredby the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential tomaintaining high credit ratings include: • diverse and stable core earnings; • relative market position; • strong risk management; • strong capital ratios; • diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital marketsand client deposits; • strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;• increasing  the  potential  market  for  our  debt  and  improvingour ability to offer products; • serving markets; and• engaging  in  transactions  in  which  clients  value  high  creditratings.
A  downgrade  or  reduction  of  our  credit  ratings  could  have  amaterial  adverse  effect  on  our  liquidity  by  restricting  our  ability  toaccess the capital markets, which could increase the related cost offunds.  In  turn,  this  could  cause  the  sudden  and  large-scalewithdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead todraw-downs  of  unfunded  commitments  to  extend  credit  or  triggerrequirements under securities purchase commitments; or requireState Street Corporation | 36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSadditional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative
contracts.
A  majority  of  our  derivative  contracts  have  been  entered  into
under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us
to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in
our credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by
determining  the  collateral  that  would  be  required  assuming  a
downgrade  by  all  rating  agencies.  The  additional  collateral  or
termination  payments  related  to  our  net  derivative  liabilities  under
these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in
the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified
in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements  in  this  Form  10-Q.  Other  funding  sources,  such  as
secured  financing  transactions  and  other  margin  requirements,  for
which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, human error and systems or from external
events.
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted business
continuity arrangements across our operating locations and we and
a significant  percentage  of  our key  service  providers  are  operating
significantly or entirely in a work from home environment. Due to the
related  market  disruption,  we  have  also  been  processing  a
historically high volume of transactions on behalf of our clients. Both
the  operating  environment  and  market  dynamics  increase
operational  risk  and  information  technology  risk,  including  cyberthreats.    See  also  “Information  Technology  Risk  Management”
below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework,
refer  to  pages  93  to  97  included  under  Item  7,  Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of
Operations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We  define  information  technology  risk  as  the  risk  associated
with  the  use,  ownership,  operation,  involvement,  influence  and
adoption  of  information  technology.  Information  technology  risk
includes  risks  triggered  by  technology  non-compliance  with
regulatory  obligations,  information  security  and  privacy  incidents,
business  disruption,  technology  internal  control  and  process  gaps,
technology  operational  events  and  adoption  of  new  business
technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk
framework,  refer  to  pages  97  to  98  included  under  Item  7,
Management's Discussion and
Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  "RiskManagement", in our 2019 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk ofloss  that  could  result  from  broad  market  movements,  such  aschanges  in  the  general  level  of  interest  rates,  credit  spreads,  FXrates  or  commodity  prices.  We  are  exposed  to  market  risk  in  bothour  trading  and  certain  of  our  non-trading,  or  asset  and  liabilitymanagement activities.
Information  about  the  market  risk  associated  with  our  tradingactivities  is  provided  below  under  “Trading  Activities.”  Informationabout  the  market  risk  associated  with  our  non-trading  activities,which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under“Asset and Liability Management Activities.”Trading ActivitiesIn the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk,the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, businessobjectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and marketvolatility, and our execution against those factors.For additional information about the market risk associated withour trading activities, refer to pages 98 to 99 included under Item 7,Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  andResults of Operations, in our 2019 Form 10-K.As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the FXand  interest-rate  markets  by  buying  and  selling  cash  instrumentsand  entering  into  derivative  instruments,  including  FX  forwardcontracts,  FX  and  interest-rate  options  and  interest  rate  swaps,interest  rate  forward  contracts,  and  interest  rate  futures.  As  ofSeptember  30,  2020,  the  notional  amount  of  these  derivativecontracts was $2.79 trillion, of which $2.78 trillion was composed ofFX  forward,  swap  and spot  contracts.  We  seek  to  match  positionsclosely  with  the  objective  of tightly  controlling  related  currency  andinterest rate risk. All FX contracts are valued daily at current marketrates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSValue-at-Risk and Stressed Value-at-Risk
We  use  a  variety  of  risk  measurement  tools  and
methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss
for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We
use  a  risk  measurement  methodology  to  measure  trading  related
VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading related
VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated
with  currently  applicable  bank  regulatory  market  risk  requirements.
Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period
calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-businessday holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same
model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to
historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that
reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model identifies
the  second-worst  outcome  occurring  in  the  worst  continuous  oneyear  rolling  period  since  July  2007.  This  stressed  VaR  meets  the
regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome
that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month
period  of  financial  stress.  For  each  portfolio,  the  stress  period  is
determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that
produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available
historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of
2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign
debt crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury
debt in August 2011. As the historical data set used to determine the
stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be
automatically incorporated.
For  additional  information  about  our  VaR  measurement  tools

Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that
incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we
could  suffer  in  a  hypothetical  scenario  of  adverse  economic  and
financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as
concentration  by  branch,  risk  component,  and  currency  pairs.  We
conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical
stress events that are relevant to
our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our currentportfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also performstress  testing  as  part  of  the  Federal  Reserve's  CCAR  process.Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate,trading  desk,  division  and  risk-factor  level  (for  example,  exchangerisk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress  testing  results  and  limits  are  actively  monitored  on  adaily basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported tothe  Trading  and  Markets  Risk  Committee  (TMRC).  Limit  breachesare  addressed  by  ERM  risk  managers  in  conjunction  with  thebusiness  units,  escalated  as  appropriate,  and  reviewed  by  theTMRC  if  material.  In  addition,  we  have  established  several  actiontriggers that prompt review by management and the implementationof a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-TestingWe perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of ourVaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level.This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR modeloutputs to daily, actual P&L outcomes, observed from daily marketmovements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, whichexcludes  non-trading  revenue  such  as  fees,  commissions  and  NII,as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are notspecific  to  the  price  movement  of  the  trading  assets  and  liabilitiesthemselves,  such  as  fees,  commissions,  changes  to  reserves  andgains or losses from intra-day activity.
We  had  no  back-testing  exceptions  in  the  quarters  endedSeptember 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associatedwith  our  trading  activities  for  covered  positions  held  during  thequarters ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September30,  2019.  A  covered  position  is  generally  defined  by  U.S.  bankingregulators as an on-or off-balance sheet position associated with theorganization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on itstradability,  but  does  not  include  intangible  assets,  certain  creditderivatives  recognized  as  guarantees  and  certain  equity  positionsnot publicly traded.
Diversification  effect  in  the  table  below  represents  thedifference  between  total  VaR  and  the  sum  of  the  VaRs  for  eachtrading activity. This effect arises because the trading activities arenot perfectly correlated.

The increase in the average stressed VaR compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributed to higher foreign exchangeand interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite fortaking  market  risk  in  our  trading  activities.  Overall  levels  of  volatility  have  been  low,  both  on  an  absolute  basis  and  relative  to  the  historicalinformation observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations.
We may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory reviewand approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAsset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting theeconomic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates.While many market  factors  affect  the level of NII and the economic value of our assets  and liabilities,  one of the most  significant  factors  is ourexposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We investthese client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of oursignificant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balancesheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internalforecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Table 33, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-monthforward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019. Our September 30, 2020 baseline forecast assumesno changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.
TABLE 33: KEY INTEREST RATES FOR BASELINE FORECASTS
September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019Fed Funds Target 10-Year Treasury Fed Funds Target 10-Year TreasurySpot rates 0.25 % 0.69 %2.00 %1.66 %12-month forward rates 0.25 0.77 1.25  1.61 In Table 34: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks tovarious tenors on the yield curve, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken tomitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance. While investment securities balances can fluctuate with the levelof rates as prepayment assumptions change, our modeling approach in both the September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 reporting periodswas to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rate scenarios. In prior reporting periods this year, wedeviated from that approach for our +100 bps shock scenarios in light of the changing interest rate environment and fluctuating deposit balances. Inthe March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 reporting periods, client deposits were modeled to return to average balance levels experienced in the fourthquarter of 2019 with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents held with central banks. Given deposit stabilization in the third quarterof 2020, we no longer believe this deposit reduction is appropriate. Additionally, given the current low interest rate environment, our -100 bps shockscenarios are impacted by assumed floors as interest rates reach zero for certain currencies including the U.S. dollar scenarios.TABLE 34: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY

Compared to September 30,2019, our NII is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily driven by higher levels of deposits and assumptions for lower deposit betas. Ourpositioning to parallel rate decreases has shifted to benefit NII predominantly driven by either contractual or assumed floors as interest rates inseveral currencies approach zero, which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized.
State Street Corporation | 40
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSU.S. dollar NII as of September 30, 2020 remains positioned to
benefit  from  a parallel rise  in interest  rates  and to decline under a
parallel  decrease  in  interest  rates.  Compared  to  September  30,
2019,  our  U.S.  dollar  NII  benefit  to  higher  rates  has  increased
primarily due to higher levels of deposits and assumptions for lower
deposit betas. Compared to September 30, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII
sensitivity  to  lower  rates  has  improved  mainly  driven  by  either
contractual or assumed floors as U.S. interest rates approach zero
as  well  as  lower  long-end  rates  which  includes  the  effect  of
decreasing paydowns of investment securities.
NII  is  still  positioned  to  benefit  from  changes  in  non-U.S.
interest  rates  with  the  majority  of  our  sensitivity  derived  from  the
short-end of the curve given deposit pricing expectations. Compared
to  September  30,  2019,  our  non-U.S.  benefit  to  higher  rates  has
decreased  while  the  benefit  to  lower  rates  has  increased.  The
decreased  benefit  to  higher  rates  is  driven  by  higher  volumes  of
fixed  rate  securities  in  our  non-U.S.  investment  portfolio.  The
increased  benefit  to  lower  rates  is  mainly  driven  by  the  impact  of
contractual  floors  on  our  EUR  denominated  loan  and  securities
portfolio  compared  to  the  deposits  that  are  repricing  the  negative
rates.
EVE  sensitivity  is  a  discounted  cash  flow  model  designed  to
estimate  the  fair  value  of  assets  and  liabilities  under  a  series  of
interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. In the following table,
we report our EVE sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks,
relative to spot interest rates. Management compares the change in
EVE  sensitivity  against  our  aggregate  tier  1  and  tier  2  risk-based
capital,  calculated  in  conformity  with  current  applicable  regulatory
requirements. EVE sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest
and principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot
balance  sheet  and  does  not  include  the  impact  of  new  business
assumptions.

As of September 30, 2020, EVE sensitivity remains exposed to
upward  shifts  in  interest  rates.  Compared  to  September  30,  2019,
the  change  in  the  up  200  bps  instantaneous  shock  scenario  was
primarily driven by the benefit from increased liability duration fromdeposit  modeling  updates  and  hedging  activity,  partially  offset  by
increased  duration  in  our  securities  portfolio.  The  down  200  bps
instantaneous  shock  results  are  impacted  by  assumed  floors  as
interest rates in several currencies approach zero,
which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized.Both NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitoredas  market  conditions  change.

Model Risk Management
The  use  of  models  is  widespread  throughout  the  financialservices  industry,  with  large  and  complex  organizations  relying  onsophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financialdecision making.  The models contemporaneously  represent  both asignificant  advancement  in  financial  management  and  a  source  ofrisk. In large banking organizations like us, model results influencebusiness decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect onour financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk ManagementFramework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For  additional  information  about  our  model  risk  managementframework, including our governance and model validation, refer topages 105 to 106 included under Item 7, Management's Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "RiskManagement Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K.Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact onearnings  or  capital  arising  from  adverse  business  decisions,improper  implementation  of  strategic  initiatives,  or  lack  ofresponsiveness  to  industry-wide  changes.  Strategic  risks  areinfluenced  by  changes  in  the  competitive  environment;  decline  inmarket  performance  or  changes  in our  business  activities;  and thepotential  secondary  impacts  of  reputational  risks,  not  alreadycaptured  as  market,  interest  rate,  credit,  operational,  model  orliquidity  risks.  We  incorporate  strategic  risk  into  our  assessment  ofour  business  plans  and  risk  and  capital  management  processes.Active management of strategic risk is an integral component of allaspects of our business.
For additional information about our strategic risk managementframework, refer to page 106 included under Item 7, Management'sDiscussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  ofOperations, "Risk Management Framework", in our 2019 Form 10-K.State Street Corporation | 41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCapital
Managing  our  capital  involves  evaluating  whether  our  actual
and  projected  levels  of  capital  are  commensurate  with  our  risk
profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements
and  are  sufficient  to  provide  us  with  the  financial  flexibility  to
undertake  future  strategic  business  initiatives.  We  assess  capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well
as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as
evaluated  by  banking  regulators,  and  requires  us  to  maintain  an
additional  capital  surcharge  above  the  minimum  capital  ratios  set
forth in the Basel III rule. Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we are
also currently subject to a 2.0% leverage buffer under the Basel III
rule. If we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will
be  subject  to  increased  restrictions  (depending  upon  the  extent  of
the  shortfall)  regarding  capital  distributions  and  discretionary
executive bonus payments.
Not  all  of  our  competitors  have  similarly  been  designated  as
systemically  important  nor  are  all  of  them  subject  to  the  same
degree  of  regulation  as  a  bank  or  financial  holding  company,  and
therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same
capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 106
to  113  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  in  our
2019 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State  Street  Bank,  as advanced approaches  banking
organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. Provisions
of  the  Basel  III  rule  became  effective  with  full  implementation  on
January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the final market risk capital
rule issued by U.S. banking regulators effective as of January 2013.
The minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2020, including a
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%,
are  8.0%  for  CET1  capital,  9.5%  for  tier  1  risk-based  capital  and
11.5%  for  total  risk-based  capital.  Based  on  a  calculation  date  of
December 31, 2018, our G-SIB surcharge for 2020 was reduced to
1.0%. Based on a calculation date of December 31, 2019, our G-SIB
surcharge for 2021 will be 1.0%.
In August 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed that our SCB
will be 2.5% for the period starting on October 1, 2020 and ending
on  September  30,  2021,  resulting  in  no  change  to  our  capital
requirements.  Due  to  the  economic  challenges  created  by  the
COVID-19 pandemic, we and other participating
CCAR banks are required to resubmit our capital plans by November2, 2020 under updated scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve.Results  from  the  new  stress  test  are  expected  by  the  end  of  theyear, however, it is unclear whether or not the results will impact ourcalculated SCB. In line with the decision to administer a new stresstest, the Federal Reserve has continued its suspension of the abilityof  all  CCAR  banking  organizations  to  distribute  capital  beyondcommon dividends (at their current levels) through the fourth quarterof 2020.
To  maintain  the  status  of  the  Parent  Company  as  a  financialholding  company,  we  and  our  insured  depository  institutionsubsidiaries  are  required,  among  other  requirements,  to  be  "wellcapitalized"  as  defined  by  Regulation  Y  and  Regulation  H,respectively.
The  Basel  III  rule  provides  for  two  frameworks  for  monitoringcapital  adequacy:  the  “standardized  approach"  and  the  “advancedapproaches",  applicable  to  advanced  approaches  bankingorganizations,  like  us.  The  standardized  approach  prescribesstandardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified riskweights  for  certain  on-  and  off-balance  sheet  exposures.  Theadvanced  approaches  consist  of  the  Advanced  Internal  RatingsBased  Approach  used  for  the  calculation  of  RWA  related  to  creditrisk,  and  the  Advanced  Measurement  Approach  used  for  thecalculation of RWA related to operational risk.State Street Corporation | 42

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur CET1 capital increased $1.61 billion as of September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily driven by capital retained dueto limitations on capital distributions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the third quarter of2020 under current Federal Reserve requirements. We maintained our per share common dividend at $0.52 per share during the third quarter of2020. Additionally, our continued capital optimization efforts resulted in lower preferred stock dividends in the third quarter of 2020 compared to thesame period in 2019.
Our tier 1 capital increased $1.12 billion as of September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, due to the aforementioned increase in ourCET1 capital, which was partially offset by the redemption of all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock as of March 15,2020 at redemption price of $0.50 billion. Total capital increased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $1.02 billion and$1.05 billion, respectively, primarily due to the changes in our tier 1 and tier 2 capital. As described above, no share repurchases were executed inthe third quarter of 2020 and none will be executed in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The table below presents a roll-forward of CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and forthe year ended December 31, 2019.

As  of  September  30,  2020,  total  advanced  approaches  RWA  increased  $3.75  billion  compared  to  December  31,  2019,  mainly  due  to  anincrease in credit risk RWA, partially offset by a decrease in operational risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily due to an increasein wholesale investment securities RWA, loans RWA and all other RWA, partially offset by a decrease in OTC derivatives RWA. The decrease inoperational risk RWA was driven by a decline in the frequency of conduct and compliance loss events.
As  of  September  30,  2020,  total  standardized  approach  RWA  increased  $7.15  billion  compared  to  December  31,  2019,  mainly  due  to  anincrease in credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily due to an increase in loans RWA, wholesale investment securities RWA,all other RWA and OTC derivatives RWA, partially offset by a decrease in repo-style transactions RWA.
The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2020, presented in Table 36: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory CapitalRatios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the Basel III rule. The advanced approachesbased ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of September 30, 2020, based on our internaland external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,”in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report onForm  10-K.  Significant  components  of  these  advanced  systems  involve  the  exercise  of  judgment  by  us  and  our  regulators,  and  our  advancedsystems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which theyare designed or intended.
Our  advanced systems  are subject  to update and periodic  revalidation  in response  to changes in our business  activities  and our historicalexperiences,  forces  and  events  experienced  by  the  market  broadly  or  by  individual  financial  institutions,  changes  in  regulations  and  regulatoryinterpretations  and  other  factors,  and  are  also  subject  to  continuing  regulatory  review  and  approval.  For  example,  a  significant  operational  lossexperienced  by  another  financial  institution,  even  if  we  do  not  experience  a  related  loss,  could  result  in  a  material  change  in  the  output  of  ouradvanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. Anoperational  loss  that  we  experience  could  also  result  in  a  material  change  in  our  capital  requirements  for  operational  risk  under  the  advancedapproaches,  depending on the severity  of the loss event,  its  characterization  among the seven Basel-defined  units  of measure  (UOM),  and thestability  of  the  distributional  approach  for  a  particular  UOM,  and  without  direct  correlation  to  the  effects  of  the  loss  event,  or  the  timing  of  sucheffects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervisionor interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capitalratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could bematerial as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject tofurther evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
The  SLR  rule  requires  that,  as  of  January  1,  2018,  (i)  State
Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well capitalized
under  the  U.S.  banking  regulators’  Prompt  Corrective  Action
Framework  and  (ii)  we  maintain  an  SLR  of  at  least  5.0%  to  avoid
limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In  addition  to  the  SLR,  State  Street  Bank  is  subject  to  a  well
capitalized tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.
Effective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S.
federal  banking  agencies  adopted  a  final  rule  as  part  of  the
EGRRCPA  that  establishes  a  deduction  for  qualifying  central  bank
deposits  from  a  custodial  banking  organization’s  total  leverage
exposure  equal  to  the  lesser  of  (i)  the  total  amount  of  funds  the
custodial  banking  organization  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries
have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount
of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that
are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. For the
quarter ended September 30, 2020, we have excluded $69.8 billion
of  average  balances  held  on  deposit  at  central  banks  from  the
denominator  used  in  the  calculation  of  our  SLR,  based  on  this
custodial banking deduction.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
In 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC,
LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled GSIBs,  such  as  us,  that  is  intended  to  improve  the  resiliency  and
resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations
through  enhanced  prudential  standards.  Among  other  things,  theTLAC final rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements forexternal  TLAC  and  external  LTD  effective  January  1,  2019.Specifically,  we  must  hold  (1)  combined  eligible  tier  1  regulatorycapital and LTD in the amount equal to the greater of 21.5% of totalRWA (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a G-SIB surcharge calculatedfor  these  purposes  under  Method  1  of  1.0%  plus  any  applicablecounter-  cyclical  buffer,  which  is  currently  0%)  and  9.5%  of  totalleverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the SLR buffer of 2.0%), asdefined by the SLR final rule; and (2) qualifying external LTD equalto  the  greater  of  7.0%  of  RWA  (6.0%  minimum  plus  a  G-SIBsurcharge  calculated  for  these  purposes  under  method  2  of  1.0%)and  4.5%  of  total  leverage  exposure,  as  defined  by  the  SLR  finalrule. As of April 1, 2020, the TLAC and LTD requirements calibratedto  SLR  reflect  the  deduction  of  certain  central  bank  balances  asprescribed  by  the  regulatory  relief  implemented  under  theEGRRCPA.
The  following  table  presents  our  external  LTD  and  externalTLAC as of September 30, 2020.

This proposal would alsomake  conforming  modifications  to  our  TLAC  and  eligible  LTDrequirements applicable to G-SIBs. At this point in time, it is unclearwhether this proposal will be implemented as proposed.In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federalbanking agencies issued a final rule to implement the StandardizedApproach for counterparty credit risk as a replacement of the CurrentExposure  Method  for  calculating  exposure-at-default  of  derivativesexposures. Mandatory compliance with the final rule is required byJanuary 1, 2022.
On March 4, 2020, the Agencies issued the SCB final rule thatwill  replace,  under  the  Standardized  Approach,  the  current  capitalconservation buffer (2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the differenceState Street Corporation | 46
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSbetween  the  institution’s  starting  and  lowest  projected  CET1  ratio
under  the  CCAR  severely  adverse  scenario  plus  planned  common
stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth
through  seventh  quarter  of  the  CCAR  planning  horizon.  The  SCB
requirement,  which  became  effective  October  1,  2020,  can  be  no
less than 2.5% of RWA.
The  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  Agencies  issued  interimfinal rules effective in March 2020 and later finalized on a permanent
basis  on  August  26,  2020,  which  revised  the  definition  of  eligible
retained  income  for  all  U.S.  banking  organizations.  The  revised
definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic limitations
on  capital  distributions,  where  a  banking  organization's  regulatory
ratios were to decline below the respective minimum requirements,
take effect on a more gradual basis.
Following  the  launch  of  the  MMLF  program,  which  we
participate  in,  the  Federal  Reserve  issued  an  interim  final  rule  on
March  19,  2020  (followed  by  a  final  rule  on  September  29,  2020),
allowing  Bank  Holding  Companies  (BHCs)  to  exclude  assets
purchased  with  the  MMLF  program  from  their  RWA,  total  leverage
exposure  and  average  total  consolidated  assets.  For  the  quarter
ended  September  30,  2020,  we  deducted  $7.5  billion  of  MMLF
program average HTM securities.
On  March  27,  2020,  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking
Supervision (BCBS) announced the deferral of the implementation of
the  revisions  to  the  Basel  III  framework  to  January  1,  2023.  As  of
now,  the  U.S.  Agencies  have  not  formally  proposed  the
implementation of the BCBS revisions.
Effective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S.
Agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes
a  deduction  for  qualifying  central  bank  deposits  from  a  custodial
banking organization’s total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of
(i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and
its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  on  deposit  at  qualifying  central
banks  and  (ii)  the  total  amount  of  client  funds  on  deposit  at  the
custodial  banking  organization  that  are  linked  to  fiduciary  or
custodial  and  safekeeping  accounts.  For  the  quarter  ended
September  30,  2020,  we  were  permitted  to  deduct  $69.8  billion  of
average  balances  held  on  deposit  at  central  banks  from  the
denominator  used  in  the  calculation  of  our  SLR,  based  on  this
custodial banking deduction.
In  addition  to  the  regulatory  relief  granted  to  custodial  banks
under the EGRRCPA, an SLR interim final rule released on April 1,
2020  allows  all  BHCs  to  deduct  their  deposits  at  Federal  Reserve
Banks  and  their  investments  in  U.S.  Treasuries  from  their  total
leverage exposure on a temporary basis, from the second quarter of
2020 through the first quarter of
2021. The temporary deduction of our investment in U.S. Treasuriesis  incremental  to  the  existing  central  bank  placement  deductiongranted to custodian banks under EGRRCPA. For the quarter endedSeptember  30,  2020,  we  were  permitted  to  deduct  $14.1  billioninvested in U.S. Treasuries from our total leverage exposure.On May 15, 2020, the U.S. Agencies released an interim finalrule that permits insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCsalso  to  elect  to  temporarily  exclude  deposits  at  Federal  ReserveBanks and investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverageexposure,  subject  to  certain  conditions.  State  Street  Bank  haselected not to apply such exclusions as of September 30, 2020.On June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve ofthe  results  from  this  year's  DFAST  stress  test,  including  ourpreliminary  SCB  of  2.5%.  Additionally,  included  in  this  notificationand in light of the considerable economic uncertainty created by theCOVID-19  pandemic,  all  participating  CCAR  banking  organizationswill be required to resubmit their capital plans by November 2, 2020,based  on  updated  scenarios  provided  by  the  Federal  Reserve  onSeptember 17, 2020.
In  line  with  the  decision  to  administer  a  new  stress  test,  theFederal  Reserve  is  limiting  the  ability  of  all  CCAR  bankingorganizations  to  make  capital  distributions  in  the  third  and  fourthquarters  of  2020,  although  banking  organizations  are  permitted  topay common stock dividends at previous levels and is further limitedby  a  formula  based  on  recent  income.  As  a  result,  CCAR  bankingorganizations,  including  us,  were  not  permitted  to  return  capital  toshareholders in the form of common share repurchases during thethird  quarter  of  2020,  and  will  not  be  permitted  to  return  capital  toshareholders in the form of common share repurchases in the fourthquarter of 2020, unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve.As of now, our capital  distributions  in the first  quarter  of 2021 andbeyond  will  be  governed  by  our  minimum  capital  requirementsinclusive of the SCB.
On  August  10,  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  confirmed  that  ourSCB  will  be  2.5%  for  the  period  starting  on  October  1,  2020  andending on September 30, 2021, resulting in no change to our capitalrequirements. Results from the new stress test are expected by theend of the year, however, it is unclear whether or not the results willimpact our calculated SCB.

In  June  2019,  the  Federal  Reserve  issued  a  non-objection  to  our  capital  plan  submitted  as  part  of  the  CCAR  2019  submission;  and  inconnection  with  that  capital  plan,  our  Board  approved  a  common  stock  purchase  program  authorizing  the  purchase  of  up  to  $2.0  billion  of  ourcommon stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspendedcommon share repurchases to bolster capital in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve imposed limitationson capital distributions for all large banks, including the suspension of common share repurchases through the third quarter of 2020. As a result, wehad no repurchases of our common stock in either the second or third quarters of 2020 under our common stock purchase program. On September30, 2020, the Federal Reserve extended the suspension of common share repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020.
In June 2018, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of our common stockthrough June 30, 2019 (the 2018 Program). We repurchased $300 million of our common stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2019under the 2018 Program.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program,
we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In
most  circumstances,  we  indemnify  our  clients  for  the  fair  market
value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return
such  securities.  Though  these  transactions  are  collateralized,  the
substantial  volume  of  these  activities  necessitates  detailed  creditbased  underwriting  and  monitoring  processes.  The  aggregate
amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $379.05 billion and
$367.90 billion as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
respectively.  We  require  the  borrower  to  provide  collateral  in  an
amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities
borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these
securities  lending  services  as  agent,  and  the  collateral  is  not
recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. We revalue the
securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional
collateral  is  necessary  or  if  excess  collateral  is  required  to  be
returned  to  the  borrower.  We  held,  as  agent,  cash  and  securities
totaling  $398.08  billion  and  $385.43  billion  as  collateral  for
indemnified  securities  on  loan  as  of  September  30,  2020  and
December 31, 2019, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of
our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in thirdparty  repurchase  agreements,  for  which  we  indemnify  the  client
against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to
the  indemnified  repurchase  agreement  to  provide  collateral  in  an
amount  in  excess  of  100%  of  the  amount  of  the  repurchase
agreement.  In  our  role  as  agent,  the  indemnified  repurchase
agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in
our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $398.08
billion  and  $385.43  billion,  referenced  above,  $49.50  billion  and
$45.66  billion  was  invested  in  indemnified  repurchase  agreements
as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We
or our agents held $53.05 billion and $48.89 billion as collateral for
indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of September
30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESOur  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  inconformity  with  U.S.  GAAP,  and  we  apply  accounting  policies  thataffect  the  determination  of  amounts  reported  in  the  consolidatedfinancial statements.
Certain  of  our  accounting  policies,  by  their  nature,  requiremanagement to make judgments, involving significant estimates andassumptions,  about  the  effects  of  matters  that  are  inherentlyuncertain.  These  estimates  and  assumptions  are  based  oninformation  available  as  of  the  date  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements,  and  changes  in  this  information  over  time  couldmaterially  affect  the  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  equity,  revenueand  expenses  reported  in  subsequent  consolidated  financialstatements.
Based  on  the  sensitivity  of  reported  financial  statementamounts  to  the  underlying  estimates  and  assumptions,  the  moresignificant accounting policies applied by us have been identified bymanagement  as  those  associated  with  recurring  fair  valuemeasurements, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets,contingencies  and  allowance  for  credit  losses.  These  accountingpolicies  require  the  most  subjective  or  complex  judgments,  andunderlying  estimates  and  assumptions  could  be  most  subject  torevision as new information becomes available. An understanding ofthe  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  underlying  theseaccounting policies is essential in order to understand our reportedconsolidated results of operations and financial condition.Allowance for Credit LossesIn  January  2020,  we  adopted  ASC  326,which  replaces  theincurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology. Wemaintain  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  to  support  our  on-balancesheet credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortizedcost and investment securities held to-maturity. We also maintain anallowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to supportour  off-balance  credit  exposure.  The  two  components  togetherrepresent the allowance for credit losses.
Determining  the  appropriateness  of  the  allowance  is  complexand requires judgment by management about the effect of mattersthat are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecaststhen prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance forcredit losses in those future periods. We estimate credit losses overthe  contractual  life  of  the  financial  asset  while  factoring  inprepayment  activity  where  supported  by  data  over  a  three  yearreasonable  and  supportable  forecast  period.  We  utilize  a  baseline,upside  and  downside  scenario  which  are  applied  based  on  aprobability

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSweighting,  in  order  to  better  reflect  management’s  expectation  of
expected  credit  losses  given  existing  market  conditions  and  the
changes  in  the  economic  environment.  The  multiple  scenarios  are
based  on  a  three  year  horizon  (or  less  depending  on  contractual
maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year
historical  average  thereafter.  The  contractual  term  excludes
expected  extensions,  renewals  and  modifications,  but  includes
prepayment assumptions where applicable.
