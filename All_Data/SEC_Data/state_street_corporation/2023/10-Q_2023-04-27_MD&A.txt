MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation is one of the world’s largest providers of financial
services to institutional investors. Our clients - asset managers and owners,
insurance companies, official institutions, and central banks - rely on us to deliver
solutions that support their goals across the investment life cycle.
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial
strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal
banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State
Street Bank, we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including
in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We provide a
broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide,
with $37.64 trillion of AUC/A and $3.62 trillion of AUM as of March 31, 2023.
As of March 31, 2023, we had consolidated total assets of $290.82 billion,
consolidated total deposits of $223.63 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $24.75 billion and approximately 43,000 employees.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Our executive offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02111 (telephone (617) 786-3000). Effective in May 2023, our
executive offices will be located at One Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts
02114. For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
March 31, 2023 (Form 10-Q), unless the context requires otherwise, references to
"State Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of this Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2022 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 previously filed with the SEC
(2022 Form 10-K). The financial information
contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the financial and other information
contained in our 2022 Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in
this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of
certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex, about matters
that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
• Recurring fair value measurements;
• Allowance for credit losses;
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• Contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex
judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision
as new information becomes available. For additional information about these
significant accounting policies refer to pages 120 to 122, “Significant Accounting
Estimates” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form 10-K. We did not
change these significant accounting policies in the first three months of 2023.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, is presented using both a U.S. GAAP, or
reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used
in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain
financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management
uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to,
financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP
financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently
applicable regulatory

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. As part of our non-GAAP-basis measures, we
present a fully taxable-equivalent NII that reports non-taxable revenue, such as
interest income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxableequivalent basis, which we believe facilitates an investor's understanding and
analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory
standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with
respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading
activities) and the LCR, summary results of semi-annual State Street-run stress
tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan disclosures
required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional disclosures are accessible on
the "Filings & Reports" tab under the “Investors” section of our corporate website at
www.investors.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual
reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and
abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us
under the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other
public statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in
our Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as
applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
U.S. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations
regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations,
strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio
performance, ESG, human capital, climate, dividend and stock purchase programs,
acquisitions, outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, joint ventures and
divestitures, client growth and new technologies, services, asset installations and
opportunities, as well as industry, governmental, regulatory, economic and market
trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters
that do not relate strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,” "outcome,"
“forecast,” "future," “outlook,” “believe,” “priority,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,”
“may,” “will,” “trend,” “target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or
variations of such terms, are intended to identify forward-looking statements,
although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
which change over time, are based on management's expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future
results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of
the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of
factors affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the
equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to
State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could
cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking
statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not
limited to:
Strategic Risks
• We are subject to intense competition, which could negatively affect our
profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability in our financial
results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and services, including
State Street Alpha or State Street Digital , and the enhancement of our
infrastructure required to meet increased regulatory and client expectations
for resiliency and the systems and process re-engineering necessary to
achieve improved productivity and reduced operating risk, involve costs,
risks and dependencies on third parties;
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and
maintain our technology infrastructure or as a result of a cyber-attack or
similar vulnerability in our or business partners' infrastructure;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and the
integration, retention and development of the benefits of our acquisitions,
pose risks for our business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support
our business.
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by geopolitical, economic and market
conditions, including, for example, as a result of liquidity or capital
deficiencies (actual or perceived)
SM SM

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
by other financial institutions and related market and government actions,
the ongoing war in Ukraine, actions taken by central banks to address
inflationary pressures, challenging conditions in global equity markets,
periods of significant volatility in valuations and liquidity or other disruptions
in the markets for equity, fixed income and other asset classes globally or
within specific markets such as those that impacted the UK gilts in the
fourth quarter of 2022;
• We have significant international operations and clients that can be
adversely impacted by developments in European and Asian economies;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and
consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes
in the financial markets, governmental action or monetary policy. For
example, among other risks, increases in prevailing interest rates could lead
to reduced levels of client deposits and resulting decreases in our NII;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk of counterparties, who may also have
substantial financial dependencies on other financial institutions, and these
credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our revenue and is
subject to decline based on, among other factors, market and currency
declines, investment activities and preferences of our clients and their
business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, our financial
condition, capital ratios, results of operations and business prospects could
be adversely affected;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not
be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an actual or
perceived reduction in our financial strength, our borrowing and capital
costs, liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common share
repurchases, may
be adversely affected by regulatory capital, credit (counterparty and
otherwise) and liquidity standards and considerations;
• We face extensive and changing governmental regulation in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and
compliance risks and may affect our business activities and strategies;
• We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of the resolution
of prior regulatory or governmental matters;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and
litigation;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased political and
regulatory scrutiny of asset management stewardship and corporate ESG
practices;
• Our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and
may result in the identification of additional billing errors;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have
an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory
actions, litigation and other adverse effects;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios depend on
data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are
subject to change, which could materially impact our risk exposures, our
total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated
results of operations and financial condition;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions
and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our
effective tax rate;
• We could face liabilities for withholding and other non-income taxes,
including in connection with our services to clients, as a result of tax
authority examinations; and
• The transition away from LIBOR may result in additional costs and
increased risk exposure.
Operational Risks
• Our internal control environment may be inadequate, fail or be
circumvented, and operational risks could adversely affect our business and
consolidated results of operations;
• Shifting operational activities to non-U.S. jurisdictions, changing our
operating model
State Street Corporation | 6
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
and outsourcing portions of our operations to third parties may expose us to
increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and reputational harm and may
not result in expected cost savings or operational improvements;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information
technology systems or facilities, or disruptions to our or their operations,
could result in significant costs, reputational damage and impacts on our
business activities;
• Long-term contracts and customizing service delivery for clients expose us
to pricing and performance risk;
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other
reputational harm;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or may infringe upon
the rights of third parties;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors
that could adversely impact our business and regulatory compliance;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur
substantial losses or are restricted in redeeming their interests in
investment pools that we sponsor or manage;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses to such risks,
could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including terrorist
attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a new pandemic or acts of
embezzlement.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our
forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the
factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our
other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be
relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no
obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made.
The factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all
risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all
developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions and should
not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in
State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings,
including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our
annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act
of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
results for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, is
provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line of Business Information"
and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as in our consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q. In this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where
we describe the effects of changes in foreign currency translation, those effects are
determined by applying applicable weighted average FX rates from the relevant
2022 period to the relevant 2023 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• First quarter of 2023 financial performance:
◦ Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, in the first quarter of 2023,
decreased 3% as compared to the same period of 2022.
◦ Total revenue increased 1% in the first quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, as higher NII was partially offset by
lower fee revenue. Currency translation decreased total revenue by
1% in the first quarter of 2023, relative to the same period of 2022.
◦ Total expenses increased 2% in the first quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting continued business
investments and higher salaries, partially offset by ongoing
productivity savings, lower seasonal expenses and the benefit from
currency translation. Currency translation reduced expenses by 2%
in the first quarter of 2023 relative to the same period of 2022.
◦ In the first quarter of 2023, return on equity was 9.3%, a decrease
from 9.5% in the same period of 2022, primarily due to a decrease
in net income available to common shareholders, partially offset by
lower average common shareholders' equity. Pre-tax margin of
22.2% in the first quarter of 2023, decreased from 24.5% in same
period of 2022, primarily due to higher expenses and provisions for
credit losses.
◦ Operating leverage was negative 1.2% points in the first quarter of
2023. Operating leverage represents the difference between the
percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in
total
expenses, in each case relative to the same period in the prior year.
◦ Fee operating leverage was negative 11.0% points in the first
quarter of 2023. Fee operating leverage represents the difference
between the percentage change in total fee revenue and the
percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the
same period in the prior year.
◦ Returned approximately $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the form
of common stock dividends and common share repurchases.
◦ Announced our agreement to acquire CF Global Trading to add
scale to our outsourced trading services and further broaden the
Alpha platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the
end of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.
Revenue
• Total fee revenue decreased 9% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to
the same period of 2022, reflecting the impact of lower average market
levels on servicing fees and management fees, lower FX trading services,
and lower software and processing fees, partially offset by higher securities
finance and other fee revenue.
• Servicing fee revenue decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower average equity and
fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and normal
pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business.
• Management fee revenue decreased 12% in the first quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to lower average equity
and fixed income market levels and a previously reported client-specific
pricing adjustment.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue decreased 5% in the first
quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting
the absence of unusually high client FX volumes in the first quarter of 2022,
partially offset by higher FX spreads.
• Securities finance revenue increased 14% in the first quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily from higher specials
activity, partially offset by lower balances.
State Street Corporation | 8
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• Software and processing fees revenue decreased 18% in the first quarter of
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower front
office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
• Other fee revenue increased $16 million in the first quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to positive marketrelated adjustments.
• NII increased 50% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period
of 2022, primarily due to higher short-term market rates from global central
bank rate hikes, an increase in long-term interest rates and balance sheet
positioning, partially offset by lower average client deposits.
Provision for Credit Losses
• In the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a $44 million provision for credit
losses, driven by an episodic provision of $29 million associated with
industry support for a U.S. financial institution, as well as an increase in
loan loss reserves driven by credit portfolio rating changes.
Expenses
• Total expenses increased 2% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the
same period of 2022, primarily reflecting continued business investments
and higher salaries, partially offset by ongoing productivity savings, lower
seasonal expenses and the benefit from currency translation. Currency
translation reduced expenses by 2% in the first quarter of 2023 relative to
the same period of 2022.
Notable items
• There were no notable items in the first quarter of 2023.
• Notable items in the first quarter of 2022 was comprised of acquisition and
restructuring costs of approximately $9 million related to the BBH Investor
Services acquisition transaction that we are no longer pursuing.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $37.6 trillion as of March 31, 2023, decreased 10% compared to
March 31, 2022, primarily due to lower quarter-end market levels and a
previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by new business
installations. In the first quarter of 2023, newly announced asset servicing
mandates totaled approximately $112 billion, about half of which were
alternatives mandates that generally carry higher fee rates than traditional
asset classes. Servicing
assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $3.6
trillion as of March 31, 2023.
• AUM of $3.6 trillion as of March 31, 2023, decreased 10% compared to
March 31, 2022, primarily due to lower quarter-end market levels and net
outflows from institutional.
Capital
• In the first quarter of 2023, we returned a total of approximately $1.5 billion
of capital to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and
common share repurchases.
◦ We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.63 per
share, totaling $212 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to
$0.57 per share, totaling $209 million in the same period of 2022,
representing an increase of approximately 10% on a per share
basis.
◦ In the first quarter of 2023, we acquired 13.6 million shares of
common stock at an average per share cost of $91.57 and an
aggregate cost of approximately $1.25 billion. These purchases
were all conducted under the share repurchase program approved
by our Board of Directors in January 2023, authorizing the purchase
of up to $4.5 billion of our common stock through December 31,
2023.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 12.1% as of March 31,
2023, compared to 13.6% as of December 31, 2022, primarily driven by the
continuation of our common share repurchase program and expected
normalization of RWA. As we continue to deploy capital to our businesses,
we may see modest RWA growth over the coming quarters, subject to
market volatility. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.0% as of March 31, 2023,
was relatively flat compared to December 31, 2022. Given the current
global economic environment, and our plans for share repurchases, we
currently expect our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios to move into
our target ranges of 10-11% and 5.25-5.75%, respectively, in the second
half of the year.

Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the first
quarter of 2023 and 2022. Servicing and management fees collectively made up
approximately 72% and 73% of the total fee revenue in the first quarter of 2023 and
2022, respectively.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased 11% in the
first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower
average equity and fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and
normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Currency translation
decreased servicing fee revenue by 1% in the first quarter of 2023 relative to the
same period of 2022.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 46% and 47%
of total servicing fees in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle
office services. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several
factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net
new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range
of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and
administration, which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle
office services. The nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for
which the services are performed affect our servicing fees. The basis for fees will
differ across regions and clients.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic
and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a
corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though
the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography
of assets held within our clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the
valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our
valuation is dependent on third party information, AUC/A is reported on a time lag,
typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our
reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end market levels.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately
2% on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately (4)% and 8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on
our servicing fees, which historically was included within client activity and asset flows, is now reflected within change in market valuations. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End
Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to
individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices
presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31, 2023 that a 10%
increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a
corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain
constant and using relevant information as of March 31, 2023, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less
volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time. In periods of higher fixed income market
volatility such as we have been experiencing since the second quarter of 2022, the impact of fixed income markets on our servicing fee revenues may increase.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire
transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors,
including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five years
ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately 0% on average with a range of (2)% to
1% annually and approximately 0% and (1)% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As noted under "Changes in Market Valuations" in this section, this analysis now excludes, but in prior
reporting previously included, the impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ
from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

The first quarter of 2023 data for Europe is on a rolling three month basis for December 2022 through February 2023, sourced by Morningstar.
Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on
average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 1% in both 2022 and 2021.
Gross investment servicing mandates were $112 billion in the first quarter of 2023 and $2.00 trillion per year on average over the past five years. Over the five years ended
December 31, 2022, gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from approximately $0.79 trillion to $3.52 trillion.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of
assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from
6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. We expect that our more complex installations, including new State
Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $3.65 trillion that are yet to be installed as of
March 31, 2023, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 36 months.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no
assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A, once installed, can vary materially. On
average, over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (3)%
annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (4)% in any given year and approximately (2)% in both 2022 and 2021. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation
with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our
dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional
services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to
onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when
we win business from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, we estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year; although, notwithstanding
increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to

several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner in which we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and the
type of services and the other factors described in this Form 10-Q.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes
in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we
serve; and the remaining approximately 25% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of
products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee
revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.

Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
Consistent with past practice, AUC/A values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.
Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the first quarter of 2023 totaled approximately $112 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled
approximately $3.65 trillion as of March 31, 2023, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods.
The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals.
New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has
not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant,
will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing
mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us
during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping, transaction
processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as investment book of records,
transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX trading services,
liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis,
performance and attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade

compliance and ESG investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the
types of assets.
As previously disclosed, in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of
its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending necessary approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this
transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business. The transition began in 2022, but will principally occur in 2023 and 2024 and will impact our fee revenue and
income growth trends through 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the fee revenue associated with the assets yet to transition represented approximately 1.7% of our total
fee revenue. The actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range of factors, including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and
expense reductions associated with the transition.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees decreased 12% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels and a
previously reported client-specific pricing adjustment.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 25% and 27% of total management fees in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets,
such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is
more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are
dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee
revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively
managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks
associated with the applicable account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31, 2023, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won
and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would
result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a
significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.

Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Quarter-end
indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant
indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.

Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased 5% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily
reflecting the absence of unusually high client FX volumes in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by higher FX spreads. Foreign exchange trading services revenue comprises
revenue generated by FX trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 68% and 32%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services
revenue in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 69% and 31%, respectively, in the same period of 2022.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX desk through our assetservicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market
conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading
revenues often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix
tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either
direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker,
enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at
another bank.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic
FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions
through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions
generate revenue through a “click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which
are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions
charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global
trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money
market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased
14% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily
driven higher specials activity, partially offset by lower balances.
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we
refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset
owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer
to as our enhanced custody business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is
composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees
related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on
loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the
lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the
subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when
the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and
execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we
provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a
significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from
third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody
from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending
activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards,
interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending
activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2: Total Revenue,
decreased 18% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily driven by lower front office software and data revenue associated with
CRD.
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our
structured products business.
Front office software and data revenue, which primarily includes revenue from
CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, decreased 21% in the first
quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower onpremises renewals and professional services revenue.
Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily
driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS, including professional
services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and
maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of
software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when the
customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the
percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms.
The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length
of the contract as maintenance and other services are
State Street Corporation | 17
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
provided. Upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of
revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the
remaining balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS
related arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the software,
is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal
of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are
provided under the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of
CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business
units quarter to quarter.
Lending related and other fees decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2023
compared to the same period of 2022, reflecting lower unfunded commitments
relating to our municipal and fund finance products, driven by changes in product
mix. Lending related and other fees primarily consists of fee revenue associated
with our fund finance, leverage loans, municipal finance, insurance and stable value
wrap businesses.
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated
with certain tax-advantaged investments and other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue increased 55% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the
same period of 2022, primarily due to positive market-related adjustments.
Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line of Business
Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest
expense for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less
interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets,
which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with
banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by
client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total
interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average
interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned
from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to an
FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.
NII increased 50% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of
2022, primarily due to higher short-term market rates from global central bank rate
hikes, an increase in long-term interest rates and balance sheet positioning, partially
offset by lower average client deposits.
Investment securities net purchase premium amortization, which is included in
interest income, was $14 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $87 million
in the same period of 2022. The decrease in MBS premium amortization is primarily
due to lower prepayments from higher long-end interest rates.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated
statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the
security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as
purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for
prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities premium amortization
net of discount accretion for the periods indicated:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Average total interest-earning assets were $237.53 billion in the first quarter of
2023 compared to $258.11 billion in the same period of 2022. The decrease is
primarily due to lower client deposit balances.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $77.22 billion in the first quarter
of 2023 compared to $76.74 billion in the same period of 2022. These deposits
primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the ECB
and other non-U.S. central banks. The lower levels of average cash balances reflect
lower levels of client deposits.
Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $1.64 billion in the
first quarter of 2023 compared to $3.15 billion in the same period of 2022. As a
member of FICC, we may net securities sold under repurchase agreements against
those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also
members of the clearing organization, when specific netting criteria are met. The
impact of balance sheet netting was $116.65 billion on average in the first quarter of
2023 compared to $55.02 billion in the same period of 2022, primarily driven by an
increase in FICC repo volumes.
We are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a sponsoring member
within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities
with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC
Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We
may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC,
backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance
of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. We generally obtain a
security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral
that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may be required to pay a pro rata share
of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event
of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting member’s clearing
fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation to FICC is depleted. It is difficult to
estimate our maximum possible exposure under the membership agreement, since
this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against us that
have not yet occurred. We did not record any liabilities under these arrangements
as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Average investment securities decreased to $107.09 billion in the first quarter
of 2023 from $119.29 billion in the same period of 2022. The portfolio declined
across all major asset classes,
which was primarily driven by a smaller balance sheet from lower client deposits
amidst a higher level of market rates.
Average loans decreased to $33.52 billion in the first quarter of 2023
compared to $34.41 billion in the same period of 2022, due to lower overdrafts.
Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts, averaged $29.21 billion in the first
quarter of 2023 compared to $28.83 billion in the same period of 2022. Additional
information about these loans is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced
custody business, decreased to $17.39 billion in the first quarter of 2023 from
$23.77 billion in the same period of 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in the level
of cash collateral posted. Other interest-earning assets primarily reflects enhanced
custody assets where cash has been posted to borrow securities from lenders,
which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. This cash includes both cash
from borrowers and cash utilized from our balance sheet, and is presented on a net
basis on the balance sheet where we have enforceable netting agreements. Noninterest earning assets also includes a portion of our enhanced custody assets
where borrower-provided non-cash collateral has been utilized to borrow securities
from lenders, which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. In addition, we
also use securities within our investment portfolio to borrow securities from lenders,
which we subsequently loan, as principal, to our borrowers; in this structure our
investment portfolio securities are encumbered, but this is not reflected on the
balance sheet. Combined with our enhanced custody liabilities, revenue from these
activities generates securities finance fee revenue as well as net interest income.
Average total interest-bearing deposits decreased to $171.62 billion in the first
quarter of 2023 from $183.63 billion in the same period of 2022. The decrease is
driven by higher market rates from central bank rate hikes, the impact of quantitative
tightening, currency translation and equity market declines. Future deposit levels will
be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior
and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates.
Average other short-term borrowings increased to $1.16 billion in the first
quarter of 2023 from $0.87 billion in the same period of 2022.
Average long-term debt was $15.87 billion in the first quarter of 2023
compared to $14.27 billion in the same period of 2022. These amounts reflect
issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
State Street Corporation | 20
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Average other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with our enhanced
custody business, were $3.08 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.88
billion in the same period of 2022. Other interest-bearing liabilities is primarily driven
by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a net basis where
we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest bearing liabilities also
include a portion of our enhanced custody liabilities where client provided non-cash
collateral has been received and we have rehypothecation rights. Securities
received as collateral from our custody clients where we have no rehypothecation
rights are used as a credit mitigant only and remain off balance sheet.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume
and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet
management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations
of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the
yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of
credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,
we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities
of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal
agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.
The pace at which we reinvest, and the types of investment securities purchased,
will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our
reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
We recorded a $44 million provision for credit losses in the first quarter of
2023, driven by an episodic provision of $29 million associated with industry support
for a U.S. financial institution, as well as an increase in loan loss reserves driven by
credit portfolio rating changes.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial Condition" in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Expenses
Table 15: Expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the first quarter of
2023 compared to the
same period of 2022. Total expenses increased 2% in the first quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting continued business
investments and higher salaries, partially offset by ongoing productivity savings,
lower seasonal expenses and the benefit from currency translation. Currency
translation reduced expenses by 2% in the first quarter of 2023 relative to the same
period of 2022.

of currency translation, which decreased compensation and employee benefits
expenses by 2% in the first quarter of 2023 relative to the same period of 2022.
Total headcount increased 9% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the
same period of 2022, primarily in global hubs driven by operational support for new
business growth segments, as well as technology investments and in-sourcing.
Information systems and communications expenses decreased 2% in the first
quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to optimization
and vendor savings initiatives, partially offset by technology infrastructure
investments.
Transaction processing services expenses decreased 9% in the first quarter of
2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to lower sub-custody
costs, driven by lower market levels and lower broker fees.
Occupancy expenses decreased 1% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to
the same period of 2022, primarily due to the impact of currency translation, which
reduced occupancy expenses by 3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the
same period of 2022.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by
the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management
lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine
balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and
short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities
are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are
denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment
alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than
our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek
to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational
in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our
assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and shortduration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing
deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual
mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our
desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate
and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall
structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global
interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality
investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our
consolidated statement of condition.
Average duration of our investment securities portfolio, including the impact of
hedges, was 2.8 years and 2.6 years as of March 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively.
Approximately 95% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated “AA” or
higher as of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as follows:

Includes $1.66 billion securities finance loans, $321 million loans to municipalities and $7 million other loans as of March 31, 2023 and $1.51 billion securities finance loans, $321 million loans to municipalities and $42 million other
loans as of December 31, 2022.
As of March 31, 2023, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $27.34 billion and fixed rate loans totaled
$2.77 billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with
EURIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for
additional details.
The increase in domestic loans was primarily driven by overdrafts, and the
increase in foreign loans was primarily driven by fund finance loans, overdrafts and
collateralized loan obligations in loan form as of March 31, 2023 compared to
December 31, 2022.
As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our leveraged loans totaled
approximately $3.39 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. We sold $283 million of
leveraged loans in the first quarter of 2023.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 of $75 million and $98 million, respectively, to participate in
syndications of leveraged loans. Additional information about these unfunded
commitments is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this

(refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q), are
externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with approximately 95% and 96% of the loans
rated “BB” or “B” as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our
investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid
credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit
analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by
counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have significant exposure
to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.

Ending balance $ 162 $ 107
The provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial and financial loans.
Consists primarily of a provision associated with industry support for a U.S. financial institution and the impact of foreign
currency translation.
The charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans.
We recorded a provision for credit losses of $44 million in the first quarter of
2023, driven by an episodic provision of $29 million associated with industry support
for a U.S. financial institution, as well as an increase in loan loss reserves driven by
credit portfolio rating changes.
As of March 31, 2023, approximately $82 million of our allowance for credit
losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial
segment compared to $61 million as of March 31, 2022. The remaining $80 million
and $46 million as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, was related
to commercial real estate loans, other loans, off-balance sheet commitments,
interest-bearing deposits with banks and other financial assets held at amortized
cost, including investment securities. As of March 31, 2023, the allowance for credit
losses represented 0.3% of total loans.
Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses is
provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of
risks, some that are inherent in the financial services industry, and others that are
more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses
on material risks, which include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risk, funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• operational resiliency risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, referred to as asset
and liability management, consisting primarily of interest rate risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of them, could
affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, and are discussed
in detail on pages 23 to 52 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2022 Form
10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 81 to
86 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading
activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal
securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement
operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central
banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Allowance for Credit Losses
We record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet
credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as
certain off-balance sheet credit exposure, including unfunded commitments and
letters of credit. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit
losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based,
among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the
estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple
economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to
develop our forecast of expected losses.
In the first quarter of 2023, the allowance estimate reflected an increase in
reserves associated with industry support for a U.S. financial institution, as well as
an increase in loan loss reserves driven by credit portfolio rating changes.
Allowance estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those inherent in our
model and economic assumptions, and management may use qualitative
adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to
determine our allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 or if credit risk
migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the
economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management framework,
including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,
risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring
and controls, refer to pages 86 to 91 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity
based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing
liquidity risk, we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning
indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This
process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios
which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential
increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the
potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well as on a standalone basis at our Parent Company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of
State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding
sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market, the Federal Reserve's
discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.
Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily
through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support
agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash and equivalents intended to meet its current
debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as those projected over the next
twelve-month period. Reference our SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of
Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial
distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be
available to the Parent Company. As of March 31, 2023, our Parent Company and
State Street Bank had approximately $1.99 billion of senior notes or subordinated
debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management
activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including
interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international
regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance,
supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some
cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII
or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the
way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative
regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a
non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our
efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics, refer to pages 91 to 96 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk
Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity
ratios, including LCR and the net stable
State Street Corporation | 28
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
funding ratio, refer to page 15 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2022 Form
10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to
improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid
securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. Net cash outflows are
measured as prescribed under the LCR rule which provides a significant benefit for
deposits classified as operational. We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily. For
the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, daily average LCR for
the Parent Company was 108% and 106%, respectively. The impact of higher
deposits on the Parent Company's LCR is limited by a cap, known as the
transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street Bank and Trust that can be
recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule. This
restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to
the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street
Bank and Trust). The average HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the Parent
Company under the LCR final rule definition was $134.65 billion for the quarter
ended March 31, 2023 compared to $139.88 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in client deposits relative to the
prior period. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, LCR for State Street Bank and
Trust was approximately 124%.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements
governing deposits with the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central
banks of approximately $73.62 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2023,
compared to $79.52 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The lower
levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of client
deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without
corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the
FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the
FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying
terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability
management. We had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB as of March 31,
2023 and had $2.0 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities
is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying
conditions. As of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had no
outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other
central bank facility.
In addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity, we have
other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as
collateral to access these various facilities. These additional assets are available
sources of liquidity and not included in our LCR asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $78.65 billion for
the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to $78.25 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2022.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of
client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to
clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan
portfolios; or other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise
under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of
our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post
collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our
enhanced custody program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $32.99 billion and $31.20 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $1.86 billion and $2.13 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of
March 31, 2023, approximately 76% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit
and 29% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our
commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross
contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit a
resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution
strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and
State Street Corporation | 29
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of major financial distress.
Through resolution planning, we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure
provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019 requires
a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the
relevant submission years. We submitted our updated 2021 targeted 165(d)
resolution plan by July 1, 2021. The targeted resolution plan included the core
elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information about the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also included was an overview of remediation
we completed to address a 2019 shortcoming on governance mechanisms related
to the timely operationalization of the support agreement. Our next 165(d) resolution
plan submission to the Agencies is due by July 1, 2023.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred resolution strategy is
the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the
Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company,
SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as
defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available
resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other
entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State
Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary
Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the
recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent
Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a
newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of
the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by
contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,
investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other
cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the
support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent
available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has
agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the
Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent
Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations
and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has
provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may
issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue
to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a
"Recapitalization Event", which is defined under the support agreement as the
earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being
breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for
the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and
SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be
exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement
that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to
fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF
is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent
Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary
Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that
identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be
made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds
are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and
liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support
that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market
confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement, (which specifically
exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential
bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to
the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and
(4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a
party to the support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or
remaining a Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the
support agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's
perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any
of our entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. We submitted our last
IDI plan before July 1, 2018. In November 2018, the FDIC had announced that until
the FDIC completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would be
required to be filed. On June 25, 2021, the FDIC issued a policy statement on
resolution plans for IDIs that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the
frequency of submissions to a three-year cycle. State Street Bank’s next IDI plan
submission deadline is December 1, 2023.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan to the Federal Reserve.
This plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be
implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress. We also
have recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we
operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody, accounting,
administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset
management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of
these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally
provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place
deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, approximately 65% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other
currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of
the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by
pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset
Liquidity,” State Street
Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms
against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold
under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature,
generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.
These balances were $3.70 billion and $1.18 billion as of March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively.
State Street Bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial
institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.04 billion, as of March 31, 2023,
to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no
stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. As of
both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was no balance outstanding on
this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business
needs. In addition, State Street Bank also has current authorization from the Board
to issue unsecured senior debt. The total amount remaining for issuance pursuant
to this authority is $1.65 billion as of March 31, 2023.
On January 26, 2023, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of
4.857% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026 and $750 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.821% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2034.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the
maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating
agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client
deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer
products;
State Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
A downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which
could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and
large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under
securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force
terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral
agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate
the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of
these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by major rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination
payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that
could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit
ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are
no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Tight labor markets, challenging conditions in the global equity and fixed
income markets, and heightened geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing war in
Ukraine, are resulting in stress on the operating environment and have increased,
and may continue to increase, operational risk. The war in Ukraine may also
heighten information technology risk exposures, including cyber-threats. See also
“Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages
97 to 100 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in
our 2022 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information
technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology noncompliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents,
business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology
operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 100 to 101 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Information Technology Risk Management" in our 2022 Form 10-K, and pages 47
to 48 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2022 Form 10-K - "Any failures of
or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology
systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations, including the
systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business, such as
resulting from cyber-attacks, could result in significant costs, reputational damage
and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities".
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or assetand-liability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is
provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk
associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate
risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of
which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity
needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against
those factors.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into
derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign
exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward
contracts and interest rate futures. As of March 31, 2023, the notional amount of
these derivative contracts was $2.45 trillion, of which $2.42 trillion was composed of
foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions
closely with the objective of mitigating related

currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at
current market rates.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities, refer to pages 101 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Market
Risk Management" in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,
which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical
confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR,
and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk
requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a
one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to
calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of
continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The
stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in
the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR
meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that
is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial
stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking
the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from
within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial
crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011.
As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time,
future market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and
methodologies, refer to pages 103 to 108 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Valueat-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates
techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a
hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also
monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component,
and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected
historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the
potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and
we also perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process.
Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk,
division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and
volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Credit and Market Risk
Committee (CMRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in
conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the
CMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that
prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based
model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves
the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss
(P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR
model using “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees,
commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the
price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees,
commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
We had zero back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended March 31, 2023. We
had one back-testing exception in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and one
back-testing exception in the quarter ended March 31, 2022. At a 99% confidence
interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception
every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).

The three month average of our total stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $35 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to an average of
approximately $32 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and $36 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The slight increase in the average total stressed VaR for
the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2022, is primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our
trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction
in VaR measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,
and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate
risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and
liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic
value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits
generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio
positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our
baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 30, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts
at March 31, 2023 and 2022. Our baseline rate forecast as of March 31, 2023 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at that point
in time, which implied that rates may reach peak levels in the second quarter of 2023 and rate cuts may begin towards the end of 2023.

European Central Bank deposit facility rate.
In Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve
relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of
changes in interest rates on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions
change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance rotation,
including reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest
rates.

Our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an NII benefit in higher rate scenarios. Our USD balance sheet has become liability
sensitive driven by higher deposit betas resulting in an NII exposure to higher rate scenarios.
As of March 31, 2023, USD NII benefits in lower rate scenarios and is exposed to higher rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve. Compared
to March 31, 2022, our short-end USD NII has become exposed to higher interest rates due to the higher level of baseline market interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s
quantitative tightening program resulting in higher deposit betas and deposit balance rotation and reductions. Long-end USD sensitivities have decreased since March 31, 2022 as
the implementation of investment portfolio risk reduction strategies lowered our forecasted long-end reinvestment.
As of March 31, 2023, non-USD NII benefits in higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve.
Compared to March 31, 2022, our short-end non-USD sensitivity to higher rates decreased due to deposit balance rotation and reduction. Our short-end non-USD sensitivity to lower
rates remained largely unchanged from prior year.
USD and non-USD NII sensitivities are also impacted by routine currency-level baseline forecasting updates and refinements.
NII sensitivity is routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to Management’s

Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry,
with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support
numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models
contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial
management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model
results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect
on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework
seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management framework,
including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 109 to 110 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or
capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of
strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic
risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market
performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary
impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit,
operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our
assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.
Management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our
business.
Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational
and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of
an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an
operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the
potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as
a strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a
major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired
business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue,
would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
Strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for its
assessment and management include the development of business plans, which
are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the Board of
Directors, as well as a
formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals.
The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify
with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility,
scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the
potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and control of
strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight
from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk
management processes.
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial
flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own
internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by
banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge
above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all
other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to
the required minimum of 3.0% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any
regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and
discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or
financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be
subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 110 to 117 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market
risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators.
The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital
adequacy: the “standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches", applicable
to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach
prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk
weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches
consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of
RWA related to credit risk, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the
calculation of RWA related to operational risk.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, we and State Street Bank, as advanced
approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to
as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy,
such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the
lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized
approach. Under the advanced approaches, State Street and State Street Bank are
subject to a 2.5% CCB requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital
buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. Under the standardized approach,
State Street Bank is subject to the same CCB and countercyclical capital buffer
requirements, but for State Street, the 2.5% CCB requirement is replaced by the
SCB requirement according to the SCB rule issued in 2020. In addition, State Street
is subject to a G-SIB surcharge.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB with a buffer
calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected
CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock
dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh
quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than
2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a
banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments to executive officers. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at
zero by U.S. banking regulators.
On June 23, 2022, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from
the 2022 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under this supervisory stress
test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which was
effective starting October 1, 2022 and will run through September 30, 2023.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2023, include a CCB of
2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach,
respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This
results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2023, is 1.0%. Based on
a calculation date of December 31, 2022, our G-SIB surcharge will be 1.0% through
December 31, 2024.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company,
we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other
requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily
measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading
positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR
measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public
disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market
risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR
measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is
provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
On September 7, 2022, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision stated
that the Federal Reserve was undertaking a holistic review of U.S. capital
requirements that will help the regulator consider adjustments, if any, to the current
framework. In addition, on September 9, 2022, the U.S. Banking Agencies
reaffirmed their commitment to implementing revised regulatory capital
requirements that align with the final set of Basel III standards (Basel IV package)
issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2017. They
intend to seek public comments on a joint proposed rule in the coming months.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 110 to 117 included

Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include AOCI hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit riskbased deductions.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial
condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory
review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 23, 2022, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2022
supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2022 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which is in effect from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our CET1 capital decreased $0.52 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to common stock dividends and share repurchases in the first
quarter of 2023, partially offset by net income and a decrease in unrealized losses on AFS securities within AOCI. Our Tier 1 capital decreased $0.52 billion as of March 31, 2023,
compared to December 31, 2022, under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach, primarily due to the decrease in CET1 capital.
Our Tier 2 capital remained flat as of March 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach.
Our total capital decreased by $0.53 billion and $0.48 billion as of March 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under the advanced approaches and standardized
approach, respectively, primarily due to the decrease in CET1 capital.

 Not applicable
As of March 31, 2023, total advanced approaches RWA increased $2.94 billion compared to December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in credit risk RWA. The increase in
credit risk RWA primarily reflects higher repo-style transactions, driven by increased volume and higher equity markets, and higher all other RWA, related to higher cash and
deposits, which was partially offset by a decrease in investment securities RWA, related to agency securities.
As of March 31, 2023, total standardized approach RWA increased $8.36 billion compared to December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in credit risk RWA. The increase in
credit risk RWA primarily reflects higher repo-style transactions, driven by increased volume and higher equity markets, and higher loans RWA, related to new capital call
commitments.
The regulatory capital ratios as of March 31, 2023, presented in Table 32: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the
advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with
respect to our capital and related matters as of March 31, 2023, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions,
collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual
report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually
or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events
experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing
regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a
material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.
An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the
severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation
to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us
or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will
change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III
final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The Tier 1
leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance
sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the
denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet
assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio
requirement of 5.0%.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company
requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, is intended to improve the
resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced
prudential standards, and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 56 to 58 in "Related
Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and pages 165 to 167
in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof,
are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market purchases, accelerated share
repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction
may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our
financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock
issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our
clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of
these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $349.97 billion and
$348.92 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of
the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement
of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the
borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $364.02 billion and $366.90 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of March 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we
indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100%
of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. Of the collateral of $364.02 billion and $366.90 billion, referenced above, $56.57 billion and $54.11 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements
as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We or our agents held $60.94 billion and $57.90 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase
agreements as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q.
OTHER MATTERS
Closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and Related FDIC Matters
On March 12 and 13, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) and Signature Bank and the appointment of the FDIC as the receiver for those banks, the FDIC
announced that, under the systemic risk exception set forth in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), all insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the
respective bridge banks for SVB and Signature Bank.
The FDIC also announced that, as required by the FDIA, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a special
assessment. Under the FDIA, the assessment may be on insured depository institutions, depository institution holding companies (with the concurrence of the Treasury

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Secretary), or both, as the FDIC determines to be appropriate. In its semiannual update on the Restoration Plan for the DIF, released on April 18, 2023, the FDIC estimated the
losses to the DIF of resolving SVB and Signature Bank to be $22.5 billion in the aggregate, of which $19.2 billion was attributable to the cost of covering uninsured deposits pursuant
to the systemic risk exception. The FDIA provides that the special assessment will be prescribed through regulation, and the FDIC also noted in the same semiannual update on the
Restoration Plan that the FDIC intends to issue a proposed rulemaking for the assessment in May 2023. The FDIC has discretion with respect to the design and timeframe for any
special assessment, and, under the FDIA, the FDIC may consider the types of entities that benefit from the action taken, economic conditions, the effects on the industry, and such
other factors as the FDIC deems appropriate. The timing, amount and allocation of the special assessment that will be imposed on banking organizations, including State Street
Bank, is uncertain, but the impact of the special assessment on our expenses and results of operations may be material.
United States Federal Debt Ceiling
In January 2023, the outstanding national debt of the U.S. government reached its statutory limit. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that, since then, it has been
using extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. government’s default on its payment obligations, and to extend the time that the U.S. government has to raise its statutory debt
limit or otherwise resolve its funding situation. Further delays by Congress to raise the Federal debt ceiling could have severe repercussions within the U.S. and to global credit and
financial markets and could exacerbate concerns over the sovereign debt of other countries. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its
payment obligations, or experience delays in making payments when due, including in respect of U.S. Treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets. A payment
default or delay by the U.S. government, or continued uncertainty surrounding or other developments relating to the U.S. debt ceiling, could result in a variety of adverse effects for
financial markets and market participants, including our clients and counterparties, as well as our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates including LIBOR
On March 5, 2021, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration (IBA) announced, in conjunction with the United Kingdom FCA, that it would cease the publication
of all EUR and Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the overnight, one week, two week, two month and twelve month GBP LIBOR and Japanese yen (JPY) LIBOR settings, and the one
week and two month USD LIBOR settings, as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, the IBA announced that as of June 30, 2023, it would cease the publication of the overnight and
twelve month USD LIBOR settings and that as of June 30, 2023 the one month, three month and six month USD LIBOR settings would become non-representative.
On September 29, 2021, the FCA announced that it would compel the IBA to continue the publication of the one month, three month and six month GBP and JPY LIBOR
settings, on a synthetic, non-representative basis from year-end 2021 for a period of at least one year. On June 30, 2022, the FCA issued a consultation on winding down synthetic
tenors of GBP LIBOR and on the potential introduction of a synthetic version of certain USD LIBOR settings as of June 30, 2023. On September 29, 2022, the FCA confirmed the
cessation of all synthetic JPY LIBOR settings as of December 31, 2022, and the cessation of the one month and six month synthetic GBP LIBOR settings as of March 30, 2024. On
November 23, 2022, the FCA issued a proposal to compel publication of a synthetic version of the one month, three month and six month USD LIBOR settings until September 30,
2024. Final confirmation of the availability of synthetic USD LIBOR for the one month, three month and six month settings was issued by the FCA on March 4, 2023.
On March 15, 2022, the U.S. Congress adopted, as part of the Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act which provides certain
statutory requirements and guidance for the selection and use of alternative reference rates in legacy financial contracts governed by U.S. law that do not provide for the use of a
clearly defined or practicable alternative reference rate. On July 19, 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on a proposal to implement the LIBOR Act, as
required by its terms. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act. The final rule became effective February 27, 2023.
We have established a process to identify, assess, plan for and remediate the use of LIBOR and other reference rates affected by reference rate reform that addresses both
direct exposures on our balance sheet, and, more importantly, the use of LIBOR in our various service provider roles to our customers.
This process is led by a multidisciplinary LIBOR program management office (LIBOR PMO), established in September 2018. The LIBOR PMO will continue to drive firm-wide
results throughout 2023. The LIBOR PMO reports regularly to executive management of the firm, and our key regulators, on progress with respect to the adoption of alternative
reference rates for various financial products and services, client communications, updating
State Street Corporation | 45
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
of our quantitative models and information technology systems, managing third-party vendors, contracts remediation, evaluation of fallback provisions contained in LIBOR-priced
loans, investment securities, derivatives and long-term debt and general operational readiness for each stage of the transition.
Most of the LIBOR PMO's work for implementation of the transition to alternate reference rates is substantially complete, and contingency plans have been developed with
respect to identified uncertainties. No incremental material investments are expected to be needed for systems and processes related to the transition. Potential risks that could
impact our remediation efforts include overall transition readiness across the industry, third-party vendor dependencies and resource constraints from the concentration of
remediation activities at key points in the transition process.
Our direct on-balance sheet exposures to LIBOR are limited and primarily include assets held in the investment portfolio, certain loans made through Global Credit Finance and
issuances of long-term debt and preferred stock. We have planned for, and are prepared to transition, our remaining balance sheet exposures in a manner consistent with regulatory
guidance and the availability of interim solutions for various legacy LIBOR contracts. We will not originate or issue new LIBOR-based loans or long-term debt, and any purchases of
LIBOR-based investment securities will be screened for adequate fallback language. Our remaining exposure outstanding at the end of June 2023 is largely governed by existing
fallback language or the LIBOR Act which provides for appropriate fallback provisions. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition away from the use
of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark in financial instruments and contracts. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to market changes promptly, while
avoiding increased related expenses or operational errors.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, our management carried out an evaluation, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of March 31, 2023.
We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, no change occurred in our internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
