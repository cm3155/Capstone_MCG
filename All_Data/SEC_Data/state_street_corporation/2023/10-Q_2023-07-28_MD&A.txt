MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation is one of the world’s largest providers
of financial services to institutional investors. Our clients - asset
managers and owners, insurance companies, official institutions, and
central banks - rely on us to deliver solutions that support their goals
across the investment life cycle.
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is
a financial holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Parent Company is a source
of financial and managerial strength to our subsidiaries. Through our
subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary, State Street
Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street Bank, we
operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including in
the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
We provide a broad range of financial products and services to
institutional investors worldwide, with $39.59 trillion of AUC/A and
$3.80 trillion of AUM as of June 30, 2023.
As of June 30, 2023, we had consolidated total assets of
$294.56 billion, consolidated total deposits of $222.32 billion,
consolidated total shareholders' equity of $24.20 billion and
approximately 43,000 employees.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business,
Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are
defined based on products and services provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in
Line of Business Information in this Management's Discussion and
Analysis and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
Our executive offices are located at One Congress Street,
Boston, Massachusetts 02114 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For
purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2023 (Form 10-Q), unless the context requires
otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar
terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of this Form
10-Q and updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our
2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2022 previously filed with the SEC (2022 Form 10-K). The financial
information contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis
and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q should be
read in conjunction with the financial and other information contained
in our 2022 Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts
presented in this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to
current-period presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that
materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity,
revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or
complex, about matters that are uncertain and may change in
subsequent periods include:
• Recurring fair value measurements;
• Allowance for credit losses;
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• Contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective
or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions
could be subject to revision as new information becomes available.
For additional information about these significant accounting policies
refer to pages 120 to 122, “Significant Accounting Estimates”
included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form 10-
K. We did not change these significant accounting policies in the first
six months of 2023.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q,
including this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is presented
using both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis,
including certain non-GAAP measures used in the calculation of
identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain
financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that
management uses in evaluating our business and activities. NonGAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and
not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial information prepared
in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial information
presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s Discussion
and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently
applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. As part of
our
State Street Corporation | 4
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
non-GAAP-basis measures, we present a fully taxable-equivalent NII
that reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated
with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent
basis, which we believe facilitates an investor's understanding and
analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank
regulatory standards, including supplemental qualitative and
quantitative information with respect to regulatory capital (including
market risk associated with our trading activities) and the LCR,
summary results of semi-annual State Street-run stress tests which
we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and resolution plan
disclosures required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional
disclosures are accessible on the "Filings & Reports" tab under the
“Investors” section of our corporate website at
investors.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an
inactive textual reference only. Information on our website is not
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business
terms and abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary
following the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials
submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
registration statements filed by us under the Securities Act of 1933,
our annual report to shareholders and other public statements we
may make, may contain statements (including statements in our
Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as
applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of U.S. securities laws, including statements about our
goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital
condition, results of operations, strategies, cost savings and
transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, ESG,
human capital, climate, dividend and stock purchase programs,
acquisitions, outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, joint
ventures and divestitures, client growth and new technologies,
services, asset installations and opportunities, as well as industry,
governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives
and developments, the business environment and other matters that
do not relate strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,”
"outcome," “forecast,” "future," “outlook,” “believe,” “priority,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “trend,” “target,”
“strategy” and “goal,” or
similar statements or variations of such terms, are intended to
identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and
uncertainties, which change over time, are based on management's
expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made
and are not guarantees of future results. Management's expectations
and assumptions, and the continued validity of the forward-looking
statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of factors
affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and
the equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as
factors specific to State Street and its subsidiaries, including State
Street Bank. Factors that could cause changes in the expectations or
assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based cannot
be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not limited to:
Strategic Risks
• We are subject to intense competition, which could
negatively affect our profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability
in our financial results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and
services, including State Street Alpha or State Street
Digital , and the enhancement of our infrastructure required
to meet increased regulatory and client expectations for
resiliency and the systems and process re-engineering
necessary to achieve improved productivity and reduced
operating risk, involve costs, risks and dependencies on third
parties;
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to
update and maintain our technology infrastructure or as a
result of a cyber-attack or similar vulnerability in our or
business partners' infrastructure;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and
divestitures, and the integration, retention and development
of the benefits of our acquisitions, pose risks for our
business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is
intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the
highly skilled people we need to support our business.
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by geopolitical, economic
and market conditions, including, for example, as a result of
liquidity or capital deficiencies (actual or perceived)
SM

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
by other financial institutions and related market and
government actions, the ongoing war in Ukraine, actions
taken by central banks to address inflationary pressures,
challenging conditions in global equity markets, periods of
significant volatility in valuations and liquidity or other
disruptions in the markets for equity, fixed income and other
asset classes globally or within specific markets such as
those that impacted the UK gilts in the fourth quarter of 2022;
• We have significant international operations and clients that
can be adversely impacted by developments in European
and Asian economies, including local, regional and
geopolitical developments affecting those economies;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial
condition and consolidated results of operations could be
adversely affected by changes in the financial markets,
governmental action or monetary policy. For example, among
other risks, increases in prevailing interest rates could lead to
reduced levels of client deposits and resulting decreases in
our NII;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk of counterparties, who may
also have substantial financial dependencies on other
financial institutions, and these credit exposures and
concentrations could expose us to financial loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our
revenue and is subject to decline based on, among other
factors, market and currency declines, investment activities
and preferences of our clients and their business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and
liquidity, our financial condition, capital ratios, results of
operations and business prospects could be adversely
affected;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future,
which may not be available to us or may only be available on
unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an
actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, our
borrowing and capital costs, liquidity and reputation could be
adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common
share repurchases, may be adversely affected by regulatory
capital, credit (counterparty and otherwise) and liquidity
standards and considerations;
• We face extensive and changing governmental regulation in
the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our
costs and compliance risks and may affect our business
activities and strategies;
• We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of
the resolution of prior regulatory or governmental matters;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government
enforcement and litigation;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased
political and regulatory scrutiny of asset management
stewardship and corporate ESG practices;
• Our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are
ongoing and may result in the identification of additional
billing errors;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we
possess could have an adverse impact on our business and
could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other
adverse effects;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital
ratios depend on data inputs, formulae, models, correlations
and assumptions that are subject to change, which could
materially impact our risk exposures, our total RWA and our
capital ratios from period to period;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our
consolidated results of operations and financial condition;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our
tax positions and changes in the composition of our pre-tax
earnings may increase our effective tax rate;
• We could face liabilities for withholding and other non-income
taxes, including in connection with our services to clients, as
a result of tax authority examinations; and
• The transition away from LIBOR may result in additional
costs and increased risk exposure.
State Street Corporation | 6
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Operational Risks
• Our internal control environment may be inadequate, fail or
be circumvented, and operational risks could adversely affect
our business and consolidated results of operations;
• Shifting operational activities to non-U.S. jurisdictions,
changing our operating model and outsourcing to, or
insourcing from, third parties portions of our operations may
expose us to increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and
reputational harm and may not result in expected cost
savings or operational improvements;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our or our business
partners' information technology systems or facilities, or
disruptions to our or their operations, could result in
significant costs, reputational damage and impacts on our
business activities;
• Long-term contracts and customizing service delivery for
clients expose us to pricing and performance risk;
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse
publicity or other reputational harm;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or
may infringe upon the rights of third parties;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may
contain errors that could adversely impact our business and
regulatory compliance;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if
our clients incur substantial losses or are restricted in
redeeming their interests in investment pools that we sponsor
or manage;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses to
such risks, could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events
including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the emergence
of a new pandemic or acts of embezzlement.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is
expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical
financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and
elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our other SEC filings.
Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be relied on
as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We
undertake no obligation to revise our
forward-looking statements after the time they are made. The factors
discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all
risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot
anticipate all developments that may adversely affect our business or
operations or our consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions
and should not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate
State Street. Any investor in State Street should consider all risks and
uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our filings under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our annual reports
on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the
Securities Act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's
website at www.sec.gov or on the "Filings & Reports" tab under the
“Investors” section of our corporate website at

The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section
provides information related to significant events, as well as
highlights of our consolidated financial results for the second quarter
of 2023 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial Results. More
detailed information about our consolidated financial results,
including the comparison of our
financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023
compared to the same periods of 2022, is provided under
“Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line of Business Information"
and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as in our
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. In this
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the
effects of changes in foreign currency translation, those effects are
determined by applying applicable weighted average FX rates from
the relevant 2022 period to the relevant 2023 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Second quarter of 2023 financial performance:
◦ Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.17, in the second
quarter of 2023, increased 14% as compared to the
same period of 2022.
◦ Total revenue increased 5% in the second quarter of
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, due to
higher NII and fee revenue.
◦ Total expenses increased 5% in the second quarter
of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily reflecting higher salaries, headcount and
business investments, partially offset by ongoing
productivity savings.
◦ Return on equity was 13.0%, an increase from
12.1% in the same period of 2022, primarily due to
an increase in net income available to common
shareholders and lower average common
shareholders' equity. Pre-tax margin of 29.5% in the
second quarter of 2023, increased from 28.3% in the
same period of 2022, primarily due to an increase in
total revenue, partially offset by higher total
expenses.
◦ Operating leverage was positive 0.4% points in the
second quarter of 2023. Operating leverage
represents the difference between the percentage
change in total revenue and the percentage change
in total expenses, in each case relative to the same
period of the prior year.
◦ Fee operating leverage was negative 2.8% points in
the second quarter of 2023. Fee operating leverage
represents the difference between the percentage
change in total fee

nm

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
revenue and the percentage change in total
expenses, in each case relative to the same period
of the prior year.
◦ We returned approximately $1.3 billion to our
shareholders in the form of common stock dividends
and common share repurchases.
Revenue
• Total fee revenue increased 2% in the second quarter of
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, reflecting higher
software and processing fees, securities finance and other
fee revenue, partially offset by lower servicing fees,
management fees, and FX trading services revenue.
• Servicing fee revenue decreased 3% in the second quarter of
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven
by lower client activity and adjustments and below average
pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business.
• Management fee revenue decreased 6% in the second
quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily due to net outflows in prior periods and a shift of
certain management fees into NII associated with
management fees related to certain U.S. ETFs with unique
structures, partially offset by higher average market levels.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue decreased 8% in
the second quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of
2022, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and FX
volatility.
• Securities finance revenue increased 9% in the second
quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily due to higher agency spreads.
• Software and processing fees revenue increased 18% in the
second quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of
2022, primarily driven by higher front office software and data
revenue associated with CRD.
• Other fee revenue increased $101 million in the second
quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change
and the absence of negative market-related adjustments.
• NII increased 18% in the second quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily due to higher short-term
market rates from global central bank rate hikes, an increase
in long-term interest rates and balance sheet positioning.
This was partially
offset by lower average client deposits, which included a mix
shift from non-interest bearing towards interest-bearing.
Provision for Credit Losses
• In the second quarter of 2023, we recorded an $18 million
reserve release, driven by the release of the allowance for
credit losses related to our support of a U.S. financial
institution in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by an
increase in loan loss reserves associated with credit portfolio
rating changes.
Expenses
• Total expenses increased 5% in the second quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting
higher salaries, headcount and business investments,
partially offset by ongoing productivity savings.
Notable items
• There were no notable items in the second quarter of 2023.
• Notable items in the second quarter of 2022 comprised
acquisition and restructuring costs of approximately $12
million related to the BBH Investor Services acquisition
transaction that we are no longer pursuing.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $39.6 trillion as of June 30, 2023, increased 4%
compared to June 30, 2022, primarily due to higher quarterend equity market levels and client flows. In the second
quarter of 2023, newly announced asset servicing mandates
totaled approximately $141 billion, primarily in the asset
owners, official institutions and alternatives client segments.
We onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second
quarter of 2023. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in
future periods totaled approximately $2.4 trillion as of June
30, 2023.
• AUM of $3.8 trillion as of June 30, 2023, increased 9.3%
compared to June 30, 2022, primarily due to higher quarterend market levels.
Capital
• In the second quarter of 2023, we returned a total of
approximately $1.3 billion of capital to our shareholders in the
form of common stock dividends and common share
repurchases.
◦ We declared aggregate common stock dividends of
$0.63 per share, totaling $203 million in the second
State Street Corporation | 9
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
quarter of 2023, compared to $0.57 per share,
totaling $210 million in the same period of 2022.
◦ In July 2023, we declared third quarter common
stock dividends of $0.69 per share, representing a
10% increase on a per share basis from dividends
declared in both the third quarter of 2022 and the
second quarter of 2023.
◦ In the second quarter of 2023, we acquired 14.8
million shares of common stock at an average per
share cost of $71.08 and an aggregate cost of
approximately $1.05 billion. These purchases were
all conducted under the share repurchase program
approved by our Board of Directors in January 2023,
authorizing the purchase of up to $4.5 billion of our
common stock through December 31, 2023.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 11.8% as
of June 30, 2023, compared to 13.6% as of December 31,
2022, primarily driven by the continuation of common share
repurchases, partially offset by retained earnings. As we
continue to deploy capital to our businesses, we may see
modest RWA growth over the coming quarters, subject to
market volatility. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 5.8%
as of June 30, 2023, compared to 6.0% as of December 31,
2022, primarily driven by the continuation of common share
repurchases, partially offset by lower consolidated average
assets reflecting lower client deposits. Given the current
global economic environment, and our plans for share
repurchases, we currently expect our CET1 and Tier 1
leverage capital ratios to move into our target ranges of 10-
11% and 5.25-5.75%, respectively, in the second half of the
year.
Debt Issuances
• On May 18, 2023, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal
amount of 5.104% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due
2026 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.159%
fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2034.

This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the
same periods of 2022 and should be read in conjunction with the

Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Servicing and
management fees collectively made up approximately 71% of the total fee revenue in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, and 75%
and 74% for the same periods of 2022, respectively.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased 3% in the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period
of 2022, primarily driven by lower client activity and adjustments and below average pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Servicing
fees decreased 7% in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower average fixed income
market levels, client activity and adjustments and below average pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% and 46% of total servicing fees in the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, respectively, and 47% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by
several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our
services. We provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to
collectively as back office services and middle office services. The nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for which the services
are performed affect our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market
valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on
asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the valuation process is more
complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party information, AUC/A is reported on a time lag, typically
one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end market levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing
fees revenue by approximately 2% on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately (4)% and 8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
The impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees, which historically was included within client activity and asset flows,
is now reflected within change in market valuations. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected
indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios
can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices
presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of
June 30, 2023 that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our
servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of
approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of June 30, 2023, that
changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity
markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time. In periods of higher fixed income market
volatility such as we have been experiencing since the second quarter of 2022, the impact of fixed income markets on our servicing fee revenues may
increase.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity
and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our
servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are
invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other
considerations. Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees
revenue by approximately 0% on average with a range of (2)% to 1% annually and approximately 0% and (1)% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As
noted under "Changes in Market Valuations" in this section, this analysis now excludes, but in prior reporting previously included, the impact of
changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the
asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and
our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee
revenues by approximately 0% on average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 1% in both 2022 and 2021.
Gross investment servicing mandates were $141 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and $2.00 trillion per year on average over the past five
years. Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from approximately $0.79 trillion to
$3.52 trillion.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install
the assets, and the types of assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation
timeline, in general, can range from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years.
We expect that our more complex installations, including new State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With
respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.36 trillion that are yet to be installed as of June 30, 2023, we expect the conversion will
occur over the coming 24 months, with approximately 40% expected to be installed in the remainder of 2023 and approximately 60% in 2024. The
expected timing of these installations is subject to change due to a variety of factors, including adjusted implementation schedules agreed with clients,
scope adjustments, and product and functionality changes.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures
today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue
associated with AUC/A, once installed, can vary materially. On average, over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that pricing
pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (3)% annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (4)% in
any given year and approximately (2)% in both 2022 and 2021. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including
terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing
our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue
generated by anticipated additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing
concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client
investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, we estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year;
although, notwithstanding increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity
and asset flows, the manner in which we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors
described in this Form 10-Q.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have
been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing
fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 25% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable
in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will
vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of
activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher
volatility.

Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
Consistent with past practice, AUC/A values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.
Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the second quarter of 2023 totaled approximately $141 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be
installed in future periods totaled approximately $2.36 trillion as of June 30, 2023, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation
and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed
and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and
customary regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new
business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date
extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates
and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing
assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time the contract was
signed and are not updated based on subsequent developments, including changes in assets, market valuations, scope and, potentially, termination.
Such assets therefore do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their
relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody
and safekeeping, transaction processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting,
middle office services such as investment book of records, transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping,
client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX trading services, liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and
securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis, performance and attribution,
trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and ESG investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may
vary based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As previously disclosed, in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects
to move a significant portion of its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending necessary approvals. We expect to
continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business. The
transition began in 2022, but we expect it will principally occur in 2023 and 2024 and will impact our fee revenue and income growth trends most
notably beginning in the third quarter of 2023 through 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the fee revenue associated with the assets yet
to transition represented approximately 1.7% of our total fee revenue. The actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range
of factors, including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees decreased 6% in the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to net outflows
in prior periods and a shift of certain management fees into NII associated with management fees related to certain U.S. ETFs with unique structures,
partially offset by higher average market levels. Management fees decreased 9% in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same
period of 2022, primarily due to lower average market levels, the aforementioned shift of certain management fees into NII and cumulative net
outflows since June 30, 2022.

State Street Corporation | 14
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 26% of total management fees in both the three and six months ended June
30, 2023, and 25% and 26% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain
components of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by
daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion
of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations.
Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain
management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a
lower fee on AUM than for actively managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are
recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of June 30, 2023, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including
the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our
management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over
multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide
equity markets, will have a significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our
management fee revenue. Quarter-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and
Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and
classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can
therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in
Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased 8% in the three months ended
June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily
reflecting lower client FX volumes and FX volatility. Foreign exchange
trading services revenue decreased 7% in the six months ended
June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily
reflecting lower client FX volumes. Foreign exchange trading services
revenue comprises revenue generated by FX trading and revenue
generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up
63% and 37%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services
revenue in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 67% and 33%,
respectively, in the same period of 2022.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal
market-maker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX
trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at
negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that
contact our trading desk directly. These principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by
third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those
funds under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients,
for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment
managers, routed to our FX desk through our asset-servicing
operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at
rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors,
including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related
spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our
management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks
associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors
on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period.
For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases
or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend
to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in clientrelated FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to
executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us,
transition from indirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading
execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to one of our
electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as
a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX
execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution
process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under
custody at another bank.
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue
through "electronic FX services" and "other trading, transition
management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute
FX transactions through one of our electronic trading
platforms. These transactions generate revenue through a
“click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage
revenue: As our clients look to us to enhance and preserve
portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or
Currency Management capabilities or transact with our
Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which are
not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via
commissions charged for trades transacted during the
management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms:
it is a global trading, analytics and cash management tool with
access to more than 400 money market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total
Revenue, increased 9% in the three months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to higher agency
spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 11% in the six months
ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily due to higher agency spreads, partially offset by lower
agency balances.
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors
managed investment funds with a broad range of investment
objectives, which we refer to as the State Street Global
Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment
managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency
lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal,
which we refer to as our prime services business (previously
referred to as enhanced custody).
State Street Corporation | 17
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending
activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related
to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is
principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest
rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
As principal, our prime services business borrows securities
from the lending client or other market participants and then lends
such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a
broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending client is unable
to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the
transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we
provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we
source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our
role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source
securities through assets under custody from clients who have
designated us as an eligible borrower.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for
securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the
profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. In
addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including
revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of
those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities,
may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our
agency lending or prime services businesses, the volume of our
securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in
future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2:
Total Revenue, increased 18% in the three months ended June 30,
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by
higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
Software and processing fees revenue decreased 1% in the six
months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022,
primarily driven by lower lending related and other fees, partially
offset by higher front office software and data revenue associated
with CRD.
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of
fees and revenue, including fees from software licensing and
maintenance and fees from our structured products business.
Front office software and data revenue, which primarily includes
revenue from CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services,
increased 29% in the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily due to higher on-premises
renewals and higher software-enabled and professional services
revenue driven by continued
SaaS implementations and conversions. Front office software and
data revenue increased 3% in the six months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to higher
software-enabled revenue driven by continued SaaS implementations
and conversions, partially offset by lower on-premises renewals and
professional services revenue.
Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is
primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS,
including professional services such as consulting and
implementation services, software support and maintenance.
Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of
software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time
when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the
software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of
the contract and other contractual terms. The remainder of revenue
for on-premise installations is recognized over the length of the
contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon
renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of
revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon
renewal and the remaining balance recognized over the term of the
contract. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement, where the
customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized
over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal
of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as
services are provided under the new contract. As a result of these
differences in how portions of CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD
revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to quarter.
Lending related and other fees decreased 5% and 8% in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared
to the same periods of 2022, reflecting lower unfunded commitments
relating to our municipal and fund finance products, driven by
changes in product mix. Lending related and other fees primarily
consists of fee revenue associated with our fund finance, leverage
loans, municipal finance, insurance and stable value wrap
businesses.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and
income associated with other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue increased $101 million and $117 million in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared
to the same periods of 2022, primarily due to a tax credit investment
accounting change and the absence of negative market-related
adjustments. For the six month periods, the increases were partially
offset by lower positive fair value adjustments on equity investments.
For further information on the tax credit investment accounting
change, please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line
of Business Information" included in this Management's Discussion
and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income
and interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, compared to the same periods of 2022.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning
assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities.
Interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment
securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, loans, resale
agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client
deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII
and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is
calculated by dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets.
Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from
certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is
adjusted to an FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory
income tax rates.
NII increased 18% and 33% in the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022,
primarily due to higher short-term market rates from global central
bank rate
hikes, an increase in long-term interest rates and balance sheet
positioning. This was partially offset by lower average client deposits,
which included a mix shift from non-interest bearing towards interestbearing.
Investment securities' net purchase premium amortization,
which is included in interest income, was $11 million and $25 million
in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to $66 million and $153 million in the same periods of
2022. The decrease in MBS premium amortization is primarily due to
lower prepayments from higher long-end interest rates.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our
consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method,
or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual
or estimated life of the security. The rate of return considers any nonrefundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts,
resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. The amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments
when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities net
premium amortization (discount accretion) for the periods indicated:

2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.23% and 0.12% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 0.21% and 0.07% in the same periods of 2022, respectively.

respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 4.82% and 4.63% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 0.66% and 0.37% in the same periods of 2022, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below.
Additional information about the components of interest income and
interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $231.99 billion and
$234.74 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to $251.25 billion and $254.66 billion in the
same periods of 2022, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to
lower client deposit balances.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $69.08 billion
and $73.13 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to $76.53 billion and $76.64 billion in the
same periods of 2022, respectively. These deposits primarily reflect
our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the ECB
and other non-U.S. central banks. The lower levels of average cash
balances reflect lower levels of client deposits.
Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $1.63
billion and $1.64 billion in the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, respectively, compared to $2.02 billion and $2.58 billion in the
same periods of 2022, respectively. As a member of FICC, we may
net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those
purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also
members of the clearing organization, when specific netting criteria
are met. The impact of balance sheet netting was $139.55 billion and
$256.20 billion on average in the three and six months ended June
30, 2023, respectively, compared to $71.10 billion and $126.12 billion
in the same periods of 2022, respectively, primarily driven by an
increase in FICC repo volumes.
We are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a
sponsoring member within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale
transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with
other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities
Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may
sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with
FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full
payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’
respective obligations. We generally obtain a security interest from
our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they
receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may be required to pay a
pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide
liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the
extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund
obligation and the prescribed loss allocation to FICC is depleted. It is
difficult to estimate our maximum possible exposure under the
membership agreement, since this would require an assessment of
future claims that may be made against us that have not yet
occurred. We did not record any liabilities under these arrangements
as of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Average investment securities decreased to $107.55 billion and
$107.32 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, from $113.93 billion and $116.59 billion in the same
periods of 2022, respectively. The portfolio declined across most
major asset classes, which was primarily driven by a smaller balance
sheet from lower client deposits amidst a higher level of market rates.
Average loans decreased to $34.24 billion and $33.88 billion in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to $35.83 billion and $35.12 billion in the same periods of
2022, respectively, due to lower average overdrafts. Average core
loans, which exclude overdrafts, averaged $30.28 billion and
$29.75 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to $29.28 billion and $29.06 billion in the
same periods of 2022, respectively. Additional information about
these loans is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with
our prime services business, decreased to $18.78 billion and $18.09
billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
from $22.20 billion and $22.98 billion in the same periods of 2022,
respectively, primarily driven by a decrease in the level of cash
collateral posted. Other interest-earning assets primarily reflects
prime services assets where cash has been posted to borrow
securities from lenders, which are then lent by us, as principal, to
borrowers. This cash includes both cash from borrowers and cash
utilized from our balance sheet, and is presented on a net basis on
the balance sheet where we have enforceable netting agreements.
Non-interest earning assets also includes a portion of our prime
services assets where borrower-provided non-cash collateral has
been utilized to borrow securities from lenders, which are then lent by
us, as principal, to borrowers. In addition, we also use securities
within our investment portfolio to borrow securities from lenders,
which we subsequently loan, as principal, to our borrowers; in this
structure our investment portfolio securities are encumbered, but this
is not reflected on the balance sheet. Combined with our prime
services liabilities, revenue from these activities generates securities
finance fee revenue as well as net interest income.
State Street Corporation | 21
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Average total interest-bearing deposits decreased to $173.85
billion and $172.74 billion in the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, respectively, from $177.33 billion and $180.46 billion in the
same periods of 2022, respectively. The decrease was driven by the
higher market interest rate environment across most major
currencies, the impact of quantitative tightening and currency
translation. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying
asset servicing business, client behavior, the mix of interest-bearing
and non-interest bearing deposits and market conditions, including
the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.
Average short-term borrowings increased to $1.97 billion and
$1.56 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, from $0.68 billion and $0.78 billion in the same periods
of 2022, respectively.
Average long-term debt was $16.74 billion and $16.30 billion in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to $13.70 billion and $13.98 billion in the same periods of
2022, respectively. These amounts reflect issuances, redemptions
and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with
our prime services business, were $3.60 billion and $3.34 billion in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to $2.52 billion and $2.70 billion in the same periods of
2022, respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities is primarily driven
by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a
net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. Noninterest bearing liabilities also include a portion of our prime services
liabilities where client provided non-cash collateral has been received
and we have rehypothecation rights. Securities received as collateral
from our custody clients where we have no rehypothecation rights are
used as a credit mitigant only and remain off balance sheet.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM,
including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources;
central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes
in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or
proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of
those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased
compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured; and
changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including
regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the
proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in
highly-rated
U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal agency MBS, sovereign
debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The pace at
which we reinvest, and the types of investment securities purchased,
will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of
regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and
other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of
global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future
levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
We recorded an $18 million reserve release in the second
quarter of 2023, driven by the release of the allowance for credit
losses related to our support of a U.S. financial institution in the first
quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in loan loss reserves
associated with credit portfolio rating changes. The provision for
credit losses recorded in the second quarter of 2022 was $10 million.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial
Condition" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note
4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

Expenses
Table 15: Expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same
periods of 2022. Total expenses increased 5% and 3% in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the
same periods of 2022, primarily reflecting higher salaries, headcount
and business investments, partially offset by ongoing productivity
savings.

Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 7%
and 6% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022, primarily due to
higher salaries and headcount.
Total headcount increased 6% as of June 30, 2023 compared to
June 30, 2022, primarily driven by operational support for new
business growth segments, as well as technology investments and
in-sourcing.
Information systems and communications expenses increased
3% and was flat in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022. The increase
in the three month period relative to the prior year is primarily due to
higher technology infrastructure investments, partially offset by
optimization savings, insourcing and vendor savings initiatives.
Transaction processing services expenses decreased 2% and
6% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to the same periods of 2022, primarily due to lower subcustody costs.
Occupancy expenses increased 7% and 3% in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same
periods of 2022, primarily due to relocation of our headquarters,
temporarily resulting in overlapping cost.
Amortization of other intangible assets was flat and decreased
1% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively,
compared to the same periods of 2022.
Other expenses increased 9% and 10% in the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same
periods of 2022, primarily due to higher professional services, travel
costs and marketing expenses.
Acquisition and Restructuring Costs
We had no acquisition and restructuring costs in both the three
and six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $12 million and
$21 million in the same periods of 2022, respectively, related to the
BBH Investor Services acquisition transaction that we are no longer

Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $153 million and $292 million in the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared
to $88 million and $238 million in the same periods of 2022,
respectively. Our effective tax rate was 16.7% and 18.2% in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to
10.5% and 15.0% in the same periods of 2022, respectively, primarily
due to higher discrete benefits in the prior year from the
reassessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Income
tax expense for 2023 also included the impact of the tax credit
investment accounting change. For further information on the tax
credit investment accounting change, please refer to Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

Servicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 17: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, decreased 3% in the three months ended June 30,
2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower client activity and adjustments and below average pricing headwinds, partially
offset by net new business. Servicing fees decreased 7% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, primarily
driven by lower average fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and below average pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new
business.
For additional information about servicing fees and the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as
other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to "Fee Revenue" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 5% and 4% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the
same periods of 2022, as higher salaries, headcount and ongoing investments in our business were partially offset by continued productivity and
optimization savings. Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were $132 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023,
compared to $161 million in the same period of 2022. Additional information about expenses is provided under "Expenses" in "Consolidated Results

Investment Management total revenue increased 5% and 1% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the
same periods of 2022.
Management Fees
Management fees decreased 6% in the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to net outflows
in prior periods and a shift of certain management fees into NII associated with management fees related to certain U.S. ETFs with unique structures,
partially offset by higher average market levels. Management fees decreased 9% in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same
period of 2022, primarily due to lower average market levels, the aforementioned shift of certain management fees into NII and cumulative net
outflows since June 30, 2022.

expense and payroll taxes were $49 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $47 million in the same period of 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is
primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment
Servicing and Investment Management lines of business. Our clients'
needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume,
mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize
deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of
our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of interestbearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a
variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term
investment alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated
transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual
maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we
evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain
appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not
operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our
operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in
our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments,
such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities
purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is
determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire
to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio
is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio taking into
consideration the interest rate and duration characteristics of our
client liabilities and in the context of the overall structure of our
consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global
interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified, high-credit
quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in
the management of our consolidated statement of condition.

Domestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower’s country of domicile.
Fund finance loans include primarily $9.33 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $5.88 billion
loans to real money funds and $1.11 billion loans to business development companies as of June 30, 2023,
compared to $7.57 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.61 billion loans to real money funds
and $1.11 billion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2022.
Includes $1.85 billion securities finance loans, $289 million loans to municipalities and $6 million other
loans as of June 30, 2023 and $1.51 billion securities finance loans, $321 million loans to municipalities
and $42 million other loans as of December 31, 2022.
As of June 30, 2023, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $28.17 billion and fixed rate loans
totaled $2.87 billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash
flows associated with EURIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional details.
The decrease in domestic loans was primarily driven by lower
overdrafts, offset by an increase in other loans, and the increase in
foreign loans was primarily driven by fund finance loans, overdrafts
and collateralized loan obligations in loan form as of June 30, 2023
compared to December 31, 2022.
As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our leveraged
loans totaled approximately $3.46 billion and $3.55 billion,
respectively. We sold $125 million of leveraged loans in the second
quarter of 2023.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 of $111 million and
$98 million, respectively, to participate in syndications of leveraged
loans. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is
provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative”
under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the

statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or
“B,” with approximately 91% and 96% of the loans rated “BB” or “B”
as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our
investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to
larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial
institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each
potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty
and industry segment. However, these loans have significant
exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our
portfolio.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as
underlying classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Allowance for credit losses
TABLE 25: ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Six Months Ended June 30,
(In millions) 2023 2022
Allowance for credit losses:
Beginning balance $ 121 $ 108
Provision for credit losses (funded commitments) 34 12
Provisions for credit losses (unfunded commitments) (8) (2)
Charge-offs (11) (4)
Ending balance $ 136 $ 114
The provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial and financial loans.
The charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans.
We recorded a provision for credit losses of $26 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in loan
loss reserves associated with credit portfolio rating changes,
compared to a $10 million provision for credit losses recorded in the
same period of 2022.
As of June 30, 2023, approximately $80 million of our allowance
for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the
commercial and financial segment compared to $69 million as of
June 30, 2022. The remaining $56 million and $45 million as of
June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, was related to
commercial real estate loans, other loans, off-balance sheet
commitments, interest-bearing deposits with banks and other
financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment
securities. As of June 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses
represented 0.4% of total loans.
Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit
losses is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed
to a variety of risks, some that are inherent in the financial services
industry, and others that are more specific to our business activities.
Our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which
include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risks, including funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• operational resiliency risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities,
referred to as asset and liability management, consisting
primarily of interest rate risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each
of them, could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial
statements, and are discussed in detail on pages 23 to 52 included
under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including
our risk appetite framework and risk governance committee structure,
refer to pages 81 to 86 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, Risk Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a
counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a
counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or
settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms.
We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities,
such as overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our
investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty
exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as
securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal securities
lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other
settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other
cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions and
fees receivables.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Allowance for Credit Losses
We record an allowance for credit losses related to certain onbalance sheet credit exposures, including our financial assets held at
amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures,
including unfunded commitments and letters of credit. Review and
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is
ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is
based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in
the portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our
counterparties. We utilize multiple economic scenarios, consisting of
a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to develop our forecast
of expected losses.
In the second quarter of 2023, the allowance estimate reflected
a decrease in reserves, driven by the release of the allowance for
credit losses related to our support of a U.S. financial institution in the
first quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in loan loss
reserves associated with credit portfolio rating changes. Allowance
estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those inherent in our
model and economic assumptions, and management may use
qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to
the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as
of June 30, 2023 or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than
forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our
allowance for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is
provided in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in
this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management
framework, including our core policies and principles, structure and
organization, credit ratings, risk parameter estimates, credit risk
mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring and controls, refer to
pages 86 to 91 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to
our liquidity based on our activities, size and other appropriate riskrelated factors. In managing liquidity risk, we employ limits, maintain
established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine
stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process
involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external
scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in
identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in
available sources of cash, as well as the
potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital
markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well
as on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company and at certain
branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank
generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to
banks, such as the federal funds market, the Federal Reserve's
discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program. The Parent
Company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile,
reflecting narrower market access. Additionally, the Parent Company
typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through SSIF, a
direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support agreement,
as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash and equivalents intended to
meet its current debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as
those projected over the next twelve-month period. Reference our
SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this
Management's Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at
the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to
be available to the Parent Company. As of June 30, 2023, our Parent
Company and State Street Bank had approximately $0.99 billion of
senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature
in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk
management activities are subject to heightened and evolving
regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those
requirements, under specific U.S. and international regulations and
also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory
activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements
could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our
investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of
certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we
deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive
negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan
deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or
otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our efforts to satisfy,
or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as
well as liquidity metrics, refer to pages 91 to 96 included under Item
7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk Management, in
State Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
our 2022 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity ratios,
including LCR and the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 15
included under Item 1, Business, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity,
which consists primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid
assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. As a banking
organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the LCR rule
approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to
promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking
organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to
absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day
period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity
risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash
outflows. HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain
high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR
rule. Net cash outflows are measured as prescribed under the LCR
rule which provides a significant benefit for deposits classified as
operational. We report the LCR to the Federal Reserve daily. For the
quarters ended June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, daily
average LCR for the Parent Company was 108% and 106%,
respectively. The impact of higher deposits on the Parent Company's
LCR is limited by a cap, known as the transferability restriction, on
the HQLA from State Street Bank and Trust that can be recognized at
the Parent Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule. This
restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent
Company's LCR to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal
banking subsidiary (State Street Bank and Trust). The average
HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the Parent Company under the
LCR final rule definition was $125.84 billion for the quarter ended
June 30, 2023 compared to $139.88 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in client deposits
relative to the prior period. For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the
LCR for State Street Bank and Trust was approximately 120%.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory
requirements governing deposits with the Federal Reserve, the ECB
and other non-U.S. central banks of approximately $65.42 billion for
the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to $79.52 billion for the
quarter ended December 31, 2022. The lower levels of average cash
balances with central banks reflect lower levels of client deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities
pledged without corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston
(FRBB), the FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street
Bank is a member of the FHLB. This membership allows for
advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral,
which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. We had no
outstanding borrowings from the FHLB as of June 30, 2023 and had
$2.0 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
Access to primary, intraday and contingent liquidity provided by
these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with
utilization subject to underlying conditions. As of both June 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding primary credit
borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other central bank
facility.
In addition to the investment securities included in our asset
liquidity, we have other unencumbered investment securities and
certain loans that we can pledge as collateral to access these various
facilities. These additional assets are available sources of liquidity
and not included in our LCR asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was
$77.53 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to
$78.25 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following:
withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of
lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions;
increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other permitted
purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress
conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of
our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment
portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources
of securities under our prime services program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross
contractual amounts totaling $34.47 billion and $31.20 billion and
standby letters of credit totaling $1.59 billion and $2.13 billion as of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These amounts
do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of June 30, 2023,
approximately 75% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit
and 35% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since
many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without
being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily
represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to
submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC (the
State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our
preferred resolution strategy and to demonstrate that we have the
resources and capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of
major financial distress. Through resolution planning, we seek to
maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial
system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published in the Federal Register on November 1,
2019 requires a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on
an alternating basis in the relevant submission years. We submitted
our updated 2023 165(d) resolution plan by July 1, 2023. Under the
165(d) rule, results are due from the Agencies by July 1, 2024, unless
the deadline is extended due to extenuating circumstances. Our next
165(d) resolution plan submission to the Agencies is due by July 1,
2025.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred
resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy
provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the Parent Company and
pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF
(a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities
(as defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated,
up to its available resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to
State Street Bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital
and/or liquidity support (collectively with State Street Bank,
“Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the
Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution
proceedings. Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity
to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a
bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The
Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to
a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for
the benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has prefunded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid
assets, cash deposits, investments in intercompany debt,
investments in marketable securities and other cash and non-cash
equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the support
agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent
available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these
contributions, SSIF has agreed in the support agreement to provide
capital and liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the
Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company’s capital
and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its
upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a
potential
bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has provided the Parent Company with
a committed credit line and issued (and may issue) one or more
promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent
Company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period
prior to the occurrence of a "Recapitalization Event", which is defined
under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of: (1) one or
more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or (2) the
authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the
Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of
resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement
the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations
outstanding under the Parent Company Funding Notes would
automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to
SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company and SSIF under the
support agreement are secured through a security agreement that
grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would
use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the
Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the
Parent Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on
an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank
and our other Beneficiary Entities. To support this process, we have
established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would
need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain
events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds are
set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital
and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary
government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a
stabilized institution with market confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF
would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent
Company; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contribute to
SSIF any remaining assets it is required to contribute to SSIF under
the support agreement, (which specifically exclude amounts
designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy
proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and
liquidity support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’
continued operation to the extent of its available resources and
consistent with the support agreement; and (4) the Parent Company
would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No
State Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
person or entity, other than a party to the support agreement, should
rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a Beneficiary Entity or
receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support
agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's
perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual
relationship with any of our entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the
FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an
IDI plan. We submitted our last IDI plan before July 1, 2018. In
November 2018, the FDIC had announced that until the FDIC
completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would
be required to be filed. On June 25, 2021, the FDIC issued a policy
statement on resolution plans for IDIs that allows for content
streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a three-year
cycle. State Street Bank’s next IDI plan submission deadline is
December 1, 2023.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan to the
Federal Reserve. This plan includes detailed governance triggers and
contingency actions that can be implemented in a timely manner in
the event of extreme financial distress. We also have recovery
planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we
operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody,
accounting, administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash
management, financial asset management, securities finance and
investment advisory services. As a provider of these products and
services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided
a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients
place deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of June 30,
2023, approximately 67% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 16% in EUR, 6% in GBP and 11% in all
other currencies. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 67% of
our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars,
16% in EUR, 7% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral
component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets
provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more
importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging
the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability
to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier
under “Asset Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB
allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality
collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities
lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are
short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by
high-quality investment securities. These balances were $4.29 billion
and $1.18 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively.
State Street Bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a
financial institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.06
billion as of June 30, 2023, to support its Canadian securities
processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination
date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. As of both
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was no balance
outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our
current universal shelf registration statement to meet current
commitments and business needs.
On May 18, 2023, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal
amount of 5.104% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2026 and $1
billion aggregate principal amount of 5.159% fixed-to-floating rate
senior notes due 2034.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered
by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by
major credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high
credit ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets
and client deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving
our ability to offer products;
State Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending
transactions; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit
ratings.
A downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a
material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to
access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of
funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale
withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger
requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require
additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative
contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into
under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to
post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our
credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by
determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by major rating agencies. The additional collateral or
termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under
these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in
the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified
in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for
which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems or from external
events.
Tight labor markets, challenging conditions in the global equity
and fixed income markets, and heightened geopolitical tensions,
including the ongoing war in Ukraine, are resulting in stress on the
operating environment and have increased, and may continue to
increase, operational risk. The war in Ukraine may also heighten
information technology risk exposures, including cyber-threats. See
also “Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework,
refer to pages 97 to 100 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated
with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and
adoption of information
technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by
technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information
security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology
internal control and process gaps, technology operational events and
adoption of new business technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk
framework and associated risks, refer to pages 100 to 101 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, "Information Technology Risk
Management" in our 2022 Form 10-K, and pages 47 to 48 included
under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2022 Form 10-K - "Any failures of
or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information
technology systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous
operations, including the systems, facilities or operations of third
parties with which we do business, such as resulting from cyberattacks, could result in significant costs, reputational damage and
limits on our ability to conduct our business activities".
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of
loss that could result from broad market movements, such as
changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign
exchange rates or commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk
in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-andliability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities is provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information
about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which
consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under “Assetand-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk,
the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business
objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market
volatility and our execution against those factors.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the
foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling
cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including
foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest
rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts
and interest rate futures. As of June 30, 2023, the notional amount of
these derivative contracts was $2.50 trillion, of which $2.47 trillion
was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot
contracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of
mitigating related

currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are
valued daily at current market rates.

Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies,
including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given
period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk
measurement methodology to measure trading-related VaR daily. We
have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR, and we
maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory
market risk requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is
calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during
a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99%
confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same
model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to
historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that
reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model is
designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst
continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed
VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period
with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during
that twelve-month period of financial stress. For each portfolio, the
stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year
time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from
within the available historical data. This historical data set includes
the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the
Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard & Poor's
downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the historical
data set used to determine the stress period expands over time,
future market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools
and methodologies, refer to pages 103 to 108 included under Item 7,
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2022
Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that
incorporates techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer
in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial
conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as
concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We
conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical
stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate
the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market
conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the
Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted,
analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and
risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and
volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily
basis by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the
Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC). Limit breaches are
addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business
units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the CMRC if
material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that
prompt review by management and the implementation of a
remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our
VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level.
This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR model
outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from
daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean”
P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions
and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not
specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities
themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and
gains or losses from intraday activity.
We had no back-testing exceptions in the quarters ended
June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022. At a 99%
confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to
witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three
exceptions per year).

The three month average of our total stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $37 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023,
compared to an average of approximately $35 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and $41 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The
slight increase in the average total stressed VaR for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, is primarily
attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite
for taking market risk in our trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual
market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction in VaR measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to
regulatory review and approval, and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based
measures.

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that
is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the
economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates.
While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our
exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest
these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet
mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast
of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 30, Key Interest Rates for Baseline
Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2023 and 2022. Our baseline rate forecast as of
June 30, 2023 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at that point in time, which implied that rates
may reach peak levels toward the end of 2023 and rate cuts may begin in 2024.

In Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous 100 basis
point shocks to various tenors on the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each
scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance. While
investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis
our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance rotation, including
reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. The results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated for other (e.g., more severe) shocks as
the impact of interest rate shocks may not be linear. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result
is negative interest rates.

The short-end is 0-3 months. The long-end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.
Our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an NII benefit in higher rate scenarios. Our USD balance
sheet has become liability sensitive driven by higher deposit betas resulting in an NII exposure to higher rate scenarios.
As of June 30, 2023, USD NII benefits from lower rate scenarios and is exposed to higher rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the shortend of the yield curve. Compared to June 30, 2022, our short-end USD NII exposure to higher interest rates increased due to the higher level of
baseline market interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program, resulting in higher deposit betas and deposit balance
rotation and reductions. Long-end USD sensitivities have decreased since June 30, 2022 as the implementation of investment portfolio risk reduction
strategies lowered our forecasted long-end reinvestment.
As of June 30, 2023, non-USD NII benefits in higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the
short-end of the yield curve. Compared to June 30, 2022, our short-end non-USD sensitivity to both higher and lower rates decreased due to rising
deposit betas and deposit balance rotation and reduction.
USD and non-USD NII sensitivities are also impacted by routine currency-level baseline forecasting updates and refinements, including deposit
betas.
NII sensitivity is routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial
services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on
sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial
decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a
significant advancement in financial management and a source of
risk. In large banking organizations like us, model results influence
business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on
our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management
Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management
framework, including our governance and model validation, refer to
pages 109 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Model Risk Management", in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on
earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper
implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to
industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in
the competitive environment; decline in market performance or
changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary
impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest
rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate
strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and
capital management processes. Management of strategic risk is an
integral component of all aspects of our business.
Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into
operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the
direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or
penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the
impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of
clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a
strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the
integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the
operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to
retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a
loss due to strategic risk.
Strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for
its assessment and management include the development of
business plans, which are subject to review and challenge from
senior management and the Board of Directors, as well as a
formal review and approval process for all new business and product
proposals. The potential impact of the various elements of strategic
risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a
combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stresstesting and management judgment to help assess the potential effect
on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and control of
strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units,
with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall
strategic planning and internal risk management processes.
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and
projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are
in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are
sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future
strategic business initiatives. We assess capital adequacy based on
relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal
capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as
evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an
additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set
forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we
are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to the
required minimum of 3.0% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to
exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to
increased restrictions (depending upon the extent of the shortfall)
regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus
payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as
systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree
of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore
some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital,
liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 110
to 117 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form
10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking
organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are
also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by U.S.
banking regulators.
The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for
monitoring capital adequacy: the “standardized approach" and the
“advanced
State Street Corporation | 40
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
approaches", applicable to advanced approaches banking
organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes
standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk
weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures. The
advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal RatingsBased Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk,
and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of
RWA related to operational risk.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, we and
State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to as the Collins
Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy,
such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment
purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced
approaches and the standardized approach. Under the advanced
approaches, State Street and State Street Bank are subject to a
2.5% CCB requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital
buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. Under the
standardized approach, State Street Bank is subject to the same
CCB and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, but for State
Street, the 2.5% CCB requirement is replaced by the SCB
requirement according to the SCB rule issued in 2020. In addition,
State Street is subject to a G-SIB surcharge.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB
with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s
starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely
adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as
a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the
CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than
2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or
surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital
distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by U.S.
banking regulators.
Our current SCB requirement is 2.5% for the period from
October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. On June 28, 2023, we
were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2023
supervisory stress test. Our preliminary SCB calculated under the
2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum,
resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will go into effect starting
October 1, 2023 and will run through September 30, 2024.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2023,
include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced
approaches and
standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and
a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This results in minimum risk-based
ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio,
9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2023, is
1.0%. Based on a calculation date of December 31, 2022, our G-SIB
surcharge will be 1.0% through December 31, 2024.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial
holding company, we and our insured depository institution
subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well
capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to
calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for
certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as “covered
positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR
measures. The rule also requires a public disclosure composed of
qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk
associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and
stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative and quantitative information
required by the rule is provided under "Market Risk Management"
included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking agencies issued their proposed
rule to implement the Basel III endgame agreement for large banks
and adjustments to the surcharge for U.S. global systemically
important banks. The deadline for comments on the proposed rule is
November 30, 2023.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 110
to 117 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form
10-K.
The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and
related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the
dates indicated. We are subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and
those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment
of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include AOCI hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities,
disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk-based deductions.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the
Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss
event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization
dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the
advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 28, 2023, we were notified by
the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2023 supervisory stress test. Our preliminary SCB calculated under the 2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will be in effect from October
1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our CET1 capital decreased $1.05 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to common share repurchases
and dividends declared in the first half of 2023, partially offset by net income. Our Tier 1 capital decreased $1.05 billion as of June 30, 2023,
compared to December 31, 2022, under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach, due to the decrease in CET1 capital.
Our Tier 2 capital remained flat as of June 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under both the advanced approaches and standardized
approach.
Our total capital decreased by $1.05 billion and $1.04 billion as of June 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under the advanced
approaches and standardized approach, respectively, primarily due to the decrease in CET1 capital.
The table below presents a roll-forward of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and for the year

 Not applicable
As of June 30, 2023, total advanced approaches RWA increased $1.16 billion compared to December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in
credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA primarily reflects higher repo-style transactions, driven by increased volume and higher equity
markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in investment securities RWA, related to agency securities.
As of June 30, 2023, total standardized approach RWA increased $6.80 billion compared to December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in
credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA primarily reflects higher repo-style transactions, driven by increased volume and higher equity
markets, higher loans RWA, related to new capital call commitments, and higher derivatives RWA, driven by market volatility.
The regulatory capital ratios as of June 30, 2023, presented in Table 32: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are
calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based
ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of June 30, 2023, based on our and external data,
quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by
us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant
components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually
or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical
experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory
interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss
experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our
advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An
operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced
approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the
distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results
of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision
or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital
ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be
material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject
to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The
Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly
average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs
from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage
ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR
additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must maintain
a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. GSIB, we must maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any
limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus
payments to certain executives. If we do not maintain this buffer,
limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments
would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

The SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least
6.0% to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii)
we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio
requirement of 5.0%.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean
holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as
us, is intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain
U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards,
and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory
capital and LTD) and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
External TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus
2.5% plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for
these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus
any applicable countercyclical buffer, which is
currently 0%); and
• 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5%
minimum plus the SLR buffer of 2.0%), as
defined by the SLR final rule.

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In
addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on
dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 56 to 58 in "Related Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and pages 165 to 167 in Note 15 to the consolidated financial
statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are
subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market
purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing
and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period
to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our financial performance, investment opportunities, market
conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock issued as part of
employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most
circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though
these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring
processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $279.32 billion and $348.92 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed.
We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral
is required to be returned to the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $290.61 billion and $366.90 billion as collateral for
indemnified securities on loan as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
State Street Corporation | 47
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party
repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified
repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the
indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral
of $290.61 billion and $366.90 billion, referenced above, $58.44 billion and $54.11 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We or our agents held $62.94 billion and $57.90 billion as collateral for indemnified investments
in repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7, 9 and 11 to the

OTHER MATTERS
Closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and Related FDIC Matters
On March 12 and 13, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) and Signature Bank and the appointment of the FDIC as the
receiver for those banks, the FDIC announced that, under the systemic risk exception set forth in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), all
insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the respective bridge banks for SVB and Signature Bank.
The FDIC also announced that, as required by the FDIA, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to support uninsured depositors
would be recovered by a special assessment. On May 22, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would impose
special assessments to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk
determination announced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of SVB and Signature Bank, as required by the FDIA. The assessment base for
the special assessments would be equal to an insured depository institution’s (IDI) estimated uninsured deposits, reported as of December 31, 2022,
adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for IDIs that are part of a holding company with one or more
subsidiary IDIs, at the banking organization level. The FDIC is proposing to collect special assessments at an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis
points, over eight quarterly assessment periods, which it estimates will result in total revenue of $15.8 billion. Because the estimated loss pursuant to
the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC would retain the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment
collection period one or more quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period to collect the difference between actual or estimated losses
and the amounts collected, or impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis after the receiverships for SVB and Signature Bank
terminate. The FDIC is proposing an effective date of January 1, 2024, with special assessments collected beginning with the first quarterly
assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024, with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024).
We presently estimate, based on the FDIC’s May 2023 proposed rule, that the total pre-tax amount of State Street Bank’s special assessment
will be approximately $360 million, although the timing, amount and allocation of that special assessment remains subject to the provisions of the
FDIC’s final rule, when effective, as well as any actions by the FDIC, as described above, to cease collection early, extend the collection period, or
impose a final shortfall special assessment. The special assessment is expected to be recognized, in full, in the reporting period in which the final rule
is published.
