MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation is one of the world’s largest providers of financial
services to institutional investors. Our clients - asset managers and owners,
insurance companies, official institutions, and central banks - rely on us to deliver
solutions that support their goals across the investment life cycle.
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial
strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal
banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State
Street Bank, we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including
in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We provide a
broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide,
with $40.02 trillion of AUC/A and $3.69 trillion of AUM as of September 30, 2023.
As of September 30, 2023, we had consolidated total assets of $284.42 billion,
consolidated total deposits of $213.00 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $23.62 billion and approximately 42,000 employees.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Our executive offices are located at One Congress Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02114 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (Form 10-Q),
unless the context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our"
or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of this Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2022 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 previously filed with the SEC
(2022 Form 10-K). The financial information contained in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q should be
read in conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our 2022
Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-Q have
been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of
certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex, about matters
that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
• Recurring fair value measurements;
• Allowance for credit losses;
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• Contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex
judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision
as new information becomes available. For additional information about these
significant accounting policies refer to pages 120 to 122, “Significant Accounting
Estimates” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form 10-K. We did not
change these significant accounting policies in the first nine months of 2023.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, is presented using both a U.S. GAAP, or
reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used
in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain
financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management
uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to,
financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP
financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently
applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. As part of our
State Street Corporation | 4
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
non-GAAP-basis measures, we present a fully taxable-equivalent NII that reports
non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with tax-exempt
investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which we believe
facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial
performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory
standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with
respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading
activities), the LCR and NSFR, summary results of semi-annual State Street-run
stress tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and recovery and
resolution plan disclosures. These additional disclosures are accessible on the
"Filings & reports" tab of our corporate website at investors.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual
reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and
abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us
under the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other
public statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in
our Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as
applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
U.S. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations
regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations,
strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio
performance, ESG, human capital, climate, dividend and stock purchase programs,
acquisitions, outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, leverage ratios, joint
ventures and divestitures, client growth and new technologies, services, asset
installations and opportunities, as well as industry, governmental, regulatory,
economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business
environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “objective,” "outcome,"
“forecast,” "future," “outlook,” “believe,” “priority,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,”
“may,” “will,” “trend,” “target,” “strategy,” “goal,” "aim," "pipeline," "trajectory" and
"guidance" or similar
statements or variations of such terms, are intended to identify forward-looking
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
which change over time, are based on management's expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future
results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of
the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of
factors affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the
equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to
State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could
cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking
statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not
limited to:
Strategic Risks
• We are subject to intense competition, which could negatively affect our
profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability in our financial
results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and services, including
State Street Alpha or State Street Digital , and the enhancement of our
infrastructure required to meet increased regulatory and client expectations
for resiliency and the systems and process re-engineering necessary to
achieve improved productivity and reduced operating risk, involve costs,
risks and dependencies on third parties;
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and
maintain our technology infrastructure or as a result of a cyber-attack or
similar vulnerability in our or business partners' infrastructure;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and the
integration, retention and development of the benefits of these transactions,
including the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India,
pose risks for our business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support
our business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by geopolitical, economic and market
conditions, including, for example, as a result of liquidity or capital
deficiencies (actual or perceived) by other financial institutions and related
market and government actions, the Israel-Hamas war, ongoing war in
Ukraine, actions taken by central banks to address inflationary pressures,
challenging conditions in global equity markets, periods of significant
volatility in valuations and liquidity or other disruptions in the markets for
equity, fixed income and other asset classes globally or within specific
markets such as those that impacted the UK gilts in the fourth quarter of
2022;
• We have significant international operations and clients that can be
adversely impacted by developments in European and Asian economies,
including local, regional and geopolitical developments affecting those
economies;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and
consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes
in the financial markets, governmental action or monetary policy. For
example, among other risks, increases in prevailing interest rates have, and
could further, lead to reduced levels of client deposits and resulting
decreases in our NII;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk of counterparties, who may also have
substantial financial dependencies on other financial institutions, and these
credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our revenue and is
subject to decline based on, among other factors, market and currency
declines, investment activities and preferences of our clients and their
business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, our financial
condition, capital ratios, results of operations and business prospects could
be adversely affected;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not
be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an actual or
perceived reduction in our financial strength, our borrowing and capital
costs, liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common share
repurchases, may be adversely affected by regulatory capital, credit
(counterparty and otherwise) and liquidity standards and considerations;
• We face extensive and changing governmental regulation in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and
compliance risks and may affect our business activities and strategies;
• We are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of the resolution
of prior regulatory or governmental matters;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and
litigation;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased and conflicting
political and regulatory scrutiny of asset management stewardship and
corporate ESG practices;
• Our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and
may result in the identification of additional billing errors;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have
an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory
actions, litigation and other adverse effects;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios depend on
data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are
subject to change, which could materially impact our risk exposures, our
total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated
results of operations and financial condition;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions
and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our
effective tax rate;
• We could face liabilities for withholding and other non-income taxes,
including in connection with our services to clients, as a result of tax
authority examinations; and
• The transition away from LIBOR may result in additional costs and
increased risk exposure.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Operational Risks
• Our internal control environment may be inadequate, fail or be
circumvented, and operational risks could adversely affect our business and
consolidated results of operations;
• Shifting operational activities to non-U.S. jurisdictions, changing our
operating model and outsourcing to, or insourcing from, third parties
portions of our operations may expose us to increased operational risk,
geopolitical risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost
savings or operational improvements;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information
technology systems or facilities, or disruptions to our or their operations,
could result in significant costs, reputational damage and impacts on our
business activities;
• Long-term contracts and customizing service delivery for clients expose us
to pricing and performance risk;
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other
reputational harm;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or may infringe upon
the rights of third parties;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors
that could adversely impact our business and regulatory compliance;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur
substantial losses or are restricted in redeeming their interests in
investment pools that we sponsor or manage;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses to such risks,
could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including terrorist
attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a new pandemic or acts of
embezzlement.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our
forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the
factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our
other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be
relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no
obligation to revise our
forward-looking statements after the time they are made. The factors discussed
herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties that
may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all developments that may
adversely affect our business or operations or our consolidated results of
operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions and should
not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in
State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings,
including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our
annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act
of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the
"Filings & reports" tab of our corporate website at investors.statestreet.com.

The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section provides information
related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial
results for the third quarter of 2023 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial
Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including
the comparison of our financial results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods
of 2022, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line of Business
Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as in our
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. In this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign
currency translation, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted
average FX rates from the relevant 2022 period to the relevant 2023 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Third quarter of 2023 financial performance:
◦ Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.25, in the third quarter of 2023,
decreased 31% as compared to the same period of 2022, and
includes a pre-tax loss on sale of investment securities of
approximately $294 million related to an investment portfolio
repositioning which decreased EPS by $0.68 in the third quarter of
2023.
◦ Total revenue decreased 9% in the third quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, as the loss on sale of investment
securities and lower NII were partially offset by higher fee revenue.
◦ Total expenses increased 3% in the third quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting higher salaries and
continued business investments, partially offset by productivity
savings and the absence of acquisition and restructuring costs
incurred in the third quarter of 2022.
◦ Return on equity was 7.3%, a decrease from 11.2% in the same
period of 2022, primarily due to the loss on sale of investment
securities which contributed 3.9% points to the decrease in the third
quarter of 2023. Pre-tax margin of 19.0% in the third quarter of
2023 decreased from 28.7% in the same period of 2022, primarily
due to the loss on sale of investment securities and higher
expenses.
◦ Operating leverage was negative 12.4% points in the third quarter
of 2023. Pre-tax loss on sale of investment securities decreased
operating leverage by 9.9% points in the third quarter of 2023.
Operating leverage represents the difference between the
percentage change in

(2)
nm
State Street Corporation | 8
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
total revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each
case relative to the same period of the prior year.
◦ Fee operating leverage was positive 0.6% points in the third quarter
of 2023. Fee operating leverage represents the difference between
the percentage change in total fee revenue and the percentage
change in total expenses, in each case relative to the same period
of the prior year.
◦ We returned approximately $1.2 billion to our shareholders in the
form of common stock dividends and common share repurchases.
Revenue
• Total fee revenue increased 3% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to
the same period of 2022, reflecting higher servicing fees, management
fees, software and processing fees and other fee revenue, partially offset by
lower securities finance and FX trading services revenue.
• Servicing fee revenue increased 1% in the third quarter of 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by higher average equity
market levels, net new business and the impact of currency translation,
partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing
headwinds.
• Management fee revenue increased 1% in the third quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, as higher average equity market
levels were partially offset by a previously disclosed shift of certain
management fees into NII.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue decreased 2% in the third
quarter of 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting
lower direct FX spreads and muted market volatility, partially offset by
higher client FX volumes.
• Securities finance revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to lower agency
balances and lower specials activity.
• Software and processing fees revenue increased 2% in the third quarter of
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by higher front
office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
• Other fee revenue increased $49 million in the third quarter of 2023,
compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to a previously
disclosed tax credit investment accounting change and smaller negative
market-related adjustments.
• NII decreased 5% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the same period
of 2022, primarily due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix
shift towards interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the impact of
higher interest rates.
• Other income includes a loss on sale of AFS securities recorded in the third
quarter of 2023 of approximately $294 million, related to the investment
portfolio repositioning, which we expect to benefit NII in future periods.
Provision for Credit Losses
• We recorded no provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2023, as
an increase in reserves for commercial real estate loans was offset by a
reduction in reserves related to leveraged loans.
Expenses
• Total expenses increased 3% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the
same period of 2022, primarily reflecting higher salaries and continued
business investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the
absence of acquisition and restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter
of 2022.
Notable items
• Notable items in the third quarter of 2023 included a loss on the sale of
investment securities of approximately $294 million relating to the
investment portfolio repositioning.
• Notable items in the third quarter of 2022 comprised acquisition and
restructuring costs of approximately $13 million related to the BBH Investor
Services acquisition transaction that we are no longer pursuing.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $40.02 trillion as of September 30, 2023, increased 12%
compared to September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher quarter-end
equity market levels and net new business. In the third quarter of 2023,
newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $149
billion. We onboarded approximately $247 billion of AUC/A during the third
quarter of 2023. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods
totaled approximately $2.26 trillion as of September 30, 2023.
State Street Corporation | 9
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• AUM of $3.7 trillion as of September 30, 2023, increased 12.9% compared
to September 30, 2022, primarily due to higher quarter-end market levels.
Capital
• In the third quarter of 2023, we returned a total of approximately $1.2 billion
of capital to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and
common share repurchases.
◦ We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.69 per
share, totaling $213 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to
$0.63 per share, totaling $232 million in the same period of 2022.
◦ In the third quarter of 2023, we acquired an aggregate of 13.8
million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of
$72.23 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.0 billion. These
purchases were all conducted under the share repurchase program
approved by our Board of Directors in January 2023, authorizing
the purchase of up to $4.5 billion of our common stock through
December 31, 2023.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 11.0% as of September
30, 2023, compared to 13.6% as of December 31, 2022, primarily driven by
the continuation of common share repurchases and higher RWA, partially
offset by retained earnings. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 5.8% as
of September 30, 2023, compared to 6.0% as of December 31, 2022,
primarily driven by the continuation of common share repurchases, partially
offset by lower consolidated average assets. Given the current global
economic environment, and our plans for share repurchases, we currently
expect our CET1 capital ratio to remain within our target range of 10-11%
and our Tier 1 leverage ratio to move into our target range of 5.25-5.75% in
the fourth quarter of 2023.
Debt Issuances
• On August 3, 2023, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
5.272% fixed rate senior notes due 2026 and $300 million aggregate
principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2026.
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods of 2022 and
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and

Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by
higher average equity market levels, net new business and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds.
Servicing fees decreased 4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by lower average fixed income market levels,
client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average equity market levels and net new business.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% and 46% of total servicing fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and
45% and 46% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors, including
changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to our clients,
including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle office services. The nature and mix of
services provided and the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding
impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our
clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party
information, AUC/A is reported on a time lag, typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end
market levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately
2% on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately (4)% and 8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on
our servicing fees, which historically was included within client activity and asset flows, is now reflected within change in market valuations. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End
Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to
individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices
presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2023 that a 10%
increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a
corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain
constant and using relevant information as of September 30, 2023, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically
less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time. In periods of higher fixed income market
volatility such as we have been experiencing since the second quarter of 2022, the impact of fixed income markets on our servicing fee revenues may increase.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire
transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors,
including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five
years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately 0% on average with a range of
(2)% to 1% annually and approximately 0% and (1)% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As noted under "Changes in Market Valuations" in this section, this analysis now excludes, but
in prior reporting previously included, the impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow
information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our
flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2022, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on
average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 1% in both 2022 and 2021.
Gross investment servicing mandates, were $149 billion of AUC/A in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.00 trillion of AUC/A per year on average over the five years ended
December 31, 2022, ranging from approximately $0.79 trillion to $3.52 trillion of AUC/A annually in any given year.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of
assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from
6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. We expect that our more complex installations, including new State
Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.26 trillion of AUC/A that are yet to be
installed as of September 30, 2023, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 24 months, with approximately 15% expected to be installed in the remainder of 2023,
approximately 75% in 2024 and approximately 10% in 2025. The expected timing of these installations is subject to change due to a variety of factors, including adjusted
implementation schedules agreed with clients, scope adjustments, and product and functionality changes.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no
assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A, once installed, can vary materially. On
average, over the five years ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (3)%
annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (4)% in any given year and approximately (2)% in both 2022 and 2021. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation
with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our
dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional
services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to
onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when
we win business from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, we estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year; although, notwithstanding
increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner in which we price our
services, the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors described in this Form 10-Q.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes
in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we
serve; and the remaining approximately 25% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of
products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee
revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.

Certain previously reported amounts presented have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
Consistent with past practice, AUC/A values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.
Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the third quarter of 2023 totaled approximately $149 billion of AUC/A. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods
totaled approximately $2.26 trillion as of September 30, 2023, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in
subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals.
New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has
not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant,
will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing
mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time the contract was signed and
are not updated based on subsequent developments, including changes in assets, market valuations, scope and, potentially, termination. Such assets therefore do not include the
impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping, transaction
processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as investment book of records,
transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX trading services,
liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis,
performance and attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and ESG investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary
based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As previously disclosed, in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its
ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to
continue to be meaningful to our business. The transition began in 2022, but we expect it will principally occur in 2023 and 2024 and will impact our fee revenue and income growth
trends most notably beginning in the third quarter of 2023 through 2025. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the fee revenue associated with the assets yet to transition
represented approximately 1.7% of our total fee revenue. The actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range of factors, including potential growth in our
continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees increased 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, as higher average equity market levels were partially
offset by a previously disclosed shift of certain management fees into NII. Management fees decreased 6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same
period of 2022, primarily due to the aforementioned shift of certain management fees into NII, client insourcing and cumulative net outflows since September 30, 2022.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 25% and 26% of total management fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively, and 25% and 26% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets,
such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is
more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are
dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee
revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively
managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks
associated with the applicable account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2023, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business
won and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would
result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a
significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Quarter-end
indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant
indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total
Revenue, decreased 2% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting lower direct FX spreads and muted
market volatility, partially offset by higher client FX volumes. Foreign exchange
trading services revenue decreased 5% in the nine months ended September 30,
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily reflecting lower direct FX
spreads, a decline in market volatility and lower client FX volumes. Foreign
exchange trading services revenue comprises revenue generated by FX trading and
revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 63%
and 37%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the third
quarter of 2023, compared to 65% and 35%, respectively, in the same period of
2022.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker
through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with
clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly.
These principal market-making activities include transactions for funds
serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds
under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we
are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX
desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades
as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume
and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting
market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other
market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors
on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period. For example,
assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or
bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the
case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX
transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading
to either direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to
one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a
principal market-maker,
enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade
execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under
custody at another bank.
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic
FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions
through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions
generate revenue through a “click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which
are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions
charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global
trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money
market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased
6% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period
of 2022, primarily due to lower agency balances and lower specials activity.
Securities finance revenue increased 5% in the nine months ended September 30,
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, as higher spreads were partially offset
by lower agency balances.
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we
refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset
owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer
to as our prime services business (previously referred to as enhanced
custody).
State Street Corporation | 18
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is
composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees
related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on
loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
As principal, our prime services business borrows securities from the lending
client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent
borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending
client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the
transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we provide support to
the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a significant proportion of
the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the
ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have
designated us as an eligible borrower.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending
activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards,
interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or prime services businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity
and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2: Total Revenue,
increased 2% and was flat in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022. The increase in the
three month period of 2023 relative to the prior year period was primarily driven by
higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our
structured products business.
Front office software and data revenue, which primarily includes revenue from
CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, increased 2% and 3% in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the
same periods of 2022, primarily due to higher software-enabled and professional
services revenue, partially offset by lower on-premises renewals.
Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily
driven by the sale of
term software licenses and SaaS, including professional services such as consulting
and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Approximately
50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed on-premises
is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to
and use of the software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of
the contract and other contractual terms. The remainder of revenue for on-premise
installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other
services are provided. Upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same
pattern of revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal
and the remaining balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a
SaaS related arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the
software, is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon
renewal of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services
are provided under the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions
of CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other
business units quarter to quarter.
Lending related and other fees increased 2% in the three months ended
September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by
insurance related software products. Lending related and other fees decreased 5%
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of
2022, primarily driven by the municipal finance and stable value wrap businesses.
Lending related and other fees primarily consists of fee revenue associated with our
fund finance, leverage loans, municipal finance, insurance and stable value wrap
businesses.
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated
with other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue increased $49 million and $166 million in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of
2022, primarily due to a previously disclosed tax credit investment accounting
change and smaller negative market-related adjustments. For the nine month
period, the increases were partially offset by lower positive fair value adjustments on
equity investments.
For further information on the tax credit investment accounting change, please
refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to
the same periods of 2022.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less
interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets,
which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with
banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by
client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total
interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average
interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned
from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to an
FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.
NII decreased 5% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared
to the same period of 2022, primarily due to lower average deposit balances and
deposit mix shift towards interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by the impact of
higher interest rates. NII increased 19% in the nine months ended September 30,
2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates,
partially offset by lower average client deposit balances.
Investment securities' net purchase premium amortization, which is included in
interest income, was nil and $25 million in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $46 million and $199 million in the
same periods of 2022, respectively.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated
statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the
security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as
purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for
prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities net premium
amortization (discount accretion) for the periods indicated:

Excluding the impact of
netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.19% and 0.22% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 0.31% and 0.21% in the same periods of 2022, respectively.

Excluding the impact of netting, the
average interest rates would be approximately 5.16% and 4.81% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 2.04% and 0.93% in the same periods of 2022, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the
components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $222.49 billion and $230.61 billion
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to
$235.91 billion and $248.34 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively. The
decrease is primarily due to lower client deposit balances.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $62.51 billion and $69.55 billion
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to
$68.92 billion and $74.03 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively. These
deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve,
the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks. The lower levels of average cash
balances reflect lower levels of client deposits.
Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $1.64 billion in both
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $1.47 billion
and $2.21 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively. As a member of FICC,
we may net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased
under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing
organization, when specific netting criteria are met. The impact of balance sheet
netting was $137.77 billion and $131.40 billion on average in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $72.74 billion and
$66.35 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively, primarily driven by an
increase in FICC repo volumes.
We are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a sponsoring member
within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities
with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC
Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We
may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC,
backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance
of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. We generally obtain a
security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral
that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may be required to pay a pro rata share
of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event
of the default of another member to the
extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss
allocation to FICC is depleted. It is difficult to estimate our maximum possible
exposure under the membership agreement, since this would require an
assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet
occurred. We did not record any liabilities under these arrangements as of both
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Average investment securities decreased to $105.00 billion and $106.54 billion
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, from
$108.88 billion and $113.99 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively. The
portfolio declined across most major asset classes, which was primarily driven by a
smaller balance sheet from lower client deposits amidst a higher level of market
rates.
Average loans decreased to $34.53 billion and $34.10 billion in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $35.07 billion
and $35.10 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively, due to lower average
overdrafts. Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts, averaged $31.25 billion
and $30.25 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively, compared to $29.31 billion and $29.14 billion in the same periods of
2022, respectively. Additional information about these loans is provided in Note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our prime
services business, decreased to $18.09 billion in both the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively, from $20.88 billion and $22.27 billion in
the same periods of 2022, respectively, primarily driven by a decrease in the level of
cash collateral posted. Other interest-earning assets primarily reflects prime
services assets where cash has been posted to borrow securities from lenders,
which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. This cash includes both cash
from borrowers and cash utilized from our balance sheet, and is presented on a net
basis on the balance sheet where we have enforceable netting agreements. Noninterest earning assets also includes a portion of our prime services assets where
borrower-provided non-cash collateral has been utilized to borrow securities from
lenders, which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. In addition, we also
use securities within our investment portfolio to borrow securities from lenders,
which we subsequently loan, as principal, to our borrowers; in this structure our
investment portfolio securities are encumbered, but this is not reflected on the
balance sheet. Combined with our prime services liabilities,
State Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
revenue from these activities generates securities finance fee revenue as well as
net interest income.
Average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $169.15 billion and
decreased to $171.53 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, respectively, from $166.84 billion and $175.87 billion in the same periods of
2022, respectively. The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2023,
relative to the prior year, was driven by our focus on deposit-raising initiatives and
rotation from non-interest bearing deposits, partially offset by the higher market
interest rate environment across most major currencies and the impact of
quantitative tightening. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying
asset servicing business, client behavior, the mix of interest-bearing and noninterest bearing deposits and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S.
and non-U.S. interest rates.
Average short-term borrowings decreased to $0.32 billion and increased to
$1.15 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively,
from $0.43 billion and $0.66 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively.
Average long-term debt was $18.12 billion and $16.91 billion in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $13.96 billion
and $13.97 billion in the same periods of 2022, respectively. These amounts reflect
issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with our prime
services business, were $4.27 billion and $3.65 billion in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $2.54 billion and $2.64 billion
in the same periods of 2022, respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities is
primarily driven by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a
net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest bearing
liabilities also include a portion of our prime services liabilities where client provided
non-cash collateral has been received and we have rehypothecation rights.
Securities received as collateral from our custody clients where we have no
rehypothecation rights are used as a credit mitigant only and remain off balance
sheet.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume
and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet
management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations
of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to
the yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and
amount of credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,
we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities
of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal
agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.
The pace at which we reinvest, and the types of investment securities purchased,
will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our
reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
We recorded no provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2023, as an
increase in reserves for commercial real estate loans was offset by a reduction in
reserves related to leveraged loans. There was no provision for credit losses
recorded in the third quarter of 2022. In the nine months ended September 30,
2023, we recorded a $26 million provision for credit losses, compared to $10 million
in the same period of 2022, primarily driven by an increase in loan loss reserves
associated with credit portfolio rating changes.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial Condition" in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.

Expenses
Table 15: Expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods of 2022. Total
expenses increased 3% in both the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, compared to the same periods of 2022, primarily reflecting higher salaries
and continued business investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the
absence of acquisition and restructuring costs incurred in the third quarter of 2022.

Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 4% in the three
months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, mainly
due to higher salaries, headcount and the impact of currency translation, partially
offset by lower performance-based incentive compensation and contractor spend.
Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 5% in the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to
higher salaries and headcount, partially offset by lower contractor spend and
seasonal expenses.
Total headcount increased 2% as of September 30, 2023 compared to
September 30, 2022, primarily driven by operational support for new business
growth segments, as well as technology investments and in-sourcing.
Information systems and communications expenses increased 3% and 1% in
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to
the same periods of 2022. The increase in the three month period of 2023 relative to
the prior year period is primarily due to higher technology and infrastructure
investments, partially offset by optimization savings, insourcing and vendor savings
initiatives.
Transaction processing services expenses increased 6% in the three months
ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily due to
higher sub-custody costs. Transaction processing services expenses decreased 2%
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of
2022, primarily due to lower sub-custody costs and broker fees.
Occupancy expenses increased 4% and 3% in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022,
primarily due to increased real estate costs.
Amortization of other intangible assets increased 3% and 1% in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same
periods of 2022.
Other expenses increased 4% and 8% in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022, largely
reflecting higher marketing expenses and professional fees.
Acquisition and Restructuring Costs
We had no acquisition and restructuring costs in both the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $13 million and $34 million in the
same periods of 2022, respectively, related to the BBH Investor Services acquisition
transaction that we are no longer pursuing.

Income tax expense was $89 million and $381 million in the three and nine

17.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 18.7% in the
same period of 2022, primarily due to the impact of the investment portfolio
repositioning. Our effective tax rate was 18.0% in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, compared to 16.3% in the same period in 2022, primarily due
to the impact of the tax credit investment accounting change. For further information

Servicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 17: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same
period of 2022, primarily driven by higher average equity market levels, net new business and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower client activity and
adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees decreased 4% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, primarily driven by
lower average fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average equity market levels and net new
business.
For additional information about servicing fees and the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing
fee revenue, refer to "Fee Revenue" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 2% and 3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022,
as higher salaries, headcount and continued business investments were partially offset by productivity and optimization savings. Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense
and payroll taxes were $132 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $143 million in the same period of 2022. Additional information about expenses is
provided under "Expenses" in "Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Investment Management total revenue increased 9% and 3% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022.
Management Fees
Management fees increased 1% in the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same period of 2022, as higher average equity market levels were partially
offset by a previously disclosed shift of certain management fees into NII. Management fees decreased 6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the same
period of 2022, primarily due to the aforementioned shift of certain management fees into NII, client insourcing and cumulative net outflows since September 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by
the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management
lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine
balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their
worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and
short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities
are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are
denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and
repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment
alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than
our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek
to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational
in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our
assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and shortduration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and
securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is
determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a
well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio taking into consideration the
interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of
the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of
the global interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified, high-credit
quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the
management of our consolidated statement of condition.
Average duration of our investment securities portfolio, including the impact of
hedges, was 2.7 years and 2.6 years as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively.
Approximately 97% and 95% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated
“AA” or higher as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as follows:

The portfolios are also diversified geographically, with the states that represent our
largest exposures widely dispersed across the U.S.

credit losses on debt securities and impairment of AFS securities is

Fund finance loans include primarily $9.33 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $5.97 billion loans to real money
funds and $1.19 billion loans to business development companies as of September 30, 2023, compared to $7.57 billion private
equity capital call finance loans, $6.61 billion loans to real money funds and $1.11 billion loans to business development
companies as of December 31, 2022.
Includes $1.93 billion securities finance loans, $276 million loans to municipalities and $6 million other loans as of
September 30, 2023 and $1.51 billion securities finance loans, $321 million loans to municipalities and $42 million other loans as
of December 31, 2022.
As of September 30, 2023, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $28.85 billion and fixed rate loans totaled
$2.99 billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with EURIBOR
indexed floating-rate loans. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional details.
The increase in domestic loans was primarily driven by an increase in fund
finance loans and other loans, partially offset by lower overdrafts, and the increase
in foreign loans was primarily driven by fund finance loans, overdrafts and
collateralized loan obligations in loan form as of September 30, 2023 compared to
December 31, 2022.
As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our leveraged loans
totaled approximately $3.43 billion and $3.55 billion, respectively. We sold
$74 million of leveraged loans in the third quarter of 2023.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022 of $231 million and $98 million, respectively, to participate
in syndications of leveraged loans. Additional information about these

unfunded commitments is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our
internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with
approximately 92% and 96% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of September 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our investment strategy involves
generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major
global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each
potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry
segment. However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to
higher-rated loans in our portfolio.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying
classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form

Provision for credit losses (funded commitments) 35 14
Provisions for credit losses (unfunded commitments) (9) (4)
Charge-offs (13) (4)
Ending balance $ 134 $ 114
The provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial and financial loans.
The charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans.
As of September 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses increased
$13 million compared to December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting a provision for
credit losses of $26 million driven by an increase in loan loss reserves associated
with credit portfolio rating changes, partially offset by charge-offs of $13 million.
As of September 30, 2023, approximately $72 million of our allowance for
credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and
financial segment compared to $75 million as of September 30, 2022. The
remaining $62 million and $39 million as of September 30, 2023 and September 30,
2022, respectively, was related to commercial real estate loans, other loans, offbalance sheet commitments, interest-bearing deposits with banks and other
financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities. As of
September 30, 2023, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.3% of total
loans.
Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses is
provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of
risks, some that are inherent in the financial services industry, and others that are
more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses
on material risks, which include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risks, including funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• operational resiliency risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, referred to as asset
and liability management, consisting primarily of interest rate risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of them, could
affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, and are discussed
in detail on pages 23 to 52 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2022 Form
10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 81 to
86 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading
activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal
securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk
(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
State Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the
form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private
sector institutions and fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet
credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and
letters of credit. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit
losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based,
among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the
estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple
economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to
develop our forecast of expected losses.
In the third quarter of 2023, the allowance estimate reflected an upward shift in
management's economic outlook and positive changes in the leveraged loan
portfolio which was offset by an increase in reserves for the commercial real estate
loan portfolio. Allowance estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those
inherent in our model and economic assumptions, and management may use
qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts
utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2023 or if
credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of
the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management framework,
including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,
risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring
and controls, refer to pages 86 to 91 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity
based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing
liquidity risk, we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning
indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This
process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios
which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential
increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the
potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well as on a standalone basis at our Parent Company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of
State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding
sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market, the Federal Reserve's
discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.
Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily
through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support
agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash and equivalents intended to meet its current
debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as those projected over the next
twelve-month period. Reference our SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of
Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial
distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be
available to the Parent Company. As of September 30, 2023, our Parent Company
and State Street Bank had approximately $1.00 billion of senior notes or
subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management
activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including
interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international
regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance,
supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some
cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII
or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the
way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative
regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a
non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our
efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics, refer to
State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
pages 91 to 96 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk Management, in our
2022 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity ratios, including LCR and
the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 15 included under Item 1, Business, in our
2022 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to
improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid
securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. Net cash outflows are
measured as prescribed under the LCR rule which provides a significant benefit for
deposits classified as operational. We report the LCR to the Federal Reserve daily.
For the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, average daily
LCR for the Parent Company was 109% and 106%, respectively. The impact of
higher deposits on the Parent Company's LCR is limited by a cap, known as the
transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street Bank that can be
recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule. This
restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to
the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street
Bank). The average HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the Parent Company under
the LCR final rule definition was $119.56 billion for the quarter ended September 30,
2023 compared to $139.88 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022,
primarily due to a decrease in client deposits relative to the prior period. For the
quarter ended September 30, 2023, the LCR for State Street Bank was
approximately 120%.
In addition, we are subject to the final rule issued by the U.S. banking agencies
implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS's) NSFR in the
U.S. which became effective on July 1, 2021. The final rule requires large banking
organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted
measure of a company’s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated
by applying standardized weightings to the company’s equity and liabilities
based on their expected stability. The amount of stable funding can be no less than
the amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized
weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their
liquidity characteristics. As a U.S. GSIB, we are required to maintain an NSFR that
is equal to or greater than 100%. Pursuant to the BCBS's NSFR final rule, as a
subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB, State Street Bank is similarly required to maintain an
NSFR that is equal to or greater than 100%. As of September 30, 2023, both the
Parent Company's and State Street Bank's NSFR was above the 100% minimum
NSFR requirement.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements
governing deposits with the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central
banks of approximately $59.70 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023,
compared to $79.52 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The lower
levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of client
deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without
corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the
FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the
FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against
high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. We had
no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB as of September 30, 2023 and had
$2.0 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2022.
Access to primary, intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is
an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying
conditions. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had no
outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other
central bank facility.
In addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity, we have
other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as
collateral to access these various facilities. These additional assets are available
sources of liquidity and not included in our LCR asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $76.55 billion for
the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to $78.25 billion for the quarter
ended December 31, 2022.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of
client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to
clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan
portfolios; or
State Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress
conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of our liquidity
involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to
financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our prime services
program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $34.15 billion and $31.20 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $1.53 billion and $2.13 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of
September 30, 2023, approximately 76% of our unfunded commitments to extend
credit and 43% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of
our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the
gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash
requirements.
Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit a
resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution
strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute
on that strategy in the event of major financial distress. Through resolution planning,
we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial
system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019 requires
a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the
relevant submission years. We submitted our updated 2023 165(d) resolution plan
by July 1, 2023. Under the 165(d) rule, results are due from the Agencies by July 1,
2024, unless the deadline is extended due to extenuating circumstances. Our next
165(d) resolution plan submission to the Agencies is due by July 1, 2025.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred resolution strategy is
the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the
Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company,
SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as
defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available
resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other
entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State
Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary
Entities
from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the recapitalization
of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would
enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The
Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly
organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the
Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by
contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,
investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other
cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the
support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent
available, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has
agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the
Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent
Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations
and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has
provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may
issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue
to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a
"Recapitalization Event", which is defined under the support agreement as the
earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being
breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for
the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and
SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be
exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement
that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to
fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF
is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent
Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis, the capital and
State Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary Entities. To support
this process, we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that
would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events
tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds are set at levels intended
to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly
resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging
from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement, (which specifically
exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential
bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to
the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and
(4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a
Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support
agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective
or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our
entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. We submitted our last
IDI plan before July 1, 2018. In November 2018, the FDIC had announced that until
the FDIC completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would be
required to be filed. On June 25, 2021, the FDIC issued a policy statement on
resolution plans for IDIs that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the
frequency of submissions to a three-year cycle. State Street Bank’s next IDI plan
submission deadline is December 1, 2023.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan to the Federal Reserve.
This plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be
implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress. We also
have recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we
operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody, accounting,
administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset
management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of
these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally
provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place
deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of September 30, 2023,
approximately 70% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S.
dollars, 15% in EUR, 5% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies. As of
December 31, 2022, approximately 65% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other
currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of
the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by
pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset
Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of
liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold
under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature,
generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.
These balances were $3.10 billion and $1.18 billion as of September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively.
State Street Bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial
institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.04 billion as of September 30,
2023, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit
has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. As
of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was no balance
outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business
needs.
On August 3, 2023, we issued $1.2 billion
State Street Corporation | 35
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
aggregate principal amount of 5.272% fixed rate senior notes due 2026 and $300
million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2026.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the
maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating
agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client
deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer
products;
• facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
A downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which
could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and
large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under
securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force
terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral
agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate
the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of
these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by major rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination
payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that
could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit
ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the
consolidated
financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as secured
financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit
triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Volatility in the global equity and fixed income markets, and heightened
geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas
war, may result in stress on the operating environment and increasing operational
risk. Both conflicts heighten information technology risk exposures, including cyberthreats. See also “Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages
97 to 100 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in
our 2022 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information
technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology noncompliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents,
business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology
operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 100 to 101 included under Item 7, Management's

Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability
management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is
provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk
associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate
risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of
which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity
needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against
those factors.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into
derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign
exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward
contracts and interest rate futures. As of September 30, 2023, the notional amount
of these derivative contracts was $2.43 trillion, of which $2.39 trillion was composed
of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions
closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All
foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities, refer to pages 101 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Market
Risk Management" in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,
which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical
confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR,
and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk
requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a
one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to
calculate VaR, but
with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model is
designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous
one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR meets the regulatory
requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of
other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. For each
portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year
time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the
available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008,
the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the
Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the
historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future
market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and
methodologies, refer to pages 103 to 108 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Valueat-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates
techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario
of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of
risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We
conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events
that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our
current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress
testing as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted,
analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level
(for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Credit and Market Risk
Committee (CMRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in
conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the
CMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that
prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.

Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of
estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which
excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions,
changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity. We had no back-testing exceptions in the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, and one back-testing exception in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. At
a 99% confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).
The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended September 30, 2023, June 30,
2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the
sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

The three month average of our total stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $40 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to an average of
approximately $37 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and $28 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The slight increase in the average total stressed VaR for
the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, is primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our
trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction
in VaR measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,
and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate
risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and
liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic
value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits
generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio
positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our
baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 30, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts
at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Our baseline rate forecast as of September 30, 2023 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at
that point in time, which implied that rates have reached peak levels and rate cuts will begin around the middle of 2024.

In Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous 100 basis point shocks to various tenors on
the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the
adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment
assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance
rotation, including reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. The results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated for other (e.g., more severe) shocks as the impact
of interest rate shocks may not be linear. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.

The short-end is 0-3 months. The long-end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.
Our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an NII benefit in higher rate scenarios. However, our USD balance sheet is liability
sensitive driven by rising deposit betas resulting in an NII exposure to higher rate scenarios. As of September 30, 2023, USD NII benefits from lower rate scenarios and is exposed to
higher rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve. Compared to September 30, 2022, our USD NII positioning is modestly less liability sensitive
driven by investment portfolio and hedging activities, partially offset by the impacts from rising deposit betas and deposit reductions. As of September 30, 2023, non-USD NII benefits
from higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve. Compared to September 30, 2022, our non-USD NII
positioning is less asset sensitive driven by rising deposit betas and deposit reductions. USD and non-USD NII sensitivities are also impacted by routine currency-level baseline
forecasting update and refinements, including deposit betas.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry,
with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support
numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models
contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial
management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model
results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect
on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework
seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management framework,
including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 109 to 110 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or
capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of
strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic
risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market
performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary
impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit,
operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our
assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.
Management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our
business.
Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational
and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of
an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an
operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the
potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as
a strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a
major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired
business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue,
would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
Strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for its
assessment and management include the development of business plans, which
are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the Board of
Directors, as well as a
formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals.
The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify
with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility,
scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the
potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and control of
strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight
from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk
management processes.
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial
flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own
internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by
banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge
above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all
other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to
the required minimum of 3.0% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any
regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and
discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or
financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be
subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 110 to 117 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market
risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators.
The Basel III rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy:
the “standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches",
State Street Corporation | 41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The
standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA,
including specified risk weights for on and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The
advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach
used for the calculation of credit risk RWA, and the Advanced Measurement
Approach used for the calculation of operational risk RWA.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, we and State Street Bank, as advanced
approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to
as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy,
such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the
lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized
approach. Under the advanced approaches, State Street and State Street Bank are
subject to a 2.5% CCB requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital
buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. Under the standardized approach,
State Street Bank is subject to the same CCB and countercyclical capital buffer
requirements, but for State Street, the 2.5% CCB requirement is replaced by the
SCB requirement according to the SCB rule issued in 2020. In addition, State Street
is subject to a G-SIB surcharge.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB with a buffer
calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected
CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock
dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh
quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than
2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a
banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments to executive officers.
Our current SCB requirement for the period from October 1, 2022 through
September 30, 2023 was 2.5%. On June 28, 2023, we were notified by the Federal
Reserve of the results from the 2023 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated
under the 2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting
in an SCB at that floor, which will go into effect starting October 1, 2023 and will run
through September 30, 2024.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2023, include a CCB of
2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach,
respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This
results in minimum risk-based ratios of
8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital
ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2023, is 1.0%. Based on
a calculation date of December 31, 2022, our G-SIB surcharge will be 1.0% through
December 31, 2024.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company,
we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required, among other
requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily
measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading
positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR
measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public
disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market
risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR
measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is
provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement
the Basel III endgame agreement for large banks, and a separate proposed rule
related to the risk-based capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs. The Basel III endgame
proposed rule would, among other things, eliminate the advanced approaches for
monitoring capital adequacy in favor of a new standardized expanded risk-based
approach (including with respect to operational risk), while also replacing the
existing market risk capital framework with the new fundamental review of the
trading book methodology. The G-SIB surcharge proposed rule would, among other
things, measure the G-SIB surcharge in more granular 0.1% increments as opposed
to the 0.5% increments which currently apply. On October 20, 2023, the banking
agencies extended the comment period for each of the proposed rules to January
16, 2024, from November 30, 2023.
For additional information about our regulatory capital, refer to pages 110 to
117 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2022 Form 10-K.
The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related
regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. We
are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the
standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the

Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include AOCI hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit riskbased deductions.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial
condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory
review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 28, 2023, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2023
supervisory stress test. Our preliminary SCB calculated under the 2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will be in effect from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our CET1 capital decreased $1.54 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to common share repurchases and dividends declared in
the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by net income. Our Tier 1 capital decreased $1.54 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under both the
advanced approaches and standardized approach, due to the decrease in CET1 capital.
Our Tier 2 capital remained flat as of September 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach.
Our total capital decreased by $1.54 billion and $1.53 billion as of September 30, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, under the advanced approaches and standardized
approach, respectively, primarily due to the decrease in CET1 capital.

 Not applicable
As of September 30, 2023, total advanced approaches RWA increased $1.49 billion compared to December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in credit risk RWA. The
increase in credit risk RWA primarily reflects higher loan balances, increased derivative and reverse repurchase transaction volumes, higher equity market levels, partially offset by
lower investment securities.
As of September 30, 2023, total standardized approach RWA increased $10.78 billion compared to December 31, 2022, mainly due to an increase in credit risk RWA. The
increase in credit risk RWA primarily reflects higher derivatives RWA driven by volatility, higher loans RWA related to new capital call commitments, higher reverse repurchase
transactions RWA driven by increased volume and higher equity market levels, partially offset by lower investment securities RWA due to the impact of the investment portfolio
repositioning.
The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2023, presented in Table 32: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the
advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with
respect to our capital and related matters as of September 30, 2023, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and
assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-
Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may
not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events
experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing
regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a
material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.
An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the
severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation
to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us
or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will
change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III
final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The Tier 1
leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance
sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the
denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet
assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

The SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well
capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0%
to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject
to a well capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company
requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, is intended to improve the
resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced
prudential standards, and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD)
and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
External TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a GSIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable countercyclical

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 56 to 58 in "Related
Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and pages 165 to 167
in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof,
are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market purchases, accelerated share
repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction
may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our
financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock
issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our
clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of
these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $269.18 billion and
$348.92 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market
value of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to
the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $281.86 billion and $366.90 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we
indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100%
of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. Of the collateral of $281.86 billion and $366.90 billion, referenced above, $58.72 billion and $54.11 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements
as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We or our agents held $63.26 billion and $57.90 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase
agreements as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements

OTHER MATTERS
Closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and Related FDIC Matters
On March 12 and 13, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank and the appointment of the FDIC as the receiver for those banks, the FDIC
announced that, under the systemic risk exception set forth in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), all insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the
respective bridge banks for SVB and Signature Bank.
The FDIC also announced that, as required by the FDIA, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a special
assessment. On May 22, 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would impose special assessments to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the
protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on March 12, 2023, , as required by the FDIA. The assessment base for the special
assessment would be equal to an insured depository institution’s (IDI) estimated uninsured deposits, reported as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in
estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for IDIs that are part of a holding company with one or more subsidiary IDIs, at the banking organization level. The FDIC has proposed
to collect a special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods, which it estimates will result in total revenue of $15.8
billion. Because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC would retain the ability to cease collection early, extend the
special assessment collection period one or more quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period to collect the difference between actual or estimated losses and the
amounts collected, or impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis after the receiverships for SVB and Signature Bank terminate. The FDIC is proposing an
effective date of January 1, 2024, with special assessments collected beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024, with an
invoice payment date of June 28, 2024).
We presently estimate, based on the FDIC’s May 2023 proposed rule, that the total pre-tax amount of State Street Bank’s special assessment will be approximately $360
million, although the timing, amount and allocation of that special assessment remains subject to the provisions of the FDIC’s final rule, when effective, as well as any actions by the
FDIC, as described above, to cease collection early, extend the collection period, or impose a final shortfall special assessment. The special assessment is expected to be
recognized, in full, in the reporting period in which the final rule is published.
