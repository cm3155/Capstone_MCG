MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation is one of the world’s largest providers of financial
services to institutional investors. Our clients - asset managers and owners,
insurance companies, official institutions, and central banks - rely on us to deliver
solutions that support their goals across the investment life cycle.
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial
strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal
banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State
Street Bank, we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including
in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We
provide a broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors
worldwide, with $46.76 trillion of AUC/A and $4.73 trillion of AUM as of
September 30, 2024.
As of September 30, 2024, we had consolidated total assets of $338.48 billion,
consolidated total deposits of $247.43 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $25.83 billion and approximately 53,000 employees.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in "Line of
Business Information" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Form 10-Q).
Our executive offices are located at One Congress Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02114 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Form 10-Q,
unless the context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our"
or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of this Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2023 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 previously filed with the SEC
(2023 Form 10-K). The financial information contained in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with the financial and other
information contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts
presented in this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period
presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of
certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex, about matters
that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
• Recurring fair value measurements;
• Allowance for credit losses;
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• Contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex
judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision
as new information becomes available. For additional information about these
significant accounting policies refer to pages 122 to 124, “Significant Accounting
Estimates” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K. We did not
change these significant accounting policies in the first nine months of 2024.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, is presented using both a U.S. GAAP, or
reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used
in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain
financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management
uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to,
financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP
financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently
applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. As part of our non-GAAPbasis measures, we present a fully

taxable-equivalent NII that reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income
associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent
basis, which we believe facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our
underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory
standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with
respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading
activities), the LCR and NSFR, summary results of annual State Street-run stress
tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and recovery and resolution plan
disclosures. These additional disclosures are accessible on the "Filings & reports"
tab of our website at investors.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual
reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and
abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us under
the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other public
statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in our
Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as applicable) that
are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. securities
laws, including statements about our goals and expectations regarding our
business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, cost
savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, climate,
dividend and stock purchase programs, acquisitions, outcomes of legal
proceedings, market growth, joint ventures and divestitures, client growth, new
technologies, services and opportunities, sustainability and impact, human capital,
as well as industry, governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends,
initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do
not relate strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “expect,” “outlook,” “will,” “goal,” “target,” “strategy,” “may,”
“estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “objective,” “forecast,” “believe,” “priority,” “anticipate,”
“seek,” and “trend,” or similar statements or variations of such terms, are intended to
identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements
contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
which change over time, are based on management's expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future
results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of
the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of
factors affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the
equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to
State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could
cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking
statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty. Important factors that in the
future could cause actual results to differ materially from those envisaged in
forward-looking statements, and that in some cases have affected us in the past,
include, but are not limited to:
Strategic Risks
• We are subject to intense competition, which could negatively affect our
profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability in our financial
results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and services, including
State Street Alpha and those related to digital assets and artificial
intelligence, may impose costs on us, involve dependencies on third parties
and may expose us to increased operational, model and other risks;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and the
integration, retention and development of the benefits of these transactions,
including the consolidation of our operations joint ventures in India, pose
risks for our business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support
our business.
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by political, geopolitical, economic and
market conditions, including, for example, as a result of liquidity or capital
deficiencies (actual or perceived) by other financial institutions and related
market and government actions, the ongoing wars in Ukraine and in the
Middle East, major political elections globally, actions taken by central
banks to address inflationary and growth pressures, monetary policy
tightening, periods of significant volatility in valuations

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
and liquidity or other disruptions in the markets for equity, fixed income and
other assets classes globally or within specific markets;
• We have significant global operations and clients that can be adversely
impacted by disruptions in key global economies, including local, regional
and geopolitical developments affecting those economies;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and
consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes
in the financial markets, governmental action or monetary policy. For
example, among other risks, increases in prevailing interest rates or market
conditions have led, and were they to occur in the future could further lead,
to reduced levels of client deposits and resulting decreases in our NII or to
portfolio management decisions resulting in reductions in our capital or
liquidity ratios;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk of counterparties, who may also have
substantial financial dependencies on other financial institutions, and these
credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our revenue and is
subject to decline based on, among other factors, market and currency
declines, investment activities and preferences of our clients and their
business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, our financial
condition, capital ratios, results of operations and business prospects could
be adversely affected;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios depend on
data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are
subject to change, which could materially impact our risk exposures, our
total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not
be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an actual or
perceived reduction in our financial strength, our borrowing and
capital costs, liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common share
repurchases, may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and
considerations, including capital, credit and liquidity;
• We face extensive and changing government regulation and supervision in
the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and
compliance risks and may affect our business activities and strategies;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and
litigation;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased and conflicting
political and regulatory scrutiny of asset management stewardship and
corporate sustainability or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
practices;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have
an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory
actions, litigation and other adverse effects;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated
results of operations and financial condition;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions
and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our
effective tax rate;
• We could face liabilities for withholding and other non-income taxes,
including in connection with our services to clients, as a result of tax
authority examinations; and
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other
reputational harm.
Operational and Technology Risks
Our internal control environment may be inadequate, fail or be circumvented,
and actual results may differ from those expressed as a result of a number of
factors, including the manifestation of operational risk as follows:
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and
maintain our technology infrastructure, or otherwise meet the increasing
resiliency expectations of our clients and regulators, or as a result of a
cyber-attack or similar vulnerability in our or business partners'
infrastructure;
State Street Corporation | 6
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
• Our risk management framework, models and processes may not be
effective in identifying or mitigating risk and reducing the potential for related
losses, and a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or
errors or delays in our operational and transaction processing, or those of
third parties, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, operating results and reputation;
• Shifting and maintaining operational activities to non-U.S. jurisdictions,
changing our operating model, including by consolidating our operations
joint ventures in India, and outsourcing to, or insourcing from, third parties
expose us to increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and reputational
harm and may not result in expected cost savings or operational
improvements;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our or our business partners' or clients'
information technology systems or facilities, such as cyber-attacks or other
disruptions to our or their operations, could result in significant costs,
reputational damage and impacts on our business activities;
• Long-term contracts and customizing service delivery for clients expose us
to increased operational risk, pricing and performance risk;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or may infringe upon
the rights of third parties;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors
that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating
results and regulatory compliance;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if investors in the
collective investment pools we sponsor or manage incur substantial losses
in these investment pools or are restricted in redeeming their interests in
these investment pools;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses, and disclosure
requirements related to such risks, could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses or face negative impacts on our business as a result of
unforeseen events, including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, climate
change, pandemics, global conflicts, an abrupt banking crisis and other
geopolitical events, which may have a negative impact on our business and
operations.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our
forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the
factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or disclosed in our
other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should not be
relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any time
subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no
obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made.
The factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all
risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all
developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions and should
not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in
State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings,
including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our
annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act
of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the
"Filings & reports" tab of our website at investors.statestreet.com.

The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section provides information
related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial
results for the third quarter of 2024 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial
Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including
the comparison of our financial results for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023, is provided under
“Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line of Business Information" and "Capital"
which follows these sections, as well as in our consolidated financial statements in
this Form 10-Q.
Financial Results and Highlights
Third quarter of 2024 financial performance
• Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.26 in the third quarter of 2024 increased
81% as compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to the impact of
a notable item in the prior year period and higher total revenue, partially
offset by higher total expenses. The prior year notable item represented
64% points of the increase.
• Total revenue increased 21% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, primarily driven by the impact of a notable item in the
prior year period and higher fee revenue and NII. The prior year notable
item represented 12% points of the increase.
• Total expenses increased 6% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, as higher business investments, as well as revenue
and performance-related costs, were partially offset by productivity savings
from ongoing organizational simplification, process improvements and other
initiatives, including from the joint venture consolidations in India.
• Pre-tax margin of 28.4% in the third quarter of 2024 increased from 19.0%
in the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher total revenue, partially
offset by higher expenses and provision for credit losses. Return on equity
was 12.0% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase from 7.3% in the same
period of 2023, primarily due to higher net income available to common
shareholders, partially offset by higher average common shareholders'
equity.
• Operating leverage was 15.2% points in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting
the impact of a notable item in third quarter of 2023 which represented
11.9% points of operating leverage. Operating leverage represents the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
difference between the percentage change in total revenue and the
percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the same
period of the prior year.
• Fee operating leverage was 4.9% points in the third quarter of 2024,
reflecting the impact of notable items which represented 3.4% points of fee
operating leverage. Fee operating leverage represents the difference
between the percentage change in total fee revenue and the percentage
change in total expenses, in each case relative to the same period of the
prior year.
• We returned a total of $674 million to our shareholders in the form of
common share repurchases and common stock dividends.
Notable Items
• Notable items in the third quarter of 2024 include:
◦ Loss on the sale of investment securities of approximately $81
million relating to an investment portfolio repositioning reflected in
other income;
◦ Gain on sale of an equity investment of $66 million recorded in
other fee revenue; and
◦ Revenue-related recovery of $15 million from settlement proceeds
associated with a 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is
reflected in foreign exchange trading services revenue.
• Notable items in the third quarter of 2023 included a loss on the sale of
investment securities of approximately $294 million relating to an
investment portfolio repositioning reflected in other income.
Revenue
• Total fee revenue increased 11% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to
the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting higher other fee revenue,
foreign exchange trading services revenue, management fees, and
servicing fees.
• Servicing fee revenue increased 3% in the third quarter of 2024, compared
to the same period of 2023, as higher average market levels and net new
business, excluding a previously disclosed client transition, were partially
offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition and
lower client activity, including asset mix shift.
• Management fee revenue increased 10% in the third quarter of 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher average
market levels.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue increased 19% in the third
quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to
higher client volumes and a $15 million revenue-related recovery from a
2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, partially offset by lower spreads
associated with lower average FX volatility. The $15 million revenue-related
recovery contributed 5% points to the increase.
• Securities finance revenue increased 13% in the third quarter of 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, mainly due to higher client lending
balances, partially offset by lower spreads primarily resulting from muted
industry specials activity.
• Software and processing fees revenue increased 11% in the third quarter of
2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher front
office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
• Other fee revenue increased $81 million in the third quarter of 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting a $66 million gain
on sale of an equity investment.
• NII increased 16% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same
period of 2023, primarily due to higher investment securities yields and loan
growth, partially offset by deposit mix shift towards interest-bearing
deposits.
• Other income was a loss of $80 million, mainly reflecting the loss on sale of
investment securities related to the repositioning of the investment portfolio.
Provision for Credit Losses
• In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a $26 million provision for credit
losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with
certain commercial real estate and leveraged loans, combined with a
change in macroeconomic factors. There was no provision for credit losses
recorded in the third quarter of 2023.
Expenses
• Total expenses increased 6% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, as higher business investments, as well as revenue
and performance-related costs, were partially

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
offset by productivity savings from ongoing organizational simplification,
process improvements and other initiatives, including from the joint venture
consolidations in India.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $46.76 trillion as of September 30, 2024, increased 17%
compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher quarter-end
market levels, net new business and client flows. In the third quarter of
2024, newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately
$466 billion of AUC/A. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future
periods totaled approximately $2.35 trillion of AUC/A as of September 30,
2024.
• AUM of $4.7 trillion as of September 30, 2024, increased 29% compared to
September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher quarter-end market levels and
higher net inflows in the third quarter of 2024.
Capital
• In the third quarter of 2024, we returned a total of $674 million to our
shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and common stock
dividends.
◦ We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.76 per
share, totaling $224 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to
$0.69 per share, totaling $213 million in the same period of 2023,
representing an increase of approximately 10% on a per share
basis.
◦ In the third quarter of 2024, we acquired an aggregate of 5.4 million
shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $84.00
and an aggregate cost of $450 million. These purchases were all
conducted under the share repurchase program approved by our
Board of Directors in January 2024.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio was 11.6% as of September 30, 2024,
flat compared to December 31, 2023, as capital generated from earnings
and improved AOCI was offset by the expected normalization of RWA. Our
Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.5% as of September 30, 2024, flat compared to
December 31, 2023, as capital generated from earnings and improved
AOCI was offset by higher consolidated average assets, primarily reflecting
higher client deposits and an increase in repo-style transactions. Given the
current global economic environment,
and our plans for capital distributions, we expect our CET1 capital ratio and
Tier 1 leverage ratio to remain within or above our target ranges of 10-11%
and 5.25-5.75%, respectively.
• On July 24, 2024, we issued 850 thousand depositary shares, each
representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of fixed rate reset, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series J, without par value per share,
with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000
per depositary share), in a public offering. The net proceeds from the
offering were approximately $842 million.
• On September 16, 2024, we redeemed an aggregate $500 million, or all
5,000 outstanding shares, of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock,
Series H (represented by 500,000 depository shares), for a cash
redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per
depository share), plus all declared and unpaid dividends.
Debt Issuances and Redemptions
• On August 20, 2024, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.530% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2029.
• On October 1, 2024, we notified the holders of our $1 billion aggregate
principal amount of 2.354% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025, that
we will redeem all the notes on November 1, 2024.
• On October 22, 2024, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.330% fixed rate senior notes due 2027, $300 million aggregate principal
amount of floating rate senior notes due 2027, and $800 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.675% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2032.

This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 and

Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Servicing and management fees
collectively made up approximately 69% and 70% of the total fee revenue in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 73% and 72%
of the total fee revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 3% in the
three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, as
higher average market levels and net new business, excluding a previously
disclosed client transition, were partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously
disclosed client transition and lower client activity, including asset mix shift.
Servicing fees increased 1% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% of total
servicing fees in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and
47% and 46% of total servicing fees in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, respectively.
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from a range of services provided to
our clients, including certain Alpha servicing mandates, consisting of core custody
services, accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to collectively as
back office and middle office services. The nature and mix of services provided and
the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees. The
basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. Generally, our servicing fee
revenues are affected by several factors, including changes in market valuations,
client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price
our services. For servicing fees for which we have not yet issued an invoice to our
clients as of period end, we include an estimate of the impact of changes in market
valuations, client activity and flows, net new business and changes in pricing in our
revenues.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic
and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a
corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though
the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes, and
geography of assets held within our clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes
where the valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or
where our valuation is dependent on third party information, AUC/A is reported on a
time lag, typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels
on our reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end market levels.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Over the five years ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately 2%
on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately 1% and (4)% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End
Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can
and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset
classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2024 that a 10%
increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a
corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain
constant and using relevant information as of September 30, 2024, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically
less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire
transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors,
including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five
years ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately (1)% on average with a range of
(3)% to 1% annually and approximately (3)% and 0% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market
trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2023, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on
average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 1% in both 2023 and 2022.
Gross investment servicing mandates were approximately $466 billion and $1.23 trillion of AUC/A in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and
approximately $1.80 trillion of AUC/A per year on average over the five years ended December 31, 2023, ranging from approximately $0.79 trillion to $3.52 trillion of AUC/A annually
in any given year.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of
assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from
6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past two full fiscal years. We expect that our more complex installations, including
new State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of the 6 to 36 months range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.35 trillion of
AUC/A that are yet to be installed as of September 30, 2024, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 24 months, with approximately 15-20% expected to be installed in
the remainder of 2024 and approximately 60% in 2025, with the balance expected to be installed largely in 2026. The expected timing of these installations is subject to change due
to a variety of factors, including adjusted implementation schedules agreed with clients, scope adjustments, and product and functionality changes.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no
assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A, once installed, can vary materially. On
average, over the five years ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (3)%
annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (4)% in any given year and approximately (2)% in both 2023 and 2022. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation
with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our
dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional
services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to
onboard those new services or process changes, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees
we negotiate when we win business from new clients.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes
in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another approximately 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the

volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 25% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
In addition to the effects described above (i.e., client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing) our servicing fee revenue in any period will vary depending on the
mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our
servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.

Consistent with past practice, AUC/A values for certain asset classes are based on a lag, typically one-month.
Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the third quarter of 2024 totaled approximately $466 billion of AUC/A. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods
totaled approximately $2.35 trillion as of September 30, 2024, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in
subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates, including Alpha servicing mandates, may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, consents or assignments, approval of applicable
boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals, the failure to complete any of which will prevent the relevant mandate from being installed and serviced. New asset
servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet
provided permission to publicly disclose. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in
servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods
may include assets associated with acquisitions or structured transactions and are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time we determine the
business to be won by us and are not updated based on subsequent developments, including changes in assets, market valuations, scope and, potentially, termination. Such assets
therefore do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which from time to time may be
significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping, transaction
processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as investment book of records,
transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX trading services,
liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis,
performance and attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and ESG investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary
based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the types of assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
As previously disclosed in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients is moving a significant portion of its ETF assets currently
with State Street to one or more other providers. Prior to the commencement of the transition of assets, which began in 2022, we estimated that the financial impact of this transition
represented approximately 1.9% of our 2021 total fee revenue. We began to see the impact of the transition on our fee revenue and income growth trends primarily towards the end
of 2023, with the remainder expected to be realized through 2025 as the transition continues. On a quarterly run rate basis, we estimate that the third quarter of 2024 reflected
approximately two-thirds of the revenue impact of the exiting business. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to
continue to be meaningful to our business.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees increased 10% and 11% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to
higher average market levels.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 24% and 25% of total management fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively, and 25% and 26% of total management fees in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets,
such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is
more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are
dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee
revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively
managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks
associated with the applicable account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2024, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business
won and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would
result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a
significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Quarter-end
indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant
indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total
Revenue, increased 19% and 9% in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to
higher client volumes and a $15 million revenue-related recovery from a 2018 FX
benchmark litigation resolution, partially offset by lower spreads associated with
lower average FX volatility. The $15 million revenue-related recovery contributed 5%
points and 2% points to the increase in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively.
Foreign exchange trading services revenue comprises revenue generated by
FX trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which
made up 62% and 38%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue
in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 63% and 37%, respectively, in the same
period of 2023.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker
through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with
clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly.
Clients are able to choose their own execution time and method, trading by
voice or electronically on one of the several available multibank platforms.
These principal market-making activities include transactions for funds
serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds
under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we
are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX
desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades
as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. Indirect FX is designed to
address FX trades that relate to the purchase, sale or holding of a security
where clients chose their execution frequency (either hourly or once per
day), allowing us to offer straight-through processing and a fully automated
service.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume
and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting
market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other
market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors
on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period. For example,
assuming all other factors remain constant, increases
or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in
increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX
transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading
to either direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to
one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a
principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and
automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as
well as those under custody at another bank.
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic
FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions
through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions generate
revenue through a “click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which
are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions
charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global
trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money
market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased
13% in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period
of 2023, mainly due to higher client lending balances, partially offset by lower
spreads primarily resulting from muted industry specials activity. Securities finance
revenue decreased 3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same period of 2023, due to lower spreads primarily resulting from muted
industry specials activity, partially offset by higher lending balances.
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds
State Street Corporation | 18
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the State
Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset
owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer
to as our prime services business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is
composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees
related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on
loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
As principal, our prime services business borrows securities from the lending
client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent
borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending
client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the
transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we provide support to
the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a significant proportion of
the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the
ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have
designated us as an eligible borrower.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending
activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards,
interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or prime services businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity
and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total
Revenue, increased 11% and 10% in the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily driven by
higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our
structured products business.
Front office software and data revenue, which primarily includes revenue from
CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, increased 12% and 10% in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the
same periods of 2023, primarily due to software-enabled revenue growth, partially
offset by lower on-premises renewals.
Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily
driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS, including professional
services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and
maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of
software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when the
customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the
percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms.
The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length
of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon renewal of an
on-premises software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed
with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the remaining balance recognized
over the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement, where the
customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of
the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of a SaaS arrangement,
revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new
contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are
accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to
quarter.
Lending related and other fees increased 7% and 8% in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of
2023, reflecting higher unfunded commitments primarily relating to our fund finance
products. Lending related and other fees primarily consists of fee revenue
associated with our fund finance, leverage loans, municipal finance, insurance and
stable value wrap businesses.
State Street Corporation | 19
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated
with other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue increased $81 million and $76 million in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of
2023, primarily reflecting a $66 million gain on sale of an equity investment.
Additional information about fee revenue is provided under "Line of Business
Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest
expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the
same periods of 2023.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest
expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets, which
principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks,
loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client
deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable-equivalent
(FTE) NII and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by
dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from
income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political
subdivisions), is adjusted to an FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory
income tax rates.
NII increased 16% and 4% in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher
investment securities yields and loan growth, partially offset by deposit mix shift
towards interest-bearing deposits.
Investment securities' net purchase discount accretion increased interest
income by $68 million and $154 million in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net purchase premium amortization
that reduced interest income by nil and $25 million in the same periods of 2023,
respectively. The change in the net purchase premium amortization (discount
accretion) was primarily driven by an increase in the net unamortized purchase
discounts on the non-MBS portfolio as of September 30, 2024, as compared to
September 30, 2023.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated
statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the
security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as
purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for
prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact MBS.
The following table presents the investment securities net premium
amortization (discount accretion) for the periods indicated:

Excluding the impact of netting, the average
interest rates would be approximately 5.15% and 5.21% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 5.16% and 4.81% in the same periods of 2023, respectively.

Average rates for total interest-bearing deposits excluding the impact of

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the
components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $269.51 billion and $261.89 billion
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
$222.49 billion and $230.61 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The
increase is primarily due to higher levels of client deposits and an increase in shortterm wholesale funding and long-term debt.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $86.88 billion and $88.33 billion
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
$62.51 billion and $69.55 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively. These
deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve,
the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks. The higher levels of average cash
balances reflect higher levels of client deposits and funding levels.
Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $6.99 billion and
$6.56 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
compared to $1.64 billion in both the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, due to a shift to term repurchase agreements, which reduces our ability to net
against resale agreement balances. Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may net
securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale
agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization,
when specific netting criteria are met. The impact of balance sheet netting was
$200.88 billion and $184.33 billion on average in the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $137.77 billion and $131.40 billion
in the same periods of 2023, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in FICC
repurchase agreement volumes.
We are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a sponsoring member
within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities
with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC
Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We
may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC,
backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance
of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. We generally obtain a
security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality
securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential
exposure to FICC.
Additionally, as a member of certain industry clearing and settlement
exchanges, we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by
the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another
member to the extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the
prescribed loss allocation to FICC is depleted. It is difficult to estimate our maximum
possible exposure under the membership agreement, since this would require an
assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet
occurred. We did not record any liabilities under these arrangements as of both
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Average investment securities were $107.36 billion and $104.60 billion in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
$105.00 billion and $106.54 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively. The
increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year
period was primarily driven by growth in U.S. Treasuries, partially offset by lower
mortgage-backed and non-U.S. sovereign and supranational securities. The
decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year
period was primarily driven by runoff within our fixed-rate portfolio, primarily lower
mortgage-backed and non-U.S. sovereign and supranational securities.
Average loans increased to $39.78 billion and $38.75 billion in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from $34.53 billion and
$34.10 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively. Average core loans, which
exclude overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged
$36.28 billion and $35.21 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, respectively, compared to $31.25 billion and $30.25 billion in the same
periods of 2023, respectively. The increase is primarily due to growth in
collateralized loan obligations in loan form and fund finance loans. Additional
information about these loans is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our prime
services business, increased to $27.70 billion and $22.87 billion in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from $18.09 billion in both the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase
in the level of cash collateral posted. Other interest-earning assets primarily reflects
prime services assets where cash has been posted to borrow securities from
lenders, which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. This cash
State Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
includes both cash from borrowers and cash utilized from our balance sheet, and is
presented on a net basis on the balance sheet where we have enforceable netting
agreements. Non-interest earning assets also includes a portion of our prime
services assets where borrower-provided non-cash collateral has been utilized to
borrow securities from lenders, which we subsequently loan, as principal, to
borrowers; in this structure our investment portfolio securities are encumbered, but
this is not reflected on the balance sheet. Combined with our prime services
liabilities, revenue from these activities generates securities finance fee revenue as
well as net interest income.
Average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $201.26 billion and
$196.39 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively, from $169.15 billion and $171.53 billion in the same periods of 2023,
respectively. The increase is driven by active engagement with our clients on
deposit raising initiatives, rotation from non-interest bearing deposits and a
reduction in the Federal Reserve’s overnight repurchase agreement activity. Future
interest-bearing deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing
business, client behavior, the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing
deposits and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S.
interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings increased to $13.64 billion and $11.68
billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from
$0.32 billion and $1.15 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively, due to
increased wholesale funding. The increase is driven by our effort to diversify our
funding sources through relatively low-cost channels, to further support business
growth.
Average long-term debt was $20.26 billion and $19.63 billion in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $18.12 billion
and $16.91 billion in the same periods of 2023, respectively. These amounts reflect
issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior and subordinated debt during the
respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with our prime
services business, were $5.24 billion and $4.81 billion in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $4.27 billion and $3.65 billion
in the same periods of 2023, respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities is
primarily driven by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a
net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest bearing
liabilities also include a portion of our prime services liabilities
where client provided non-cash collateral has been received and we have
rehypothecation rights. Securities received as collateral from our custody clients
where we have no rehypothecation rights are used as a credit mitigant only and
remain off balance sheet.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume
and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet
management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations
of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the
yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of
credit or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,
we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities
of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal
agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.
The pace at which we reinvest, and the types of investment securities purchased,
will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our
reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a $26 million provision for credit
losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain
commercial real estate and leveraged loans, combined with a change in
macroeconomic factors. There was no provision for credit losses recorded in the
third quarter of 2023.
Additional information is provided under “Loans” in "Financial Condition" in this
Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Expenses
Table 15: Expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods of 2023. Total
expenses increased 6% and 5% in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023, as higher business
investments, as well as revenue and performance-related costs, were partially offset
by productivity savings from ongoing organizational simplification, process
improvements and other

Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 5% in the three
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, mainly
due to higher performance-based incentive compensation and employee benefits,
partially offset by ongoing organizational simplification, process improvements and
other initiatives, as well as net benefits from the joint venture consolidations in India.
Compensation and employee benefits expenses were flat in nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023.
Total headcount increased 24% as of September 30, 2024 compared to
September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting the consolidation of our two operations joint
ventures in India, one in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the other in the second
quarter of 2024. Headcount cost associated with the consolidation of those joint
ventures was previously reflected in compensation and employee benefits
expenses.
Information systems and communications expenses increased 13% and 10%
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to
the same periods of 2023, reflecting higher technology and infrastructure
investments and the absence of episodic vendor credits, partially offset by
optimization savings.
Transaction processing services expenses increased 6% and 5% in the three
and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023,
primarily due to higher revenue-related costs associated with sub-custody, broker
fees and market data costs.
Occupancy expenses increased 4% and 5% in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023,
primarily driven by footprint expansion related to the joint venture consolidations in
India, partially offset by footprint optimization and one-time vendor credits.
Amortization of other intangible assets decreased by 7% and 2% in the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same
periods of 2023.
Other expenses increased 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to professional services and
travel costs. Other expenses increased 20% in the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to an increase to the
2023 FDIC special assessment in the first quarter of 2024, higher professional
services, and higher sales, marketing and other fund related expenses.

Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $195 million and $531 million in the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $89 million and
$381 million in the same periods of 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate of
21.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased from 17.4% in the
same period of 2023, primarily due to the impact of the investment portfolio
repositioning in the third quarter of 2023. Our effective tax rate of 21.8% in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, increased from 18.0% in the same period of
2023, primarily due to higher discrete tax benefits, and the impact of an investment
portfolio repositioning in 2023.

Servicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 17: Investment Servicing Line of
Business Results, increased 3% in the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, as higher average market levels and net new
business, excluding a previously disclosed client transition, were partially offset by
pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity,
including asset mix shift. Servicing fees increased 1% in the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023.
For additional information about servicing fees and the impact of worldwide
equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers
of our servicing fee revenue, refer to "Fee Revenue" in "Consolidated Results of
Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 5% and 2% in the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same
periods of 2023, as higher business investments, as well as revenue and
performance-related costs, were partially offset by productivity savings from ongoing
organizational simplification, process improvements and other initiatives, including
from the joint venture consolidations in India. Seasonal deferred incentive
compensation expense and payroll taxes were $115 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, compared to $132 million in the same period of 2023.

For additional information about our two lines of business, as well as the

FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by
the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management
lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine the
volume, mix and currency denomination of our assets and liabilities. As our clients
execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize
deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities.
These liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account
deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing
demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term
investment alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than
our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek
to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational
in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our
assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and shortduration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and
securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is
determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a
well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Additional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in
Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
We manage our investment securities portfolio by taking into consideration the
interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities along with the context
of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, and in
consideration of the global interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified,
high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the
management of our consolidated statement of condition.
Average duration of our investment securities portfolio, including the impact of
hedges, was 2.5 years and 2.7 years as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively.
Approximately 97% and 96% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated
“AA” or higher as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as
follows:

covered bonds, ABS and non-U.S. agency securities. The securities listed under
“Germany” were composed of non-U.S. agency securities, ABS and corporate debt.
Municipal Obligations
We carried approximately $0.15 billion of municipal securities classified as
state and political subdivisions in our investment securities portfolio as of
September 30, 2024, as shown in Table 19: Carrying Values of Investment
Securities, all of which were classified as AFS. As of September 30, 2024, we also
provided approximately $5.33 billion of credit and liquidity facilities to municipal
issuers.

Includes municipal loans which are also presented within Table 24: U.S. and Non-U.S. Loans.
Our aggregate municipal securities exposure presented in Table 23: State and
Municipal Obligors, was concentrated primarily with highly-rated counterparties, with
approximately 97% of the obligors rated “AA” or higher as of September 30, 2024.
As of that date, approximately 79% and 20% of our aggregate municipal securities
exposure was associated with general obligation and revenue bonds, respectively.
The portfolios are also diversified geographically, with the states that represent our
largest exposures widely dispersed across the U.S.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We sold $9 million of total loans, which consisted entirely of leveraged loans, in
the third quarter of 2024.
We had binding unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 of $146 million and $121 million, respectively, to participate in
syndications of leveraged loans. Additional information about these unfunded
commitments is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this
Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our
internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with
approximately 92% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of both September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2023. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our
investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial
institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential
investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment.
However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higherrated loans in our portfolio.
As of September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate portfolio consists of, by
asset class, approximately 38% multifamily residential, 36% office buildings and
26% other asset classes, and the portfolio does not have any construction
exposure. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the commercial real estate loans
are on properties located in multiple markets across the United States, with no
significant concentrations (New York Metro is the largest concentration at
approximately 17%). Despite not having a significant concentration in any one
market, a material decline in real estate markets or economic conditions could
negatively impact the value or performance of one or more individual properties,
which could adversely impact timely loan repayment, which may result in increased
provisions for credit losses. We observed these effects in certain commercial real
estate loans during the third quarter of 2024, resulting in additional provisions for
credit losses. Were conditions, or our evaluation of conditions, in those or other
markets to worsen during the remainder of 2024 or subsequent periods, we may
increase our allowance for credit losses during those periods.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying
classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form
10-Q.
Allowance for Credit Losses
TABLE 25: ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Nine Months Ended September

(In millions) 2024 2023
Allowance for credit losses:
Beginning balance $ 150 $ 121
Provision for credit losses (funded commitments) 69 35
Provisions for credit losses (unfunded commitments) (6) (9)
Charge-offs (42) (13)
Ending balance $ 171 $ 134
The provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial real estate and leveraged loans.
The charge-offs are primarily related to leveraged loans and a commercial real estate loan.
As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses increased
$21 million compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting provision for credit losses of
$63 million primarily due to an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain
commercial real estate and leveraged loans, partially offset by charge-offs of
$42 million, largely related to a single property in the commercial real estate
portfolio and certain leveraged loans.
As of September 30, 2024, approximately $68 million of our allowance for
credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and
financial segment compared to $72 million as of December 31, 2023. In addition,
$90 million and $60 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, was related to certain commercial real estate loans. The remaining
$13 million and $18 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively, was related to other loans, off-balance sheet commitments, interestbearing deposits with banks and other financial assets held at amortized cost,
including investment securities. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit
losses represented 0.4% of total loans.
As our view on current and future economic conditions changes, our allowance
for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a change to the
provisions for credit losses, reflecting factors such as credit migration within our loan
portfolio, as well as changes in management's economic outlook.
Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses is
provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Risk Management
In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of
risks, some that are inherent in the financial services industry, and others that are
more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses
on material risks, which include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risk, including funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• operational resiliency risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, referred to as asset
and liability management, consisting primarily of interest rate risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of them, could
affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, and are discussed
in detail on pages 24 to 53 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 Form
10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 84 to
89 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Credit and Counterparty Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading
activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal
securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement
operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central
banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet
credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and
letters of credit. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit
losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based,
among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the
estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple
economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to
develop our forecast of expected losses.
In the third quarter of 2024, the allowance estimate reflected an increase in
loan loss reserves associated with certain commercial real estate and leveraged
loans, combined with a change in macroeconomic factors. Allowance estimates are
subject to uncertainties, including those inherent in our model and economic
assumptions, and management may use qualitative adjustments. If future data and
forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for
credit losses as of September 30, 2024, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower
than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance
for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management framework,
including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,
risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring
and controls, refer to pages 90 to 94 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity
based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing
liquidity risk, we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning
indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This
process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios
which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential
increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the
potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
State Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well as on a standalone basis at our Parent Company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of
State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding
sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market, the Federal Reserve's
discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.
Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily
through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support
agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash and equivalents intended to meet its current
debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as those projected over the next
twelve-month period. Reference our SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of
Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial
distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be
available to the Parent Company. As of September 30, 2024, our Parent Company
and State Street Bank had approximately $2.28 billion of senior notes or
subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management
activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including
interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international
regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance,
supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some
cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII
or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the
way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative
regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a
non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our
efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics, refer to pages 94 to 99 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk
Management, in our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional information on our liquidity
ratios, including LCR and NSFR, refer to
page 15 and 16 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to
improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid
securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. Net cash outflows are
measured as prescribed under the LCR rule which provides a significant benefit for
deposits classified as operational. We report the LCR to the Federal Reserve daily.
For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, average daily
LCR for the Parent Company was 107% and 106%, respectively. The impact of
higher deposits on the Parent Company's LCR is limited by a cap, known as the
transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street Bank that can be
recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule. This
restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to
the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street
Bank). The average HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the Parent Company under
the LCR final rule definition was $140.98 billion for the quarter ended September 30,
2024 compared to $128.96 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023,
primarily due to an increase in client deposits relative to the prior period. For the
quarters ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the LCR for State
Street Bank was approximately 129% and 122%, respectively.
In addition, we are subject to the final rule issued by the U.S. banking agencies
implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS's) NSFR in the
U.S. which became effective on July 1, 2021. The final rule requires large banking
organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted
measure of a company’s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated
by applying standardized weightings to the company’s equity and liabilities based on
their expected stability. The amount of stable funding can be no less than the
amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized
weightings to assets,
State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity
characteristics. As a U.S. G-SIB, we are required to maintain an NSFR that is equal
to or greater than 100%. Pursuant to the BCBS's NSFR final rule, as a subsidiary of
a U.S. G-SIB, State Street Bank is similarly required to maintain an NSFR that is
equal to or greater than 100%. As of September 30, 2024, both the Parent
Company's and State Street Bank's NSFR was above the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements
governing deposits with the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central
banks of approximately $84.25 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,
compared to $69.28 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The higher
levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client
deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without
corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the
FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the
FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against
high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management.
Access to primary, intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is
an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying
conditions. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding primary credit
borrowings from the FRBB discount window, $4.00 billion outstanding of Bank Term
Funding Program and $6.00 billion outstanding of FHLB funding. As of
December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the
FRBB discount window, $1 billion outstanding of Bank Term Funding Program and
$2.5 billion outstanding borrowings from the FHLB. These outstanding borrowings
have initial maturities of twelve months and are recorded in other short-term
borrowings in the consolidated statement of condition.
In addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity, we have
other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as
collateral to access these various facilities. These additional assets are available
sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our LCR
asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $65.64 billion for
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $76.86 billion for the quarter
ended December 31, 2023.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of
client deposits; drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle
securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other
permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress
conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of our liquidity
involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to
financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our prime services
program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $33.19 billion and $34.20 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $0.98 billion and $1.51 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of
September 30, 2024, approximately 76% of our unfunded commitments to extend
credit and 23% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of
our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the
gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash
requirements.
Recovery and Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit a
resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution
strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute
on that strategy in the event of major financial distress. Through resolution planning,
we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial
system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published on November 1, 2019 requires U.S. G-SIBs to file a full
resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant
submission years. We submitted the 2023 165(d) resolution plan as required by July
1, 2023. Feedback letters from the Agencies on the results of the 2023 plan
submissions were released to each of the U.S. GSIBs on June 21, 2024. We have
no identified shortcomings or deficiencies. Our next 165(d) resolution plan
submission to the Agencies is due by July 1, 2025.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred resolution strategy is
the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the
Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company,
SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as
defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available
resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to
State Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
State Street Bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity
support (collectively with State Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts
designed to prevent the Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution
proceedings. Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the
Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries
would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a
reorganization trust for the benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by
contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,
investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other
cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the
support agreement and continues to contribute such assets, to the extent available,
on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has agreed in
the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the Parent
Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent
Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations
and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has
provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may
issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue
to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a
"Recapitalization Event", which is defined under the support agreement as the
earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being
breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for
the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support agreement
does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and SSIF may not
have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be
exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement
that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to
fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF
is a distinct legal entity
separate from the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary
Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that
identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be
made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds
are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and
liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support
that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market
confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement, (which specifically
exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential
bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to
the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and
(4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a
Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support
agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective
or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our
entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. We submitted our last
IDI plan by December 1, 2023 in alignment with changes to the IDI plan
requirements as set out in the June 25, 2021 policy statement issued by the FDIC.
Following the notice of proposed rulemaking from August 2023, the FDIC finalized
the IDI Rule in June 2024. The updated rule became effective on October 1, 2024.
The final rule requires U.S. GSIBs to file their Covered Insured Depository Institution
(CIDI) Plans on a biennial basis, with the first CIDI Plan submission due by July 1,
2026.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan periodically to the
Federal Reserve. This plan includes strategies designed to respond to stress factors
at an early stage and stabilize and maintain operational continuity and market
State Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
confidence. Our recovery strategies are intended to be implemented before our
resolution plan is triggered. We are also engaged in recovery planning requirements
in certain international jurisdictions where we operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody, accounting,
administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset
management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of
these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally
provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place
deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both September 30, 2024, and
December 31, 2023, approximately 70% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 5% in GBP and 10% in all other
currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of
the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by
pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset
Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of
liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold
under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature,
generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.
These balances were $2.12 billion and $1.87 billion as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively.
State Street Bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial
institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.04 billion as of September 30,
2024, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit
has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. As
of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no balance
outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments
and business needs.
On March 18, 2024, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.993%
fixed rate senior notes due 2027.
On August 20, 2024, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.530% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2029.
On October 1, 2024, we notified the holders of our $1 billion aggregate
principal amount of 2.354% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2025, that we will
redeem all the notes on November 1, 2024.
On October 22, 2024, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.330% fixed rate senior notes due 2027, $300 million aggregate principal amount
of floating rate senior notes due 2027, and $800 million aggregate principal amount
of 4.675% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2032.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the
maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating
agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client
deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer
products;
• facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
A downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which
could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and
large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under
securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force
terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral
agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate
the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of
these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by major rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination
payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that
could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit
ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are
no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Volatility in the global equity and fixed income markets, and heightened
geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East,
may result in stress on the operating environment and increase operational risk.
Both conflicts heighten information technology risk exposures, including cyberthreats. See also “Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages
100 to 101 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in
our 2023 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation and adoption of information technology. Information
technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by non-compliance with
regulatory obligations or expectations, information security or cyber incidents,
internal control and process gaps, operational events and adoption of new business
technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 101 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Information Technology Risk Management" in our 2023 Form 10-K, and pages 48
to 49 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 Form 10-K - "Any failures of
or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology
systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations, including
the systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business, such
as resulting from cyber-attacks, could result in significant costs, reputational
damage and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities."
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or assetand-liability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is
provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk
associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate
risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of
which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity
needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against
those factors.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into
derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign
exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward
contracts and interest rate futures. As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount
of these derivative contracts was $3.09 trillion, of which $3.02 trillion was composed
of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions
closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All
foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Market
Risk Management" in our 2023 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,
which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical
confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR,
and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk
requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a
one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to
calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of
continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The
stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in
the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR
meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that
is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial
stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking
the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from
within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial
crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011.
As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time,
future market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and
methodologies, refer to pages 105 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Valueat-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates
techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario
of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of
risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We
conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical
stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential
impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also
perform stress testing as part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and
reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example,
exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Financial Risk Committee
(FRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the
business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the FRC if material. In
addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt review by
management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based
model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves
the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss
(P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR
model using “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees,
commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the
price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees,
commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity. We experienced no back-testing exceptions in the quarters ended
September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. At a 99% confidence
interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception
every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).
The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading
activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended September 30, 2024,
June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, as measured by our VaR
methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference
between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect
arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

The three month average of our total stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $44 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to an average of
approximately $51 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and $40 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the average total stressed VaR for the
quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was primarily attributed to lower foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions. The increase in
the average total stressed VaR for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributed to higher foreign exchange
and interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our
trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction
in VaR measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,
and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.
The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of
September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the

Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and
liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic
value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits
generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio
positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our
baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 30, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts
at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our baseline rate forecast as of September 30, 2024 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at
that point in time.
TABLE 30: KEY INTEREST RATES FOR BASELINE FORECASTS

12-month forward rates 3.25 2.25 3.74 5.00 3.50 4.46
European Central Bank deposit facility rate.
In Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous 100 basis point shocks to various tenors on
the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the
adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment
assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance
rotation, including reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. The results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated for other (e.g., more severe) shocks as the impact of
interest rate shocks may not be linear. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.

The short-end is 0-3 months. The long-end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.
Our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an NII benefit in higher rate scenarios and NII exposure in lower rate scenarios. As of
September 30, 2024, our USD balance sheet's NII sensitivity is relatively neutral given expectations for USD deposit betas and the repricing characteristics of our USD assets.
Compared to September 30, 2023, our USD NII sensitivity reduced as a result of lower investment portfolio duration and higher short-term fixed rate borrowings. As of September 30,
2024, non-USD NII benefits from higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on the short-end of the yield curve. Compared to September
30, 2023, non-USD NII sensitivity increased as a result of investment portfolio activity and refinements to our modeled non-USD deposit betas.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities,
refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations, “Risk Management”.
Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry,
with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support
numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models
contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial
management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like ours, model
results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect
on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework
seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management framework,
including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 110 to 111 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or
capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of
strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic
risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market
performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary
impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit,
operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our
assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.
Management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our
business.
Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational
and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of
an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an
operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the
potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as
a strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a
major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired
business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue,
would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
Strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for its
assessment and management include the development of business plans, which
are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the Board of
Directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and
product proposals. The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is
difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical
earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to
help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and
control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with
oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and
internal risk management processes.
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial
flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own
internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by
banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge
above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all
other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to
the required minimum of 3.0% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any
regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and
discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or
financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be
subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 112 to 121 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market
risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators.
The Basel III rule provides two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the
“standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches", applicable to advanced
approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes
standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk weights for on
and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches consist of the
Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of credit risk
RWA, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of
operational risk RWA.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, we and State Street Bank, as advanced
approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to
as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy,
such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the
lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized
approach. Under the advanced approaches, State Street and State Street Bank are
subject to a 2.5% CCB requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital
buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. Under the standardized approach,
State Street Bank is subject to the same CCB and countercyclical capital buffer
requirements, but for State Street, the 2.5% CCB requirement is replaced by the
SCB requirement according to the SCB rule issued in 2020. In addition, State Street
is subject to a G-SIB surcharge.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB with a buffer
calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected
CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock
dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh
quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than
2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a
banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments to executive officers.
Our current SCB requirement is 2.5% for the period from October 1, 2023
through September 30, 2024. On June 26, 2024, we were notified by the Federal
Reserve of the results from the 2024
supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2024 supervisory stress test
was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will
continue to remain in effect from October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2024 include a CCB of
2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach,
respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This
results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2024, is 1.0%. Based
upon calculations using data as of December 31, 2023, our G-SIB surcharge will
remain at 1% through December 31, 2025.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company,
we and our IDI subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well
capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily
measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading
positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR
measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public
disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market
risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR
measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is
provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement
the Basel III endgame (July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal) for large banks, and
separately proposed revisions to the U.S. G-SIB capital surcharge framework (GSIB Surcharge Proposal). The July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal would, among
other things, eliminate the advanced approaches for risk-based capital adequacy in
favor of a new standardized expanded risk-based approach that would include,
unlike the current standardized approach, operational risk and CVA risk RWA
components, and would also replace the existing market risk rule with the new
fundamental review of the trading book (FRTB) framework. The G-SIB Surcharge
Proposal would, among other things, measure the G-SIB surcharge in more
granular 0.1% increments as opposed to the 0.5% increments that currently apply.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal would maintain the current Basel III rule’s dual-requirement structure, whereby we and State Street Bank would be required to
calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the expanded risk-based approach and the standardized approach. In addition, the proposal would modify the existing standardized
approach by requiring that the proposed new market risk standards, FRTB, also be applied in the standardized approach.
The July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal would apply the SCB and G-SIB surcharge to the risk-based capital requirements calculated under both the expanded risk-based
approach and the existing standardized approach. The July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal includes an effective date of July 1, 2025, with a three-year transition arrangement until
the requirements are fully phased in on July 1, 2028. The G-SIB Surcharge Proposal is set to be implemented two calendar quarters after the date of the adoption of the final rule,
which is currently to be determined.
Based on our understanding of the July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal, we estimated that, if the expanded risk-based approach had been applied on a fully phased-in basis
as of December 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our expanded risk-based approach RWA as of that date would have been approximately
15% higher than our actual standardized approach RWA as of that date.
Recent public statements by U.S. banking officials indicate that the July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal is under reconsideration. However, the timing and content of any
potential re-proposal, and the effects of any re-proposal on State Street, remain uncertain at this stage. Therefore, the above estimate of the effect of the July 2023 Basel III
Endgame Proposal on our RWA as of December 31, 2023 does not reflect the content of those public statements by U.S. banking officials.
Any estimate of how the expanded risk-based approach may impact us is subject to uncertainty, as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and may be materially
affected by and dependent on a range of factors, including business performance, future capital actions, the results of future supervisory stress tests, and interpretations (including
changes in interpretations) of, and potential modifications or a re-proposal by the U.S. Agencies to, the July 2023 Basel III Endgame Proposal.

 Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include disallowed deferred tax assets, cash flow hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, and the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial
condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory
review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 26, 2024, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2024
supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2024 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will continue to remain in effect from October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Our CET1 capital increased $1.10 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in net income and improved AOCI, partially
offset by dividends declared and common share repurchases in the first nine months of 2024. Our Tier 1 capital increased $1.94 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to
December 31, 2023, under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach, due to the increase in CET1 capital and net issuance of preferred stock in the first nine
months of 2024.
Our Tier 2 capital remained relatively flat as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach.
Our total capital increased by $1.94 billion and $1.96 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, under the advanced approaches and standardized
approach, respectively, primarily due to the increase in CET1 capital and net issuance of preferred stock in the first nine months of 2024.

As of September 30, 2024, total advanced approaches RWA increased $5.34 billion compared to December 31, 2023, mainly due to an increase in operational risk RWA. The
increase in operational risk RWA was primarily due to a model recalibration driven largely by an increase in the value of losses.
As of September 30, 2024, total standardized approach RWA increased $9.43 billion compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the expected normalization of RWA.
The increase in RWA mainly reflects higher repo-style transaction and derivatives RWA, both driven by increased volumes, and higher loans RWA, driven by new capital call
commitments, partially offset by other RWA, such as cash and stable value wrap.
The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2024, presented in Table 32: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the
advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with
respect to our capital and related matters as of September 30, 2024, based on our internal and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and
assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-
Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may
not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events
experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing
regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a
material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.
An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the
severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation
to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us
or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will
change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III
final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The Tier 1
leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance
sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the
denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet
assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

under the U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid
limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well
capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company
requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, is intended to improve the
resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced
prudential standards, and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD)
and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
External TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a GSIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable countercyclical

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 58 to 60 in "Related
Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and pages 167 to 169
in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof,
are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market purchases, accelerated share
repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction
may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our
financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock
issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients
for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these
activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $363.84 billion and
$279.92 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value
of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to
the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $377.23 billion and $293.86 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we
indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100%
of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. Of the collateral of $377.23 billion and $293.86 billion, referenced above, $68.13 billion and $59.03 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We or our agents held $73.21 billion and $63.11 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase
agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OTHER MATTERS
Closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and Related FDIC Matters
In March 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank and the appointment of the FDIC as the receiver for those banks, the FDIC announced
that, under the systemic risk exception set forth in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), all insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the respective
bridge banks for SVB and Signature Bank. The FDIC also announced that, as required by the FDIA, any losses to the DIF to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a
special assessment.
In November 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the protection of
uninsured depositors following the closure of SVB and Signature Bank. At that time the FDIC determined that the total special assessment for those purposes was $16.3 billion,
which is approximately equal to the FDIC’s then current estimate of losses to the DIF attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at SVB and Signature Bank. In February
2024, and again in June 2024, the FDIC disclosed that its estimate of those losses to the DIF had increased. The FDIC will ultimately determine the exact amount of losses incurred
when it terminates the receiverships of these two banks, and the amount of the special assessment will be adjusted as the loss estimates change. For IDIs such as State Street
Bank, the special assessment will be applied at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points multiplied by the IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits, reported as of December 31, 2022 and
adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, although
the collection period may change as a result of updates to the estimated loss, subsequent to the original estimate, pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments
collected change due to corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022 reporting period. The final rule was effective on April 1,
2024, with the first collection for the special assessment reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024), with a
payment date of June 28, 2024.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax expense within other expenses of approximately $387 million, reflecting State Street Bank’s allocation of the special
assessment at that time, consistent with the calculation methodology noted above. In the first quarter of 2024, we recognized an additional pre-tax expense within other expenses of
approximately $130 million primarily reflecting the FDIC's February 2024 disclosed increase to its estimate of losses to the DIF. The total expense for the special assessment remains
subject to any actions by the FDIC, as described above, to cease collection early, extend the special assessment period, or impose a one-time final shortfall special assessment,
including as a result of updates to the estimated losses, subsequent to the original estimate.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management carried out an evaluation, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of September 30, 2024.
We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no change occurred in our internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
