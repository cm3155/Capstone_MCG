MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION
GENERAL
State Street Corporation is one of the world’s largest providers of financial
services to institutional investors. Our clients - asset managers and owners,
insurance companies, official institutions, and central banks - rely on us to deliver
solutions that support their goals across the investment life cycle.
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial
strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal
banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State
Street Bank, we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including
in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. We
provide a broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors
worldwide, with $43.91 trillion of AUC/A and $4.34 trillion of AUM as of March 31,
2024.
As of March 31, 2024, we had consolidated total assets of $338.00 billion,
consolidated total deposits of $251.88 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $24.43 billion and approximately 46,000 employees.
Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing
and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services
provided.
Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2024 (Form 10-Q).
Our executive offices are located at One Congress Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02114 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Form 10-Q,
unless the context requires otherwise, references to "State Street," "we," "us," "our"
or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of this Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2023 Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 previously filed with the SEC
(2023 Form 10-K). The financial information contained in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with the financial and other
information contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts
presented in this Form 10-Q have been reclassified to conform to current-period
presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of
certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
The significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex, about matters
that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:
• Recurring fair value measurements;
• Allowance for credit losses;
• Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and
• Contingencies.
These significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex
judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision
as new information becomes available. For additional information about these
significant accounting policies refer to pages 122 to 124, “Significant Accounting
Estimates” included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K. We did not
change these significant accounting policies in the first three months of 2024.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including this
Management's Discussion and Analysis, is presented using both a U.S. GAAP, or
reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used
in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain
financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management
uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information
should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as superior to,
financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP
financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, including this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently
applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. As part of our non-GAAPbasis measures, we present a fully

taxable-equivalent NII that reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income
associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent
basis, which we believe facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our
underlying financial performance and trends.
We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory
standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with
respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading
activities), the LCR and NSFR, summary results of annual State Street-run stress
tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act, and recovery and resolution plan
disclosures. These additional disclosures are accessible on the "Filings & reports"
tab of our website at investors.statestreet.com.
We have included our website address in this report as an inactive textual
reference only. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this
Form 10-Q.
We use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and
abbreviations, as defined in the acronyms list and glossary following the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q, as well as other reports and proxy materials submitted by us
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, registration statements filed by us under
the Securities Act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other public
statements we may make, may contain statements (including statements in our
Management's Discussion and Analysis included in such reports, as applicable) that
are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. securities
laws, including statements about our goals and expectations regarding our
business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, cost
savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, climate,
dividend and stock purchase programs, acquisitions, outcomes of legal
proceedings, market growth, joint ventures and divestitures, client growth, new
technologies, services and opportunities, sustainability and impact, human capital,
as well as industry, governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends,
initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do
not relate strictly to historical facts.
Terminology such as “expect,” “outlook,” “will,” “goal,” “target,” “strategy,” “may,”
“estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “objective,” “forecast,” “believe,” “priority,” “anticipate,”
“seek,” and “trend,” or similar statements or variations of such terms, are intended to
identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements
contain such terms.
Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties,
which change over time, are based on management's expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made and are not guarantees of future
results. Management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of
the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of
factors affecting the U.S. and global economies, regulatory environment and the
equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to
State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could
cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking
statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not
limited to:
Strategic Risks
• We are subject to intense competition, which could negatively affect our
profitability;
• We are subject to significant pricing pressure and variability in our financial
results and our AUC/A and AUM;
• Our development and completion of new products and services, including
State Street Alpha and those related to digital assets and artificial
intelligence, may impose costs on us, involve dependencies on third parties
and may expose us to increased operational, model and other risks;
• Acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and the
integration, retention and development of the benefits of these transactions,
including the consolidation of our operations joint ventures in India, pose
risks for our business; and
• Competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may
not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support
our business.
Financial Market Risks
• We could be adversely affected by political, geopolitical, economic and
market conditions, including, for example, as a result of liquidity or capital
deficiencies (actual or perceived) by other financial institutions and related
market and government actions, the Israel-Hamas war and hostilities
between Iran and Israel, ongoing war in Ukraine, major political elections
globally, actions taken by central banks to address inflationary and growth
pressures, monetary policy tightening, periods of significant volatility in
valuations and liquidity or other disruptions in the markets for equity, fixed
income and other

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
assets classes globally or within specific markets;
• We have significant global operations and clients that can be adversely
impacted by disruptions in key global economies, including local, regional
and geopolitical developments affecting those economies;
• Our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and
consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes
in the financial markets, governmental action or monetary policy. For
example, among other risks, increases in prevailing interest rates or market
conditions have led, and were they to occur in the future could further lead,
to reduced levels of client deposits and resulting decreases in our NII or to
portfolio management decisions resulting in reductions in our capital or
liquidity ratios;
• Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk;
• We assume significant credit risk of counterparties, who may also have
substantial financial dependencies on other financial institutions, and these
credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss;
• Our fee revenue represents a significant portion of our revenue and is
subject to decline based on, among other factors, market and currency
declines, investment activities and preferences of our clients and their
business mix;
• If we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, our financial
condition, capital ratios, results of operations and business prospects could
be adversely affected;
• Our calculations of risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios depend on
data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are
subject to change, which could materially impact our risk exposures, our
total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period;
• We may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not
be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms; and
• If we experience a downgrade in our credit ratings, or an actual or
perceived reduction in our financial strength, our borrowing and capital
costs, liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected.
Compliance and Regulatory Risks
• Our business and capital-related activities, including common share
repurchases, may be adversely affected by regulatory requirements and
considerations, including capital, credit and liquidity;
• We face extensive and changing government regulation and supervision in
the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and
compliance risks and may affect our business activities and strategies;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and
litigation;
• Our businesses may be adversely affected by increased and conflicting
political and regulatory scrutiny of asset management stewardship and
corporate sustainability or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
practices;
• Any misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have
an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory
actions, litigation and other adverse effects;
• Changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated
results of operations and financial condition;
• Changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions
and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our
effective tax rate;
• We could face liabilities for withholding and other non-income taxes,
including in connection with our services to clients, as a result of tax
authority examinations; and
• Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other
reputational harm.
Operational and Technology Risks
Our internal control environment may be inadequate, fail or be circumvented,
and actual results may differ from those expressed as a result of a number of
factors, including the manifestation of operational risk as follows:
• Our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and
maintain our technology infrastructure, or otherwise meet the increasing
resiliency expectations of our clients and regulators, or as a result of a
cyber-attack or similar vulnerability in our or business partners'
infrastructure;
• Our risk management framework, models and processes may not be
effective in identifying or mitigating risk and reducing the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
potential for related losses, and a failure or circumvention of our controls
and procedures, or errors or delays in our operational and transaction
processing, or those of third parties, could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, operating results and reputation;
• Shifting and maintaining operational activities to non-U.S. jurisdictions,
changing our operating model, including by consolidating our operations
joint ventures in India, and outsourcing to, or insourcing from, third parties
expose us to increased operational risk, geopolitical risk and reputational
harm and may not result in expected cost savings or operational
improvements;
• Attacks or unauthorized access to our or our business partners' or clients'
information technology systems or facilities, such as cyber-attacks or other
disruptions to our or their operations, could result in significant costs,
reputational damage and impacts on our business activities;
• Long-term contracts and customizing service delivery for clients expose us
to increased operational risk, pricing and performance risk;
• We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or may infringe upon
the rights of third parties;
• The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors
that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating
results and regulatory compliance;
• Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if investors in the
collective investment pools we sponsor or manage incur substantial losses
in these investment pools or are restricted in redeeming their interests in
these investment pools;
• The impacts of climate change, and regulatory responses, and disclosure
requirements related to such risks, could adversely affect us; and
• We may incur losses or face negative impacts on our business as a result
of unforeseen events including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, climate
change, pandemics, global conflicts, an abrupt banking crisis and other
geopolitical events which may have a negative impact on our business and
operations.
Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our
forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results
due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q or
disclosed in our other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q
should not be relied on as representing our expectations or assumptions as of any
time subsequent to the time this Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. We undertake no
obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made.
The factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all
risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all
developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions and should
not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in
State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings,
including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our
annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current
reports on Form 8-K, and our registration statements filed under the Securities Act
of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the
"Filings & reports" tab of our website at investors.statestreet.com.

The following “Financial Results and Highlights” section provides information
related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial
results for the first quarter of 2024 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial
Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including
the comparison of our financial results for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the
same period of 2023, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line
of Business Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as in
our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. In this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign
currency translation, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted
average FX rates from the relevant 2023 period to the relevant 2024 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
First quarter of 2024 financial performance
• Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37, in the first quarter of 2024, decreased
10% as compared to the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting a $130
million increase to the FDIC special assessment which decreased EPS by
$0.32 in the first quarter of 2024.
• Total revenue increased 1% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, as higher fee revenue was partially offset by lower
NII.
• Total expenses increased 6% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, with approximately 5% points of that increase due to
the increase to the FDIC special assessment, and the remainder driven by
continued business investments, largely offset by productivity savings.
• Return on equity was 7.7% in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease from
9.3% in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the increase to the
FDIC special assessment which contributed 1.8% points to the decrease.
Pre-tax margin of 19.1% in the first quarter of 2024 decreased from 22.2%
in the same period of 2023, primarily due to the increase to the FDIC
special assessment.
• Operating leverage was (4.9)% points in the first quarter of 2024, largely
due to the increase to the FDIC special assessment which decreased
operating leverage by 5.5% points in the first quarter of 2024. Operating
leverage represents the difference between the percentage change in total
revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative
to the same period of the prior year.
• Fee operating leverage was (2.4)% points in the first quarter of 2024. The
increase to the FDIC special assessment decreased fee operating leverage
by 5.5% in the first quarter of 2024. Fee operating leverage represents the
difference between the percentage change in total fee revenue and the
percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the same
period of the prior year.
• We returned a total of approximately $308 million to our shareholders in the
form of common share repurchases and common stock dividends.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Revenue
• Total fee revenue increased 4% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, reflecting higher management fees, software and
processing fees, servicing fees and other fee revenue, partially offset by
lower securities finance and FX trading services revenue.
• Servicing fee revenue increased 1% in the first quarter of 2024, compared
to the same period of 2023, primarily driven by higher average market
levels, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and
adjustments, including changes in client asset mix, and a previously
disclosed client transition.
• Management fee revenue increased 12% in the first quarter of 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, as higher average market levels and
net inflows from prior periods were partially offset by the impact of a
previously disclosed strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative.
• Foreign exchange trading services revenue decreased 3% in the first
quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to
lower spreads associated with subdued market volatility, partially offset by
higher client FX volumes.
• Securities finance revenue decreased 12% in the first quarter of 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023, largely driven by lower agency
balances and lower spreads primarily due to muted industry specials
activity.
• Software and processing fees revenue increased 25% in the first quarter of
2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily driven by higher front
office software and data revenue associated with CRD.
• Other fee revenue increased $5 million in the first quarter of 2024,
compared to the same period of 2023.
• NII decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period
of 2023, primarily due to deposit mix shift towards interest-bearing deposits
and lower average non-interest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by
the impact of higher average interest rates, client lending growth and
investment portfolio positions.
Provision for Credit Losses
• In the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $27 million provision for credit
losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with
certain commercial
real estate loans. The provision in the first quarter of 2023 was $44 million
which included an episodic provision of $29 million associated with industry
support for a U.S. financial institution.
Expenses
• Total expenses increased 6% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the
same period of 2023, with approximately 5% points of that increase due to
the increase to the FDIC special assessment, and the remainder driven by
continued business investments, largely offset by productivity savings.
Notable items
• First quarter of 2024 other expenses included a $130 million increase to the
FDIC special assessment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily
related to the increase to the FDIC’s estimate of losses to the DIF
associated with the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
• There were no notable items in the first quarter of 2023.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $43.91 trillion as of March 31, 2024, increased 17% compared to
March 31, 2023, primarily due to higher quarter-end market levels and net
new business. In the first quarter of 2024, newly announced asset servicing
mandates totaled approximately $474 billion of AUC/A. We onboarded
approximately $203 billion of AUC/A during the first quarter of 2024.
Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled
approximately $2.58 trillion of AUC/A as of March 31, 2024.
• AUM of $4.3 trillion as of March 31, 2024, increased 20% compared to
March 31, 2023, primarily due to higher quarter-end market levels and net
inflows.
Capital
• In the first quarter of 2024, we returned a total of approximately $308 million
to our shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and common
stock dividends.
◦ We declared aggregate common stock dividends of $0.69 per
share, totaling $208 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to
$0.63 per share, totaling $212 million in the same period of 2023,
representing an increase of approximately 10% on a per share
basis.
State Street Corporation | 9
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
◦ In the first quarter of 2024, we acquired an aggregate of 1.4 million
shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $73.24
and an aggregate cost of approximately $100 million. These
purchases were all conducted under the share repurchase program
approved by our Board of Directors in January 2024.
• Our standardized CET1 capital ratio decreased to 11.1% as of March 31,
2024, compared to 11.6% as of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the
expected normalization of RWA as of March 31, 2024. Our Tier 1 leverage
ratio decreased to 5.4% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 5.5% as of
December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher consolidated average assets
reflecting higher client deposits and an increase in wholesale funding,
partially offset by the net issuance of preferred stock. Given the current
global economic environment, and our plans for capital distributions, we
currently expect our CET1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio to remain
within or above our target ranges of 10-11% and 5.25-5.75%, respectively.
• On January 31, 2024, we issued 1.5 million depositary shares, each
representing 1/100th ownership interest in shares of fixed-to-floating rate,
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series I, without par value per
share, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent to
$1,000 per depositary share), and an initial dividend rate of 6.700% per
annum, in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering were
approximately $1.5 billion.
• On March 15, 2024, we redeemed an aggregate $1.0 billion, or all 7,500
outstanding shares, of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series
D, for a cash redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per
depository share) and all 2,500 of the outstanding shares of our
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series F, for a cash redemption
price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share),
plus all declared and unpaid dividends.
Debt Issuances
• On March 18, 2024, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.993% fixed rate senior notes due 2027.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023. Servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 72% of
the total fee revenue in both the first quarter of 2024 and 2023.
Servicing Fee Revenue
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, increased 1% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily driven by higher average
market levels, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments, including changes in client asset mix due to a shift in assets into lower fee asset classes
including cash products, and a previously disclosed client transition.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% and 46% of total servicing fees in the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from a range of services provided to our clients, including certain Alpha servicing mandates, consisting of core custody services,
accounting, reporting and administration, which we refer to collectively as back office and middle office services. The nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for
which the services are performed affect our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several
factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. For servicing fees for which we have
not yet issued an invoice to our clients as of period end, we include an estimate of the impact of changes in market valuations, client activity and flows, net new business and
changes in pricing in our revenues.
Changes in Market Valuations
Our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding
impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our
clients’ portfolios. For certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex, including alternative investments, or where our valuation is dependent on third party
information, AUC/A is reported on a time lag, typically one-month. For those asset classes, the impact of market levels on our reported AUC/A does not reflect current period-end
market levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately
2% on average with a range of (4)% to 8% annually and approximately 1% and (4)% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on
our servicing fees, which historically was included within client activity and asset flows, is now reflected within change in market valuations. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End
Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to
individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices
presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.
Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity, asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31, 2024 that a 10%
increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a
corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors remain
constant and using relevant information as of March 31, 2024, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less
volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire
transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors,
including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five
years ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately (1)% on average with a range of
(3)% to 1% annually and approximately (3)% and 0% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. As noted under "Changes in Market Valuations" in this section, this analysis now excludes, but
in prior reporting previously included, the impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets on our servicing fees. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow
information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our
flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.

Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2023, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 0% on
average with a range of 0% to 1% annually and approximately 1% in both 2023 and 2022.
Gross investment servicing mandates were $474 billion of AUC/A in the first quarter of 2024 and $1.80 trillion of AUC/A per year on average over the five years ended
December 31, 2023, ranging from approximately $0.79 trillion to $3.52 trillion of AUC/A annually in any given year.
Servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of
assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from
6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. We expect that our more complex installations, including new State
Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of the 6 to 36 months range. With

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
respect to the current asset mandates of approximately $2.58 trillion of AUC/A that are yet to be installed as of March 31, 2024, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming
24 months, with approximately 40-50% expected to be installed in the remainder of 2024, with the balance expected to be installed throughout 2025 and 2026. The expected timing
of these installations is subject to change due to a variety of factors, including adjusted implementation schedules agreed with clients, scope adjustments, and product and
functionality changes.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no
assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A, once installed, can vary materially. On
average, over the five years ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (3)%
annually, with the impact ranging from (2)% to (4)% in any given year and approximately (2)% in both 2023 and 2022. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation
with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the term of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our
dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional
services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to
onboard those new services or process changes, the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors. These same market pressures also impact the fees
we negotiate when we win business from new clients.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 60%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes
in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another approximately 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in
the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 25% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of
products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee
revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the first quarter of 2024 totaled approximately $474 billion of AUC/A. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods
totaled approximately $2.58 trillion as of March 31, 2024, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent
periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, consents or assignments, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary
regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for
which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time
may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its
permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time we
determine the business to be won by us and are not updated based on subsequent developments, including changes in assets, market valuations, scope and, potentially,
termination. Such assets therefore do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which
may from time to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including back office services such as custody and safekeeping, transaction
processing and trade settlement, fund administration, reporting and record keeping, security servicing, fund accounting, middle office services such as investment book of records,
transaction management, loans, cash derivatives and collateral services, recordkeeping, client reporting and investment analytics, markets services such as FX trading services,
liquidity solutions, currency and collateral management and securities finance, and front office services such as portfolio management solutions, risk analytics, scenario analysis,
performance and attribution, trade order and execution management, pre-trade compliance and ESG investment tools. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary
based on the breadth of services provided, the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As previously disclosed, in early 2021, due to a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients is moving a significant portion of its ETF assets currently
with State Street to one or more other providers. Prior to the commencement of the transition of assets, which began in 2022, we estimated that the financial impact of this transition
represented approximately 1.9% of our 2021 total fee revenue. We began to see the impact of the transition on our fee revenue and income growth trends primarily towards the end
of 2023, with the remainder expected to be realized through 2025 as the transition continues. On a quarterly run rate basis, we estimate that the first quarter of 2024 reflected
approximately half of the revenue impact of the exiting business. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue
to be meaningful to our business.
Management Fee Revenue
Management fees increased 12% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, as higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods were
partially offset by the impact of a previously disclosed strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative.
Management fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 25% of total management fees in both the first quarter of 2024 and 2023.
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets,
such as ETFs, mutual funds and Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is
more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are
dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee
revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively
managed products. Actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks
associated with the applicable account's performance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31, 2024, and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won
and lost and client flows, that:
• A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would
result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will have a
significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Quarter-end
indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices
presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant
indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications
presented.

Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased 3% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily
due to lower spreads associated with subdued market volatility, partially offset by higher client FX volumes. Foreign exchange trading services revenue comprises revenue generated
by FX trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 65% and 35%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the first
quarter of 2024, compared to 68% and 32%, respectively, in the same period of 2023.
We primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”
• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. Clients are able to
choose their own execution time and method, trading by voice or electronically on one of the several available multibank platforms. These principal market-making activities
include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.
• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX desk through our assetservicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. Indirect FX is designed to address FX trades that relate to the purchase,
sale or holding of a security where clients chose their execution frequency (either hourly or once per day), allowing us to offer straight-through processing and a fully
automated service.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market
conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading
revenues often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix
tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either
direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker,
enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at
another bank.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic
FX services" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."
• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions
through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions
generate revenue through a “click” fee.
• Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which
are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions
charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.
Fund Connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms: it is a global
trading, analytics and cash management tool with access to more than 400 money
market funds from leading providers.
Securities Finance
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 2: Total Revenue, decreased
12% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, due to lower
agency balances and lower spreads primarily due to muted industry specials
activity.
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we
refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset
owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer
to as our prime services business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is
composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees
related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on
loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our
share of the fee split.
As principal, our prime services business borrows securities from the lending
client or other market participants and then lends such securities to
the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal
when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the
market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as
principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we
source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as
principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets
under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending
activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards,
interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or prime services businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity
and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 2: Total Revenue,
increased 25% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023,
primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with
CRD.
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our
structured products business.
Front office software and data revenue, which primarily includes revenue from
CRD, Alpha Data Platform and Alpha Data Services, increased 32% in the first
quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher
software-enabled and professional services revenue reflecting continued SaaS
implementations and conversions.
Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily
driven by the sale of term software licenses and SaaS, including professional
services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and
maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of
software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when the
customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the
percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms.
The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length
of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon renewal of an
on-premises software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is
State Street Corporation | 17
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the remaining balance
recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement,
where the customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over
the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of a SaaS
arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under
the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue
are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to
quarter.
Lending related and other fees increased 13% in the first quarter of 2024
compared to the same period of 2023, reflecting higher unfunded commitments
primarily relating to our fund finance products. Lending related and other fees
primarily consists of fee revenue associated with our fund finance, leverage loans,
municipal finance, insurance and stable value wrap businesses.
Other Fee Revenue
Other fee revenue includes market-related adjustments and income associated
with other equity method investments.
Other fee revenue increased $5 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to

Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest
expense for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less
interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets,
which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with
banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by
client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable-equivalent
(FTE) NII and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by
dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from
income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political
subdivisions), is adjusted to an FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory
income tax rates.
NII decreased 7% in the first quarter of 2024
compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to deposit mix shift towards
interest-bearing deposits and lower average non-interest-bearing deposit balances,
partially offset by the impact of higher average interest rates, client lending growth
and investment portfolio positions.
Investment securities' net purchase discount accretion increased interest
income by $34 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to net purchase
premium amortization that reduced interest income by $14 million in the same
period of 2023. The change in the net purchase premium amortization (discount
accretion) was primarily driven by a shift in the non-MBS portfolio from a net
unamortized purchase premium as of March 31, 2023 to a net unamortized
purchase discount as of March 31, 2024.
Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated
statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis
approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the
security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as
purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for
prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.
The following table presents the investment securities net premium
amortization (discount accretion) for the periods indicated:

Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the components of interest
income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $254.33 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $237.53 billion in the same period of 2023. The increase is primarily due to
higher levels of client deposits and an increase in short-term wholesale funding and long-term debt.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $90.23 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $77.22 billion in the same period of 2023. These deposits primarily reflect
our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks. The higher levels of average cash balances reflect higher levels of client
deposits and funding levels.
Securities purchased under resale agreements averaged $6.12 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.64 billion in the same period of 2023 due to a shift to term
repurchase agreements, which reduces our ability to net against resale agreement balances. Additionally, as a member of FICC, we may net securities sold under repurchase
agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization, when specific netting criteria are met. The
impact of balance sheet netting was $171.83 billion on average in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $116.65 billion in the same period of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in
FICC repurchase agreement volumes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We are a direct and sponsoring member of FICC. As a sponsoring member
within FICC, we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities
with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC
Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We
may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC,
backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance
of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. We generally obtain a
security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral
that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.
Additionally, as a member of certain industry clearing and settlement
exchanges, we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by
the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another
member to the extent that the defaulting member’s clearing fund obligation and the
prescribed loss allocation to FICC is depleted. It is difficult to estimate our maximum
possible exposure under the membership agreement, since this would require an
assessment of future claims that may be made against us that have not yet
occurred. We did not record any liabilities under these arrangements as of both
March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Average investment securities decreased to $101.32 billion in the first quarter
of 2024 from $107.09 billion in the same period of 2023, primarily due to maturities
within our fixed-rate portfolio, and portfolio repositioning.
Average loans increased to $37.75 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared
to $33.52 billion in the same period of 2023. Average core loans, which exclude
overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged
$34.30 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $29.21 billion in the same
period of 2023. The increase is primarily due to growth in collateralized loan
obligations in loan form and fund finance loans. Additional information about these
loans is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-
Q.
Average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our prime
services business, increased to $18.15 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from
$17.39 billion in the same period of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in the level
of cash collateral posted. Other interest-earning assets primarily reflects prime
services assets where cash has been posted to borrow securities from lenders,
which are then lent by us, as principal, to borrowers. This cash includes both cash
from borrowers and cash utilized from our balance sheet, and is presented on a net
basis on the balance sheet where
we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest earning assets also includes
a portion of our prime services assets where borrower-provided non-cash collateral
has been utilized to borrow securities from lenders, which we subsequently loan, as
principal, to borrowers; in this structure our investment portfolio securities are
encumbered, but this is not reflected on the balance sheet. Combined with our
prime services liabilities, revenue from these activities generates securities finance
fee revenue as well as net interest income.
Average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $191.93 billion in the first
quarter of 2024 from $171.62 billion in the same period of 2023. The increase is
driven by active engagement with our clients on deposit raising initiatives, rotation
from non-interest bearing deposits and a reduction in the Federal Reserve’s
overnight repurchase agreement activity. Future interest-bearing deposit levels will
be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client behavior, the mix of
interest-bearing and non-interest bearing deposits and market conditions, including
the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings increased to $8.31 billion in the first
quarter of 2024, from $1.28 billion in the same period of 2023, due to increased
wholesale funding. The increase is driven by our effort to diversify our funding
sources through relatively low-cost channels, with initial maturities of twelve months,
to further support business growth.
Average long-term debt was $18.94 billion in the first quarter of 2024
compared to $15.87 billion in the same period of 2023. These amounts reflect
issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior and subordinated debt during the
respective periods.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities, largely associated with our prime
services business, were $4.43 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $3.08
billion in the same period of 2023. Other interest-bearing liabilities is primarily driven
by cash received from our custody clients, which is presented on a net basis where
we have enforceable netting agreements. Non-interest bearing liabilities also
include a portion of our prime services liabilities where client provided non-cash
collateral has been received and we have rehypothecation rights. Securities
received as collateral from our custody clients where we have no rehypothecation
rights are used as a credit mitigant only and remain off balance sheet.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume
and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet
management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest
rates;
State Street Corporation | 20
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of
those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields
earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of credit
or other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,
we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities
of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federal
agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities.
The pace at which we reinvest, and the types of investment securities purchased,
will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory
standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our
reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
In the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $27 million provision for credit
losses, primarily reflecting an increase in loan loss reserves associated with certain
commercial real estate loans. This compared to a $44 million provision for credit
losses recorded in the same period of 2023, which primarily reflected an episodic
provision associated with industry support for a U.S. financial institution.

Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Expenses
Table 15: Expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the first quarters of
2024 and 2023. Total expenses increased 6% in the first quarter of 2024 compared
to the same periods of 2023, with approximately 5% points of that increase due to
the increase to the FDIC special assessment, and the remainder driven by
continued business investments, largely offset by productivity savings.

compensation, salaries and contractor spend.
Total headcount increased 7% as of March 31, 2024 compared to March 31,
2023, primarily reflecting the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in
India in the fourth quarter of 2023. On April 1, 2024, we completed the consolidation
of our second operations joint venture in India, which will increase headcount in the
second quarter of 2024. Associated headcount cost was previously reflected in
compensation and employee benefits expenses.
Information systems and communications expenses increased 4% in the first
quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, reflecting higher technology
and infrastructure investments, partially offset by optimization savings and vendor
savings.
Transaction processing services expenses increased 4% in the first quarter of
2024 compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher revenue-related
broker fees.
Occupancy expenses increased 10% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to
the same period of 2023, mainly associated with consolidating an operations joint
venture in India and other real estate costs, partially offset by footprint optimization.
Amortization of other intangible assets was flat in the first quarter of 2024
compared to the same period of 2023.
Other expenses increased 55% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the
same period of 2023, primarily due to the increase to the fourth quarter of 2023
FDIC special assessment, as well as the timing of our funding of our charitable
foundation.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management lines of
business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine the volume, mix and currency denomination of our assets and liabilities. As our clients execute their worldwide
cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of
interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally
serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities;
however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain
longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as
interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our
desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

of these non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate.
As of March 31, 2024, our non-U.S. debt securities had an average market-tobook ratio of 99.1%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized loss of $243 million,
consisting of gross unrealized gains of $69 million and gross unrealized losses of
$312 million. These unrealized amounts included:
• a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $92 million, consisting of gross unrealized
gains of $67 million and gross unrealized losses of $159 million, associated
with non-U.S. AFS debt securities; and
• a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $151 million, consisting of gross unrealized
gains of $2
million and gross unrealized losses of $153 million, associated with nonU.S. HTM debt securities.
As of March 31, 2024, the underlying collateral for non-U.S. MBS and ABS
primarily included mortgages in Australia, the U.K., the Netherlands and Italy. The

Fund finance loans include primarily $10.15 billion private equity capital call finance loans, $6.49 billion loans to real money
funds and $1.01 billion loans to business development companies as of March 31, 2024, compared to $9.69 billion private equity
capital call finance loans, $6.63 billion loans to real money funds and $1.05 billion loans to business development companies as
of December 31, 2023.
Includes $2.17 billion securities finance loans, $276 million loans to municipalities and $4 million other loans as of March 31,
2024 and $2.23 billion securities finance loans, $276 million loans to municipalities and $5 million other loans as of December 31,
2023.
As of March 31, 2024, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $31.98 billion and fixed rate loans totaled $2.93 billion. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with EURIBOR indexed
floating-rate loans. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional details.
The increase in domestic loans was primarily driven by an increase in fund
finance loans, leveraged loans and overdrafts, and the increase in foreign loans was
primarily driven by fund finance loans, overdrafts and collateralized loan obligations
in loan form as of March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.
As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our leveraged loans totaled
approximately $3.71 billion and $3.61 billion, respectively. We sold $102 million of
total loans, which consists of $52 million of leveraged loans and $50 million of
commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of 2024.
We had binding unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023 of
$37 million and $121 million, respectively, to participate in syndications of leveraged
loans. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in Note
9 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our
internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with
approximately 91% and 92% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of March 31, 2024
and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally
limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global
financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential
investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment.
However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higherrated loans in our portfolio.
As of March 31, 2024, the commercial real estate portfolio consists of, by asset
class, approximately 39% multifamily residential, 34% office buildings and 27%
other asset classes, and the portfolio does not have any construction exposure.
Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, the commercial real estate loans are on
properties located in multiple markets across the United States, with no significant
concentrations (New York Metro is the largest concentration at approximately 16%).
Despite not having a significant concentration in any one market, a material decline
in real estate markets or economic conditions could negatively impact the value or
performance of one or more individual properties, which could adversely impact
timely loan repayment, which may result in increased provisions for credit losses. We observed these effects in certain commercial real estate loans during the first
quarter of 2024, resulting in additional provisions for credit losses. Were conditions,
or our evaluation of conditions, in those or other markets to worsen during 2024 or
subsequent periods, we may increase our allowance for credit losses during those
periods.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying
classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form
10-Q.

Allowance for Credit Losses
TABLE 25: ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
Three Months Ended March 31,
(In millions) 2024 2023
Allowance for credit losses:
Beginning balance $ 150 $ 121
Provision for credit losses (funded commitments) 31 21
Provisions for credit losses (unfunded commitments) (4) (7)
Provisions for credit losses (other) — 30
Charge-offs (31) (3)
Ending balance $ 146 $ 162
The provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial real estate loans.
Consists primarily of a provision associated with industry support for a U.S. financial institution and the impact of foreign
currency translation.
The charge-offs are primarily related to leveraged loans and commercial real estate loans.
As of March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses decreased $4 million
compared to December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting charge-offs of $31 million,
largely related to a single property in the commercial real estate portfolio, and a
provision for credit losses of $27 million driven by an increase in loan loss reserves
associated with certain commercial real estate loans.
As of March 31, 2024, approximately $71 million of our allowance for credit
losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial
segment compared to $82 million as of March 31, 2023. In addition, $60 million and
$29 million as of both March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, was related to certain
commercial real estate loans. The remaining $15 million and $51 million as of
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively, was related to other loans, offbalance sheet commitments, interest-bearing deposits with banks and other
financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities. As of
March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.4% of total loans.
As our view on current and future economic conditions changes, our allowance
for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a change to the
provisions for credit losses, reflecting factors such as credit migration within our loan
portfolio, as well as changes in management's economic outlook.
Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses is
provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Risk Management
In the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of
risks, some that are inherent in the financial services industry, and others that are
more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses
on material risks, which include the following:
• credit and counterparty risk;
• liquidity risk, including funding and management;
• operational risk;
• information technology risk;
• operational resiliency risk;
• market risk associated with our trading activities;
• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, referred to as asset
and liability management, consisting primarily of interest rate risk;
• model risk;
• strategic risk; and
• reputational, compliance, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of them, could
affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, and are discussed
in detail on pages 24 to 53 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 Form
10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 84 to
89 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Credit and Counterparty Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to
repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading
activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal
securities lending and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also
assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement
operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central
banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Allowance for Credit Losses
We record an allowance for credit losses related to certain on-balance sheet
credit exposures, including our financial assets held at amortized cost, as well as
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and
letters of credit. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit
losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based,
among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the
estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple
economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to
develop our forecast of expected losses.
In the first quarter of 2024, the reduction in the allowance estimate reflected
charge-offs, primarily related to a single commercial real estate loan, largely offset
by an increase in reserves for the commercial real estate portfolio, with
management's economic outlook and the leveraged loan portfolio remaining
relatively stable. Allowance estimates are subject to uncertainties, including those
inherent in our model and economic assumptions, and management may use
qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts
utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2024, or if
credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of
the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in
Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
For additional information about our credit risk management framework,
including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,
risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring
and controls, refer to pages 90 to 94 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Credit
Risk Management, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity
based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing
liquidity risk, we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning
indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This
process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios
which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential
increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the
potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis as well as on a standalone basis at our Parent Company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of
State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding
sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market, the Federal Reserve's
discount window and the Bank Term Funding Program. The Parent Company is
managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.
Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily
through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and the support
agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management's
Discussion and Analysis, enough cash and equivalents intended to meet its current
debt maturities and other cash needs, as well as those projected over the next
twelve-month period. Reference our SPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of
Liquidity" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis. Absent financial
distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be
available to the Parent Company. As of March 31, 2024, our Parent Company and
State Street Bank had approximately $0.98 billion of senior notes or subordinated
debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
As a systemically important financial institution, our liquidity risk management
activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including
interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international
regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance,
supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and
other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some
cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII
or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the
way in which we deliver our products and services. If we fail to meet regulatory
requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative
regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a
non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our
efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics, refer to pages 94 to 99 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity Risk
Management, in our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional information on
State Street Corporation | 29
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
our liquidity ratios, including LCR and NSFR, refer to page 15 and 16 included
under Item 1, Business, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to
improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid
securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. Net cash outflows are
measured as prescribed under the LCR rule which provides a significant benefit for
deposits classified as operational. We report the LCR to the Federal Reserve daily.
For the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, average daily LCR
for the Parent Company was 107% and 106%, respectively. The impact of higher
deposits on the Parent Company's LCR is limited by a cap, known as the
transferability restriction, on the HQLA from State Street Bank that can be
recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the U.S. LCR Final Rule. This
restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to
the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street
Bank). The average HQLA, post-prescribed haircuts for the Parent Company under
the LCR final rule definition was $143.28 billion for the quarter ended March 31,
2024 compared to $128.96 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023,
primarily due to an increase in client deposits relative to the prior period. For the
quarter ended March 31, 2024, the LCR for State Street Bank was approximately
130%.
In addition, we are subject to the final rule issued by the U.S. banking agencies
implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS's) NSFR in the
U.S. which became effective on July 1, 2021. The final rule requires large banking
organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted
measure of a company’s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated
by applying standardized weightings to the company’s equity and liabilities based on
their expected stability. The amount of stable funding can be no less than the
amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized
weightings to assets,
derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity
characteristics. As a U.S. G-SIB, we are required to maintain an NSFR that is equal
to or greater than 100%. Pursuant to the BCBS's NSFR final rule, as a subsidiary of
a U.S. G-SIB, State Street Bank is similarly required to maintain an NSFR that is
equal to or greater than 100%. As of March 31, 2024, both the Parent Company's
and State Street Bank's NSFR was above the 100% minimum NSFR requirement.
We maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements
governing deposits with the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central
banks of approximately $86.74 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024,
compared to $69.28 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The higher
levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client
deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without
corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the
FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the
FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against
high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management.
Access to primary, intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is
an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying
conditions. As of March 31, 2024, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings
from the FRBB discount window, $8 billion outstanding of Bank Term Funding
Program and $3.5 billion outstanding of FHLB funding. As of December 31, 2023,
we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window,
$1 billion outstanding of Bank Term Funding Program and $2.5 billion outstanding
borrowings from the FHLB. These outstanding borrowings have initial maturities of
twelve months, are recorded in other short-term borrowings in the consolidated
statement of condition.
In addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity, we have
other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as
collateral to access these various facilities. These additional assets are available
sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our LCR
asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $69.52 billion for
the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $76.86 billion for the quarter ended
December 31, 2023.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of
client deposits; drawState Street Corporation | 30
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle
securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other
permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress
conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of our liquidity
involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to
financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our prime services
program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $34.57 billion and $34.20 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $1.49 billion and $1.51 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of
March 31, 2024, approximately 77% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit
and 35% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our
commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross
contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Recovery and Resolution Planning
Under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit a
resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (the
Agencies). The purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution
strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute
on that strategy in the event of major financial distress. Through resolution planning,
we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial
system, while minimizing risk to the financial system.
The final rule published on November 1, 2019 requires U.S. G-SIBs to file a full
resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant
submission years. We submitted our updated 2023 165(d) resolution plan by July 1,
2023. Under the 165(d) rule, results are due from the Agencies by July 1, 2024,
unless the deadline is extended due to extenuating circumstances. Our next 165(d)
resolution plan submission to the Agencies is due by July 1, 2025.
In the event of material financial distress, our preferred resolution strategy is
the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the
Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company,
SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as
defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available
resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other
entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively
with State Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the
Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following
the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent
Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a
newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of
the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIF by
contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,
investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other
cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the
support agreement and continues to contribute such assets, to the extent available,
on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has agreed in
the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the Parent
Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent
Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent
Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations
and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has
provided the Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may
issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company
Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue
to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a
"Recapitalization Event", which is defined under the support agreement as the
earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being
breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for
the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The support
agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and
SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be
exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement
that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to
fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF
is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent
Company’s other affiliates.
State Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
In accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary
Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that
identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be
made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. The trigger thresholds
are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and
liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support
that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market
confidence restored.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement, (which specifically
exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential
bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity
support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to
the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and
(4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a
Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support
agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective
or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our
entities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for
resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an IDI plan. We submitted our last
IDI plan by December 1, 2023 in alignment with changes to the IDI plan
requirements as set out in the June 25, 2021 policy statement issued by the FDIC.
The FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the IDI Rule in August 2023
that, among other changes, would require IDI Plans to be submitted on a biennial
basis by Group A filers (IDIs with $100 billion or more in total assets), which is the
category applicable to State Street.
Additionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan periodically to the
Federal Reserve. This plan includes strategies designed to respond to stress factors
at an early stage and stabilize and maintain operational continuity and market
confidence. Our recovery strategies are intended to be implemented before our
resolution plan is triggered. We are also engaged in recovery planning
requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we operate.
Funding
Deposits
We provide products and services including custody, accounting,
administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset
management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of
these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally
provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place
deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of both March 31, 2024, and
December 31, 2023, approximately 70% of our average total deposit balances were
denominated in U.S. dollars, 15% in EUR, 5% in GBP and 10% in all other
currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of
the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by
pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In
addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source
incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset
Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of
liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold
under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature,
generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities.
These balances were $3.58 billion and $1.87 billion as of March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively.
State Street Bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial
institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.03 billion as of March 31, 2024,
to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no
stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice. As of
both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no balance outstanding on
this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business
needs.
On March 18, 2024, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.993% fixed rate senior notes due 2027.
State Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Agency Credit Ratings
Our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the
maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating
agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:
• diverse and stable core earnings;
• relative market position;
• strong risk management;
• strong capital ratios;
• diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client
deposits;
• strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and
• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.
High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:
• providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors;
• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer
products;
• facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions; and
• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.
A downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which
could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and
large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to
drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under
securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force
terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
A majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral
agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate
the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of
these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a
downgrade by major rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination
payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that
could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit
ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the
consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are
no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
Volatility in the global equity and fixed income markets, and heightened
geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas
war, may result in stress on the operating environment and increase operational
risk. Both conflicts heighten information technology risk exposures, including cyberthreats. See also “Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to pages
100 to 101 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk Management", in
our 2023 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership, operation and adoption of information technology. Information
technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by non-compliance with
regulatory obligations or expectations, information security or cyber incidents,
internal control and process gaps, operational events and adoption of new business
technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk framework and
associated risks, refer to pages 101 to 103 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
"Information Technology Risk Management" in our 2023 Form 10-K, and pages 48
to 49 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2023 Form 10-K - "Any failures of
or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology
systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations, including the
systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business, such as
resulting from cyber-attacks, could result in significant costs, reputational damage
and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities."
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or assetand-liability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is
provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk
associated with our non-trading activities, which
State Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability
Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of
which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity
needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against
those factors.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into
derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign
exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward
contracts and interest rate futures. As of March 31, 2024, the notional amount of
these derivative contracts was $2.82 trillion, of which $2.77 trillion was composed of
foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions
closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All
foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our trading
activities, refer to pages 103 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Market
Risk Management" in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR
We use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,
which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical
confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR,
and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading
activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk
requirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical
volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a
one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.
We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to
calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of
continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The
stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome
occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This
stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an
outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period
of financial stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically
by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day
VaR from within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the
financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone
sovereign debt crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in
August 2011. As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands
over time, future market stress events will be incorporated.
For additional information about our VaR measurement tools and
methodologies, refer to pages 105 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Valueat-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates
techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario
of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of
risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We
conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events
that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our
current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress
testing as part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review (CCAR) process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the
corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk,
interest rate risk and volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and reported to the Credit and Market Risk
Committee (CMRC). Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in
conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the
CMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that
prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.

Validation and Back-Testing
We perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of
estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which
excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions,
changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity. We experienced no back-testing exceptions in the quarters ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023. At a 99% confidence interval, the statistical
expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).
The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended March 31, 2024, December 31,
2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of
the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.

The three month average of our total stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $47 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to an average of
approximately $51 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and $35 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The slight decrease in the average total stressed VaR for
the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2023, is primarily attributed to lower foreign exchange and interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures as presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our
trading activities. While overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods, smaller residual market risk positions during the quarter have led to a reduction
in VaR measures presented.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,
and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.

For purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates. Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate
risk. Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and
liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic
value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits
generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, as well as the currency
composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client deposits.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio
positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Our
baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Table 30, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts
at March 31, 2024 and 2023. Our baseline rate forecast as of March 31, 2024 was generally consistent with common market expectations for global central bank actions at that point
in time, which implied that rate cuts will begin in 2024.

In Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous 100 basis point shocks to various tenors on
the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the
adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment
assumptions change, for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes client deposit balance
rotation, including reductions in non-interest-bearing deposit balances. The results of these scenarios should not be extrapolated for other (e.g., more severe) shocks as the impact
of interest rate shocks may not be linear. In lower rate scenarios, the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.

Our overall balance sheet, including all currencies, continues to be asset sensitive with an NII benefit in higher rate scenarios and NII exposure in lower rate scenarios. As of
March 31, 2024, our USD balance sheet's NII sensitivity is relatively neutral given expectations for USD deposit betas and the repricing characteristics of our USD assets. Compared
to March 31, 2023, our USD NII sensitivity reduced as a result of lower investment portfolio balances and higher short-term fixed rate borrowings, partially offset by the impact of
rising deposit betas and deposit rotation. As of March 31, 2024, non-USD NII benefits from higher rate scenarios and is exposed to lower rates primarily driven by our sensitivities on
the short-end of the yield curve. Compared to March 31, 2023, our non-USD NII sensitivity increased as a result of refinements to our modeled non-USD deposit betas.

Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects
of their financial decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. In large banking
organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. As a result, the Model Risk
Management Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For additional information about our model risk management framework, including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 110 to 111 included under Item 7,
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or
lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our
business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate
strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. Management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our
business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational
and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of
an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an
operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the
potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as
a strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a
major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired
business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue,
would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
Strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for its
assessment and management include the development of business plans, which
are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the Board of
Directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and
product proposals. The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is
difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical
earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to
help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and
control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with
oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and
internal risk management processes.
Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial
flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital
adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own
internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by
banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge
above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all
other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to
the required minimum of 3.0% under the Basel III final rule. If we fail to exceed any
regulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions
(depending upon the extent of the shortfall) regarding capital distributions and
discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a
bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not
be subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 112 to 121 included
under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations,
are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. We are also subject to the final market
risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators.
The Basel III rule provides two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy:
the “standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches", applicable to
advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach
prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA, including specified risk
weights for on and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches
consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of
credit risk RWA, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation
of operational risk RWA.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in 2010, we and State Street Bank, as advanced
approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to
as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy,
such that our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the
lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized
approach. Under the advanced approaches, State Street and State Street Bank are
subject to a 2.5% CCB requirement, plus any applicable countercyclical capital
buffer requirement, which is currently set at 0%. Under the standardized approach,
State Street Bank is subject to the same CCB and countercyclical capital buffer
requirements, but for State Street, the 2.5% CCB requirement is replaced by the
SCB requirement according to the SCB rule issued in 2020. In addition, State Street
is subject to a G-SIB surcharge.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the CCB with a buffer
calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected
CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock
dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh
quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement can be no less than
2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other
State Street Corporation | 38
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.
On June 28, 2023, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from
the 2023 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2023 supervisory
stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor,
which went into effect starting October 1, 2023 and will remain effective through
September 30, 2024.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2024, include a CCB of
2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach,
respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This
results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2024, is 1.0%. Based
upon calculations using data as of December 31, 2023, our G-SIB surcharge will
remain at 1% through December 31, 2025.
To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company,
we and our IDI subsidiaries are required, among other requirements, to be "well
capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily
measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading
positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR
measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public
disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market
risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR
measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is
provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
On July 27, 2023, U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement
the Basel III endgame (Basel III Endgame Proposal) for large banks, and separately
proposed revisions to the U.S. G-SIB capital surcharge framework (G-SIB
Surcharge Proposal). The Basel III Endgame Proposal would, among other things,
eliminate the advanced approaches for risk-based capital adequacy in favor of a
new standardized expanded risk-based approach that would include, unlike the
current standardized approach, operational risk and CVA risk RWA components,
and would also replace the existing market risk rule with the new fundamental
review of the trading book (FRTB) framework. The G-SIB
Surcharge Proposal would, among other things, measure the G-SIB surcharge in
more granular 0.1% increments as opposed to the 0.5% increments that currently
apply.
The Basel III Endgame Proposal would maintain the current Basel III rule’s
dual-requirement structure, whereby we and State Street Bank would be required to
calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the expanded risk-based approach
and the standardized approach. In addition, the proposal would modify the existing
standardized approach by requiring that the proposed new market risk standards,
FRTB, also be applied in the standardized approach.
The Basel III Endgame Proposal would apply the SCB and G-SIB surcharge to
the risk-based capital requirements calculated under both the expanded risk-based
approach and the existing standardized approach. The Basel III Endgame Proposal
includes an effective date of July 1, 2025, with a three-year transition arrangement
until the requirements are fully phased in on July 1, 2028. The G-SIB Surcharge
Proposal is set to be implemented two calendar quarters after the date of the
adoption of the final rule, which is currently to be determined.
Based on our current understanding of the Basel III Endgame Proposal, we
estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had been applied on a fully
phased-in basis as of December 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions
to mitigate its impact, our expanded risk-based approach RWA as of that date would
have been approximately 15% higher than our actual standardized approach RWA
as of that date.
Any estimate of how the expanded risk-based approach may impact us is
subject to uncertainty, as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and
may be materially affected by and dependent on a range of factors, including
business performance, future capital actions, the results of future supervisory stress
tests, and interpretations (including changes in interpretations) of, and potential
modifications by the U.S. Agencies to, the proposal.

Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Other adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include AOCI hedges that are not recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit riskbased deductions.
Under the advanced approaches, credit risk RWA includes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.
Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial
condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory
review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%. On June 28, 2023, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2023
supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under the 2023 supervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will be in effect from October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.

 Not applicable
As of March 31, 2024, total advanced approaches RWA increased $4.71 billion compared to December 31, 2023, mainly due to an increase in operational risk RWA. The
increase in operational risk RWA was primarily due to a model recalibration driven largely by an increase in the value of losses.
As of March 31, 2024, total standardized approach RWA increased $6.91 billion compared to December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the expected normalization of RWA. The
increase in RWA mainly reflects higher derivatives RWA, driven by increased volumes, higher repo-style transaction RWA, due to increased volumes and higher equity market levels,
and higher loans RWA, driven by new capital call commitments, partially offset by other RWA, such as cash and stable value wrap.
The regulatory capital ratios as of March 31, 2024, presented in Table 32: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the
advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with
respect to our capital and related matters as of March 31, 2024, based on our internal and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and
assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-
Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may
not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events
experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing
regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a
material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods.
An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the
severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation
to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us
or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will
change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III
final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

Tier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR. The Tier 1
leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance
sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the
denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet
assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

Tier 1 leverage ratios were calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule.
The SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well
capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0%
to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject
to a well capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The Federal Reserve's final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company
requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, is intended to improve the
resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced
prudential standards, and requires us, among other things, to comply with minimum
requirements for external TLAC (combined eligible tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD)
and LTD. Specifically, we must hold:
Amount equal to:
External TLAC
Greater of:
• 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus 2.5% plus a G- SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable countercyclical
buffer, which is currently 0%); and
• 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the
SLR buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the SLR final rule.
Qualifying external LTD
Greater of:
• 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB surcharge
calculated for these purposes under method 2 of 1.0%);
and
• 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR
final rule.

Common Stock
On January 19, 2024, we announced a new common share repurchase program, approved by our Board and superseding all prior programs, authorizing the purchase of up to
$5.0 billion of our common stock beginning in the first quarter of 2024. This new program has no set expiration date and is not expected to be executed in full during 2024. We
repurchased $100 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2024 under our 2024 share repurchase authorization.
The table below presents the activity under our common share repurchase program for the periods indicated:

Federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the
authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to pages 58 to 60 in "Related
Stockholder Matters" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and pages 167 to 169
in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof,
are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.
Stock purchases under our common share repurchase program may be made using various types of transactions, including open market purchases, accelerated share
repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing and amount of any stock purchases and the type of transaction
may not be ratable over the duration of the program, may vary from reporting period to reporting period and will depend on several factors, including our capital position and our
financial performance, investment opportunities, market conditions, the nature and timing of implementation of revisions to the Basel III framework and the amount of common stock
issued as part of employee compensation programs. The common share repurchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our
clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of
these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $326.37 billion and
$279.92 billion as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of
the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement
of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the
borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $341.90 billion and $293.86 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively.
State Street Corporation | 45
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we
indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100%
of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated
statement of condition. Of the collateral of $341.90 billion and $293.86 billion, referenced above, $69.20 billion and $59.03 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements
as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We or our agents held $73.98 billion and $63.11 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase
agreements as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
Additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 7, 9 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q.
OTHER MATTERS
Closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and Related FDIC Matters
In March 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank and the appointment of the FDIC as the receiver for those banks, the FDIC announced
that, under the systemic risk exception set forth in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), all insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the respective
bridge banks for SVB and Signature Bank. The FDIC also announced that, as required by the FDIA, any losses to the DIF to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a
special assessment.
In November 2023, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the protection of
uninsured depositors following the closure of SVB and Signature Bank. At that time the FDIC determined that the total special assessment for those purposes was $16.3 billion,
which is approximately equal to the FDIC’s then current estimate of losses to the DIF attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at SVB and Signature Bank. In February
2024, the FDIC disclosed that its estimate of those losses to the DIF had increased. The FDIC will ultimately determine the exact amount of losses incurred when it terminates the
receiverships of these two banks, and the amount of the special assessment will be adjusted as the loss estimates change. For IDIs such as State Street Bank, the special
assessment will be applied at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points multiplied by the IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits, reported as of December 31, 2022 and adjusted to exclude
the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, although the collection period
may change as a result of updates to the estimated loss, subsequent to the original estimate, pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments collected change due to
corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022 reporting period. The final rule is effective on April 1, 2024, with the first collection
for the special assessment reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024), with a payment date of June 28, 2024.
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a pre-tax expense within other expenses of approximately $387 million, reflecting State Street Bank’s allocation of the special
assessment at that time, consistent with the calculation methodology noted above. In the first quarter of 2024, we recognized an additional pre-tax expense within other expenses of
approximately $130 million primarily reflecting the FDIC's February 2024 disclosed increase to its estimate of losses to the DIF. The total expense for the special assessment
remains subject to any actions by the FDIC, as described above, to cease collection early, extend the special assessment period, or impose a one-time final shortfall special
assessment, including as a result of updates to the estimated losses, subsequent to the original estimate.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information related to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our management carried out an evaluation, with the
participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of March 31, 2024.
We have established and maintain internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, we routinely enhance our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to our internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, no change occurred in our internal control over financial
reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
