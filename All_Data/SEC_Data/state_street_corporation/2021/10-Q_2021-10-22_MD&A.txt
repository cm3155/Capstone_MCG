GENERAL
State Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial
holding  company  organized  in  1969  under  the  laws  of  the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston,
Massachusetts  02111  (telephone  (617)  786-3000).  For  purposes  of  this
Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  for  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2021
(Form  10-Q),  unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  references  to  "State
Street," "we," "us," "our" or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its
subsidiaries  on  a  consolidated  basis.  The  Parent  Company  is  a  source  of
financial and managerial strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries,
including  our  principal  banking  subsidiary,  State  Street  Bank  and  Trust
Company,  referred  to  as  State  Street  Bank,  we  provide  a  broad  range  of
financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide, with $43.34
trillion of AUC/A and $3.86 trillion of AUM as of September 30, 2021.
As of September  30, 2021, we had consolidated total assets  of $323.14
billion,  consolidated  total  deposits  of  $259.37  billion,  consolidated  total
shareholders'  equity  of  $27.31  billion  and  38,932  employees.  We  operate  in
more  than  100  geographic  markets  worldwide,  including  in  the  U.S.,  Canada,
Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Our  operations  are  organized  into  two  lines  of  business,  Investment
Servicing  and Investment  Management,  which are  defined  based  on products
and services provided.
Additional  information  about  our  lines  of  business  is  provided  in  Line  of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note
17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis is part of the Form 10-Q and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2020 Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 previously filed with the
SEC (2020 Form 10-K). You should read the financial information contained in
this Management's Discussion and Analysis and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q in
conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our 2020 Form10-K.  Certain  previously  reported  amounts  presented  in  this  Form  10-Q  have
been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP.  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materiallyaffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.The  significant  accounting  policies  that  require  us  to  make  judgments,estimates  and  assumptions  that  are  difficult,  subjective  or  complex  aboutmatters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:• accounting for fair value measurements; • impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;• contingencies; and• allowance for credit losses.
These  significant  accounting  policies  require  the  most  subjective  orcomplex  judgments,  and  underlying  estimates  and  assumptions  could  besubject  to  revision  as  new  information  becomes  available.  For  additionalinformation  about  these  significant  accounting  policies  refer  to  pages  123  to125, “Significant  Accounting  Estimates”  included under Item  7, Management'sDiscussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  inour 2020 Form 10-K. We did not change these significant accounting policies inthe first nine months of 2021.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including in thisManagement's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, orreported  basis,  and  a  non-GAAP  basis.  We  measure  and  compare  certainfinancial  information  on  a  non-GAAP  basis,  including  information  thatmanagement  uses  in  evaluating  our  business  and  activities.  Non-GAAPfinancial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitutefor or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP.Any non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, including thisManagement’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,  is  reconciled  to  its  most  directlycomparable U.S. GAAP-basis measure.
We further believe that our presentation of FTE NII, a non-GAAP measure,which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with taxexempt  investment  securities,  on  a  FTE  basis,  facilitates  an  investor'sunderstanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.We provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatorystandards,  including supplemental  qualitative and quantitative  information  withrespect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our tradingactivities) and the LCR, summary results of semi-annual State StreetState Street Corporation | 4

reports, as applicable) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within
the meaning of U.S. securities laws, including statements about our goals and
expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of
operations,  strategies,  cost savings and transformation  initiatives,  investment
portfolio  performance,  dividend  and  stock  purchase  programs,  outcomes  of
legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures,
client  growth  and  new  technologies,  services  and  opportunities,  as  well  as

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe  following  “Financial  Results  and  Highlights”  section  provides
information  related  to  significant  events,  as  well  as  highlights  of  our
consolidated financial results for the third quarter of 2021 presented in Table 1:
Overview of Financial Results. More detailed information about our consolidated
financial results, including the comparison of our financial results for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in
2020, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line of Business
Information"  and  "Capital"  which  follows  these  sections,  as  well  as  in  our
consolidated  financial  statements  in  this  Form  10-Q.  In  this  Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in foreign
currency  translation,  those  effects  are  determined  by  applying  applicable
weighted average FX rates from the relevant 2020 period to the relevant 2021
period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Third quarter of 2021 financial performance: ◦ EPS of $1.96 in the third quarter of 2021, up 35%, from $1.45
in the same period in 2020. ◦ Total  fee  revenue  was  up  9%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021,
compared to the same period in 2020, including less than 1%due to currency translation. ◦ Servicing fee revenues were up 7% in the third quarter of 2021,
compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020.  Management  fee
revenues were up 10% in the third quarter of 2021, compared
to the same period in 2020. ◦ In  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  return  on  equity  of  11.6%increased from 8.9% in the same period in 2020, primarily due
to  an  increase  in  net  income  available  to  common
shareholders.  Pre-tax  margin  of  29.3%  in  the  third  quarter  of
2021  increased  from  24.5%  in  the  same  period  in  2020,
primarily due to an increase in total revenue. ◦ Operating  leverage  was  6.8%  points  in  the  third  quarter  of
2021.  Operating  leverage  represents  the  difference  between
the  percentage  change  in  total  revenue  and  the  percentage
change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year
period.
• In September 2021, we announced that we had entered into a definitiveagreement  to  acquire  the  BBH  Investor  Services  business  for$3.5 billion in cash. This proposed acquisition is subject to regulatoryapprovals and the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions.◦ We  expect  to  finance  the  proposed  acquisition  of  the  BBHInvestor  Services  business  primarily  with  the  proceeds  of$1.9  billion  from  a  common  stock  offering  completed  inSeptember  2021,  a  temporary  suspension  of  repurchases  ofour common stock and with cash on hand.• During  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  our  business  and  financial  resultscontinued to reflect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic:◦ Approximately 77% of our employees globally continue to workremotely as of September 30, 2021.◦ We continued to experience high levels of client deposits in thethird  quarter  of  2021  amidst  the  Federal  Reserve'sexpansionary monetary policy.
Revenue
• Total revenue increased 7% in the third quarter of 2021, compared tothe same period in 2020. Total fee revenue increased 9% in the thirdquarter  of  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  driven  byincreases across all categories of fee revenue.• Servicing  fee  revenue  increased  7%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021,compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher averageequity  market  levels,  client  activity  and  flows,  and  net  new  business,partially offset by normal pricing headwinds. • Management fee revenue increased 10% in the third quarter of 2021,compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher averageequity  market  levels  and  net  inflows  from  ETFs,  partially  offset  byidiosyncratic  actions  by  an  institutional  client,  as  previously  reported,and higher money market fee waivers. • Foreign exchange trading services increased 3% in the third quarter of2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  higherdirect sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset bylower FX volatility.
State Street Corporation | 8
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS• Securities finance revenue increased 26% in the third quarter of 2021,
compared to the same period in 2020, reflecting higher client securities
loan balances and spreads, as well as new business wins in enhanced
custody. • Software  and  processing  fees  revenue  increased  15%  in  the  third
quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to
higher CRD revenues. • NII  increased  2%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  compared  to  the  same
period in 2020, primarily due to higher loan balances and growth in the
investment  portfolio  and  deposits,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  a
$20 million non-recurring  true-up  in the third quarter of 2020, partially
offset by lower investment portfolio yields.
Provision for Credit Losses
• The provision for credit losses was a $2 million reserve release in the
third quarter of 2021, compared to no provision for credit losses in the
same  period  in  2020,  which  is  primarily  driven  by  improvements  in
credit quality and stable economic outlook.
Expenses
• Total expenses increased 1% in the third quarter of 2021, compared to
the same period in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of notable items
and  currency  translation.  Currency  translation  increased  expenses  by
less than 1% in the third quarter of 2021, relative to the same period in
2020. • The  impact  of  notable  items  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021  includes
acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  of  approximately  $18  million,  of
which $11 million related to CRD and $7 million related to our proposed
acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business. • The  impact  of  notable  items  in  the  third  quarter  of  2020  includes
acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  of  approximately  $15  million,
primarily related to CRD, and a $9 million accrual release.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A  of  $43.34  trillion  increased  18%  as  of  September  30,  2021,
compared  to  September  30,  2020,  primarily  due  to  higher  market
levels, client flows and net new business growth. In the third quarter of
2021,  newly  announced  asset  servicing  mandates  totaled
approximately  $1.66  trillion,  with  State  Street  Alpha representing  a
large proportion of the wins. Servicing assets
remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $2.73trillion as of September 30, 2021. • AUM  of  $3.86  trillion  increased  23%  as  of  September  30,  2021,compared to September 30, 2020, primarily due to higher market levelsand net inflows from ETFs and cash, partially offset by institutional netoutflows.
Capital • In the third quarter of 2021, we returned a total of approximately $179million to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends paid.• We  declared  common  stock  dividends  of  $0.57  per  share,  totaling$209 million in the third quarter of 2021 to be paid in the fourth quarterof 2021, compared to $0.52 per share, totaling $184 million in the thirdquarter of 2020, representing a 10% increase on a per share basis fromthe third quarter of 2020. • In July 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase plan ofup  to  $3.0  billion  of  our  common  stock  through  the  end  of  2022,however,  in  connection  with  our  proposed  acquisition  of  the  BBHInvestor Services business, we did not repurchase any common stockduring the third  quarter  of 2021. We do not intend to repurchase  anycommon stock during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of2022. We intend to resume our common share repurchases during thesecond quarter of 2022. • In  September  2021,  we  completed  a  public  offering  of  approximately21.7 million shares of our common stock. The offering price was $87.60per  share  and  net  proceeds  totaled  approximately  $1.9  billion.  Weexpect to use these net proceeds to finance our proposed acquisition ofthe BBH Investor Services business. • Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 13.5% as of September 30, 2021,compared to 12.3% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to higherretained  earnings  and  the  issuance  of  common  stock  in  September2021,  partially  offset  by  higher  risk-weighted  assets.  Our  Tier  1leverage ratio decreased to 6.3% as of September 30, 2021 comparedto 6.4% as of December 31, 2020. Following the planned closing of ouracquisition  of  the  BBH  Investor  Services  business,  we  expect  bothcapital ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges of 10-11% forCET1 ratio andSM  State Street Corporation | 9
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS5.25%-5.75% for Tier 1 Leverage ratio . As of both September 30, 2021
and December 31, 2020, standardized capital ratios were binding.

Fee Revenue
Table 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the threeand  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021  and  2020.  Servicing  andmanagement fees collectively made up approximately 77% and 76% of the totalfee  revenue  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,respectively,  compared  to  77%  and  74%  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,respectively.
Servicing Fee RevenueGenerally,  our  servicing  fee  revenues  are  affected  by  several  factorsincluding changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net newbusiness and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range ofservices  to  our  clients,  including  core  custody  services,  accounting,  reportingand  administration  and  middle  office  services,  and  the  nature  and  mix  ofservices provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ acrossregions and clients.
Changes in Market ValuationsOur  servicing  fee  revenue  is  impacted  by  both  our  levels  and  thegeographic  and  product  mix  of  our  AUC/A.  Increases  or  decreases  in  marketvaluations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicingfee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset typesand  classes  and  geography  of  assets  held  within  our  clients’  portfolios.  Forcertain  asset  classes  where  the  valuation  process  is  more  complex,  includingalternative  investments,  or  where  our  valuation  is  dependent  on  third  partyinformation, AUC/A is reported on a lag, typically one-month. For those assetclasses,  the  impact  of  market  levels  on  our  reported  AUC/A  does  not  reflectcurrent period-end market levels.
Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that worldwidemarket valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)%to  5%  annually.  See  Table  3:  Daily  Averages,  Month-End  Averages  andQuarter-End  Equity  Indices  for  selected  indices.  While  the  specific  indicespresented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classesrelevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance ofassociated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from theperformance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications maydiffer from those industry classifications presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAssuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity and asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of September 30, 2021that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, wouldresult in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all otherfactors constant and using relevant information as of September 30, 2021, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and overtime are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades,and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a numberof factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over thefive years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 2% annually.See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classesrelevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industryclassifications presented.

Net New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually. Gross investment servicing mandates were $1.66 trillion in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.3 trillion per year on averageover the past five years. Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from $750 billion to nearly $2.0 trillion.New business impacting  servicing  fees  can include: custody;  product  accounting;  daily valuation and administration;  record-keeping;  cash management;  and otherservices. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types ofassets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, canrange from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately  9 to 12 months  over the 2 years ended December  31, 2020. Our more complexinstallations, including new State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range. With respect to the current asset mandates of approximately$2.73 trillion that are yet to be installed as of September 30, 2021, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 12 to 24 months, with approximately half of theannualized revenue expected to be recognized through 2022, and the remainder primarily in 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSPricing
The industry  in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure,
and  our  servicing  fee  revenues  are  also  affected  by  such  pressures  today.
Consequently,  no  assumption  should  be  drawn  as  to  future  revenue  run  rate
from  announced  servicing  wins,  as  the  amount  of  revenue  associated  with
AUC/A  can  vary  materially.  On  average,  over  the  five  years  ended
December 31, 2020, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing
clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the
impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year. Pricing concessions can be
a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit
us,  such as extending  the terms  of our relationship  with the client,  expanding
the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual
processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of
the  impact  of  additional  revenue  generated  by  anticipated  additional  services,
and  the  amount  of  revenue  generated,  may  differ  from  the  impact  of  pricing
concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard
those  new  services,  the  nature  of  those  services  and  client  investment
practices.  These  same  market  pressures  also  impact  the  fees  we  negotiate
when we win business from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds,
we estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year; although,
notwithstanding  increases  in  AUC/A,  servicing  fees  remain  subject  to  several
factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows,
the  manner  in  which  we  price  our  services,  the  nature  of  the  assets  being
serviced  and the  type  of  services  and the  other  factors  described  in Item  1A,
"Risk Factors", in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Historically,  and  based  on  an  indicative  sample  of  revenue,  we  estimate
that approximately 55%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been
variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average
valuations  of  AUC/A;  another  15%,  on  average,  of  our  servicing  fees  are
impacted  by  the  volume  of  activity  in  the  funds  we  serve;  and  the  remaining
approximately 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor
impacted by market fluctuations or values.
Based on the impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new
business  and  pricing,  noted  drivers  of  our  servicing  fee  revenue  will  vary
depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The
full  impact  of  changes  in  market  valuations  and  the  volume  of  activity  in  the
funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in
which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.
Management Fee RevenueManagement  fees  generally  are  affected  by  our  level  of  AUM,  which  wereport  based  on  month-end  valuations.  Management  fees  for  certaincomponents of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and UCITS, areaffected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is moresensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportionof  the  underlying  services  provided,  and  the  associated  management  feesearned,  are  dependent  on  equity  and  fixed-income  security  valuations.Additional  factors,  such  as  the  relative  mix  of  assets  managed,  may  have  asignificant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain managementfees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategiesemployed,  management  fees  may  reflect  other  factors,  including  performancefee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients. In addition, in aprolonged low-interest rate environment, such as we are currently experiencing,we  have  waived  and  may  in  the  future  waive  certain  fees  for  our  clients  formoney market products.
The impact of State Street Global Advisors gross money market fund feewaivers on total management fee revenue was approximately $20 million in thethird quarter of 2021. As of September 30, 2021, and assuming short-term spotinterest rates and the amount of money market fund assets remain constant, weestimate  that  the  impact  of  gross  money  market  fee  waivers  on  ourmanagement  fees  would be approximately  $20 million in the fourth  quarter  of2021.  We  believe  that  a  further  decline  in  short-term  interest  rates,  primarilyone- and three-month interest rates, would not materially impact this estimate.Alternatively,  if  short-term  interest  rates  were  to  rise  by  approximately  10bps,the impact of gross money market fee waivers on our management fees wouldbe largely mitigated in the subsequent quarterly periods.Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to whichour AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee onAUM than for actively managed products. Actively managed products may alsoinclude  performance  fee  arrangements  which  are  recorded  when  the  fee  isearned,  based  on  predetermined  benchmarks  associated  with  the  applicableaccount's performance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn  light  of  the  above,  we  estimate,  using  relevant  information  as  of
September  30,  2021  and  assuming  that  all  other  factors  remain  constant,
including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that: • A  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  worldwide  equity  valuations,  on  a
weighted  average  basis,  over  the  relevant  periods  for  which  our
management  fees  are  calculated,  would  result  in  a  corresponding
change  in  our  total  management  fee  revenues,  on  average  and  over
multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and
• We  estimate,  similarly  assuming  all  other  factors  constant  and  using
relevant  information  as  of  September  30,  2021,  that  changes  in
worldwide  fixed  income  markets,  which  on  a  weighted  average  basis
and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets,
will  have  a  smaller  impact  on  our  management  fee  revenues  on
average and over time.
Daily averages, month-end averages and quarter-end indices demonstrate
worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee
revenue. Quarter-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See
Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices
for selected indices.
Additional  information  about  fee  revenue  is  provided  under  "Line  of
Business Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See  Table  2:  Total  Revenue,  for  the  breakout  of  interest  income  and
interest  expense  for  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,
compared to the same periods in 2020.
NII  is  defined  as  interest  income  earned  on  interest-earning  assets  less
interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets,
which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with
banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily
by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average
total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by
average  interest-earning  assets.  Revenue  that  is  exempt  from  income  taxes,
mainly  earned  from  certain  investment  securities  (state  and  political
subdivisions),  is  adjusted  to  a  FTE  basis  using  the  U.S.  federal  and  state
statutory income tax rates.
NII on an FTE basis increased in the three months ended September 30,
2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher loan
balances  and  growth  in  the  investment  portfolio  and  deposits,  as  well  as  theabsence of a non-recurring true-up in the third quarter of 2020, partially offset bylower investment portfolio yields.
NII on an FTE basis decreased in the nine months ended September 30,2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to lower investmentportfolio yields, partially offset by deposit, investment portfolio and loan growth,and the absence of a non-recurring true-up in the third quarter of 2020.Investment  securities  net  premium  amortization,  which  is  included  ininterest income, was $128 million and $454 million in the three and nine monthsended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  $179  million  and$396 million in the same periods in 2020, respectively.  The decrease in MBSpremium  amortization  in  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2021,compared to the same period in 2020, is primarily driven by lower prepaymentsand the absence of a non-recurring true-up of $20 million, which impacted thethird  quarter  of  2020.  The  increase  in  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,2021, compared to the same period in 2020, is primarily driven by low level ofinterest rates and the absence of the MMLF discount accretion.Interest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidatedstatement  of  income  using  the  effective  interest  method,  or  on  a  basisapproximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of thesecurity. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as wellas  purchase  premiums  or  discounts,  resulting  in  amortization  or  accretion,accordingly.  The  amortization  of  premiums  and  accretion  of  discounts  areadjusted  for  prepayments  when  they  occur,  which  primarily  impact  mortgagebacked securities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSChanges in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities  are  discussed  in  more  detail  below.  Additional  information  about  the
components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to
the consolidated financial statements within this Form 10-Q.
Average  total  interest-earning  assets  were  $254.50  billion  and  $258.42
billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,
compared  to $225.81 billion and $225.74 billion in the same  periods  in 2020,
respectively.  The  increase  is  primarily  due  to  higher  interest-bearing  deposits
with  banks,  investment  securities,  loans  and  other  interest-  earning  assets,
partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  investment  securities  purchased  under  the
MMLF facility.
Interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  averaged  $79.38  billion  and  $91.29
billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,
compared  to  $72.72  billion  and  $75.52  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,
respectively. These deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances
at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S.
central banks. The higher levels of average cash balances with central banks
reflect higher levels of client deposits.
Securities  repurchased  under  resale  agreements  averaged  $4.06  billion
and  $4.19  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,
respectively, compared to $4.18 billion and $3.11 billion in the same periods in
2020,  respectively.  The  impact  of  balance  sheet  netting  decreased  to  $52.17
billion  and  $66.92  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,
2021, respectively, compared to $83.48 billion and $103.46 billion in the same
periods  in  2020,  respectively.  We  maintain  an  agreement  with  Fixed  Income
Clearing  Corporation  (FICC),  a  clearing  organization  that  enables  us  to  net
securities sold under repurchase agreements against those repurchased under
resale  agreements  with  counterparties  that  are  also  members  of  the  clearing
organization,  when  specific  netting  criteria  are  met.  The  decrease  in  average
balance sheet netting in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021,
compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2020,  is  primarily  due  to  lower  FICC  repo
volumes  from  an  increased  cash  supply  and  lower  short-term  interest  rates
driven by extensive Federal Reserve stimulus.
We have been a sponsoring member within FICC since 2005 and continue
to expand our client base as program eligibility parameters broaden. We enter
into  repurchase  and  resale  transactions  in  eligible  securities  with  sponsored
clients  and  with  other  FICC  members  and,  pursuant  to  FICC  Government
Securities Division rules, submit, novate
and  net  the  transactions.  We  may  sponsor  clients  to  clear  their  eligiblerepurchase  transactions  with  FICC,  backed  by  our  guarantee  to  FICC  of  theprompt  and  full  payment  and  performance  of  our  sponsored  member  clients’respective  obligations.  We  generally  obtain  a  security  interest  from  oursponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive, whichis designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.Average investment securities were $113.64 billion and $111.00 billion, inthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, including$420 million MMLF securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2021,compared  to  $110.45  billion  and  $108.22  billion,  including  $7.49  billion  and$9.52 billion MMLF securities, in the same periods in 2020, respectively. We didnot have any MMLF securities in the three months ended September 30, 2021.Average  investment  securities,  excluding  MMLF  HTM  securities,  increased  to$113.64  billion  and  $110.58  billion  in  the  three  and  nine  months  endedSeptember  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  $102.96  billion  and$98.70 billion in the same periods in 2020, respectively, primarily driven by U.S.Treasuries, CMBS balances and foreign government bonds. The growth reflectsour deployment of higher structural deposit levels that resulted from the COVID19 pandemic.
Loans  averaged  $32.04  billion  and  $29.86  billion  in  the  three  and  ninemonths  ended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  $25.97  billionand  $27.27  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively.  Average  coreloans,  which  exclude  overdrafts  and  highlight  our  efforts  to  grow  our  lendingportfolio,  averaged  $28.41  billion  and  $25.92  billion  in  the  three  and  ninemonths  ended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  $22.54  billionand $22.42 billion in the same periods in 2020, respectively. The increases inboth periods are primarily due to growth in CLOs in loan form and fund financeloans.  Additional  information  about  these  loans  is  provided  in  Note  4  to  theconsolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average  other  interest-earning  assets,  largely  associated  with  ourenhanced custody business, increased to $24.66 billion and $21.32 billion in thethree  and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  from  $11.59billion  and  $10.73  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively,  primarilydriven by an increase in the level of cash collateral posted. Enhanced custody isour securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to ourcustody  clients  and  generate  securities  finance  revenue.  The  NII  earned  onthese  transactions  is  generally  lower  than  the  interest  earned  on  otheralternative investments.
State Street Corporation | 16
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAggregate  average  total  interest-bearing  deposits  increased  to  $186.81
billion and $186.60 billion in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2021, respectively, from $154.95 billion and $152.55 billion in the same periods
in  2020,  respectively.  Average  U.S.  interest-bearing  deposits  increased  as  a
result of the market uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. monetary
policy  and  the  level  of  global  interest  rates.  We  expect  deposits  to  remain
elevated  within  the  current  environment  of  low  interest  rates  and  continued
expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve, but modestly reduced
from third quarter of 2021 levels. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the
underlying  asset  servicing  business,  client  deposit  behavior  and  market
conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings decreased to $0.84 billion and $0.83
billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,
from  $1.72 billion and $2.58 billion in the same  periods  in 2020, respectively.
The decrease is primarily due to lower borrowings from the FHLB in the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in
2020.
Average long-term debt was $13.02 billion and $13.43 billion in the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $14.79
billion  and  $14.55  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively.  These
amounts reflect issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the
respective periods.
Average  other  interest-bearing  liabilities  were  $5.46  billion  and  $5.33
billion in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively,
compared  to  $2.76  billion  and  $3.22  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,
respectively.  Other  interest-bearing  liabilities  primarily  reflect  our  level  of  cash
collateral  received  from  clients  in  connection  with  our  enhanced  custody
business, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting
agreements.
Several  factors  could  affect  future  levels  of  NII  and  NIM,  including  the
volume  and  mix  of  client  deposits  and  funding  sources;  central  bank  actions;
balance  sheet  management  activities;  changes  in  the  level  and  slope  of  U.S.
and  non-U.S.  interest  rates;  revised  or  proposed  regulatory  capital  or  liquidity
standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities
purchased  compared  to  the  yields  earned  on  securities  sold  or  matured;  and
changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.
Based  on  market  conditions  and  other  factors,  including  regulatory
standards, we continue to
reinvest  the  majority  of  the  proceeds  from  pay-downs  and  maturities  ofinvestment  securities  in  highly-rated  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  securities,  such  asfederal agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agencysecurities. The pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securitiespurchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementationof  regulatory  standards,  including  interpretation  of  those  standards  and  otherfactors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest ratesto impact our reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.Provision for Credit LossesThere was a $2 million reserve release for the provision for credit losses inthe  third  quarter  of  2021,  which  is  primarily  driven  by  improvements  in  creditquality and stable economic outlook. We recorded no provision for credit lossesin the third quarter of 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCompensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 1% in the third
quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher
salary deferrals and lower headcount, partially offset by higher medical benefits
costs. Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 2% in the nine
months  ended  September  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,
primarily  due  to  currency  translation  and  higher  seasonal  expenses,  partially
offset  by  lower  headcount  in  high  cost  locations  and  incentive  compensation.
Currency translation increased compensation and employee benefits by 2% in
the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in
2020.
Total  headcount  was  flat  as  of  September  30,  2021  compared  to
September  30,  2020,  primarily  driven  by  hiring  in  global  hubs,  offset  by  a
reduction in high cost locations.
Information  systems  and communications  expenses  increased  3% in the
third  quarter  of  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to
higher  technology  and  infrastructure  investments.  Information  systems  and
communications expenses increased 6% in the nine months ended September
30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  related  to  higher
software  costs,  technology  infrastructure  investments  and  notable  items,
partially  offset  by  transformation  initiatives.  Currency  translation  increased
information systems and communications expenses by 1% in the nine months
ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020.
Transaction  processing  services  expenses  increased  8%  and  9%  in  the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to
the same periods in 2020, primarily due to higher sub-custody costs and market
data fees. Currency translation increased transaction processing services and
communications  expenses  by  2%  in  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,
2021, compared to the same period in 2020.
Occupancy expenses decreased 6% and 5% in the three and nine months
ended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in
2020,  primarily  due  to  footprint  optimization.  Currency  translation  increased
occupancy  expenses  by  2%  in  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,
compared to the same period in 2020.
Amortization of other intangible assets increased 5% in both the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020,
primarily due to the lift-out in the first quarter of 2021 of the depository bank and
fund  administrator  activities  of  Fideuram  Bank  Luxembourg,  a  subsidiary  of
Intesa Sanpaolo.
Other expenses decreased 3% in the third quarter of 2021, compared tothe  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  driven  by  lower  sub-advisor  costs  andmarketing costs, partially offset by the absence of notable items from the thirdquarter  of  2020.  Other  expenses  decreased  9%  in  the  nine  months  endedSeptember  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  tolower securities processing losses, professional services and travel costs.Acquisition CostsWe recorded approximately $11 million and $33 million of acquisition costsin  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,compared  to  $15  million  and  $38  million  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,respectively,  related  to our acquisition  of CRD. As we integrate  CRD into ourbusiness,  we  expect  to  incur  up  to  approximately  $225  million  in  total  ofacquisition costs for the period beginning the last quarter of 2018 through 2021,after which we will no longer distinguish certain CRD costs as acquisition costs.As  of  September  30,  2021,  we  have  incurred  a  total  of  $197  million  ofacquisition costs related to CRD.
In addition, we recorded approximately $7 million of acquisition costs in thethird  quarter  of  2021  related  to  our  proposed  acquisition  of  the  BBH  InvestorServices business. We expect to incur up to approximately $590 million of totalacquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition through the third yearfollowing its closing.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIncome Tax Expense
Income  tax  expense  was  $162  million  and  $445  million  in  the  three  and
nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $126 million
and  $375  million  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively.  Our  effective  tax
rate was 18.5% and 18.2% in the three and nine months ended September 30,
2021, respectively, compared to 18.5% and 16.6% in the same periods in 2020,
respectively.  The  increase  in  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021
compared to the same period in 2020, is primarily due to lower benefits from tax
credit investments.

Servicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 7% and 8% in the three and nine months ended September 30,2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020, respectively, primarily due to higher average equity market levels, client activity and flows, and net new business,partially offset by normal pricing headwinds. Currency translation increased servicing fees by 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the sameperiod in 2020.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 48% of total servicing fees in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared toapproximately 47% and 46% in the same periods in 2020, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAsset  servicing  mandates  newly  announced  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021
totaled approximately $1.66 trillion, with State Street Alpha representing a large
proportion  of  the  wins.  Servicing  assets  remaining  to  be  installed  in  future
periods totaled approximately $2.73 trillion as of September 30, 2021, which will
be  reflected  in  AUC/A  in  future  periods  after  installation  and  will  generate
servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such
mandates will be realized over several quarters as the assets are installed and
additional services are added over that period. With respect to the current asset
mandates  of  approximately  $2.73  trillion  that  are  yet  to  be  installed  as  of
September 30, 2021, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 12 to
24 months, with approximately half of the annualized revenue expected to be
recognized through 2022, and the remainder primarily in 2023.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive
agreements,  approval  of  applicable  boards  and  shareholders  and  customary
regulatory  approvals.  New  asset  servicing  mandates  and  servicing  assets
remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which
has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to
publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter.
These  excluded  assets,  which  from  time  to  time  may  be  significant,  will  be
included  in  new  asset  servicing  mandates  and  reflected  in  servicing  assets
remaining  to  be  installed  in  the  period  in  which  the  client  provides  its
permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed
in  future  periods  are  presented  on  a  gross  basis  and  therefore  also  do  not
include  the  impact  of  clients  who  have  notified  us  during  the  period  of  their
intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to
time be significant.
With  respect  to  these  new  servicing  mandates,  once  installed  we  may
provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance
reporting  and  monitoring,  custody,  depository  banking  services,  FX,  fund
administration,  hedge  fund  servicing,  middle  office  outsourcing,  performance
and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities
finance,  transfer  agency  and  wealth  management  services.  Revenues
associated  with  new  servicing  mandates  may  vary  based  on  the  breadth  of
services provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As  a  result  of  a  decision  to  diversify  providers,  one  of  our  large  asset
servicing  clients  has  advised us  it  expects  to  move  a significant  portion  of  its
ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending
necessary approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for
this client after this transition and for the client to
continue to be meaningful to our business. The transition is expected to begin in2022 but will principally occur in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2020,the  fee  revenue  associated  with  the  transitioning  assets  representedapproximately  1.5%  of  our  total  fee  revenue.  The  total  revenue  and  incomeimpact of this transition will depend upon a range of factors, including potentialgrowth  in  our  continuing  business  with  the  client  and  expense  reductionsassociated with the transition.
For additional information about the impact of worldwide equity and fixedincome  valuations  on  our  fee  revenue,  as  well  as  other  key  drivers  of  ourservicing  fee  revenue,  refer  to  "Fee  Revenue"  in  "Consolidated  Results  ofOperations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.Foreign Exchange Trading ServicesForeign  exchange  trading  services  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:Investment  Servicing  Line  of  Business  Results,  increased  6%  in  the  threemonths  ended  September  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,primarily due to higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes,partially  offset  by  lower  FX  volatility.  Foreign  exchange  trading  servicesrevenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:  Investment  Servicing  Line  of  BusinessResults,  decreased  13%  in  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,compared  to the  same  period  in 2020, primarily  due to lower  FX volatility,  ascompared to the high levels of volatility experienced in the first nine months of2020  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Foreign  exchange  trading  services  iscomposed  of  revenue  generated  by  FX  trading  and  revenue  generated  bybrokerage  and  other  trading  services,  which  made  up  66%  and  34%,respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in the third quarter of2021, compared to 61% and 39%, respectively, in the same period in 2020. Theimpact  of  gross  money  market  fund  fee  waivers  on  foreign  exchange  tradingservices was $15 million and $38 million in the three and nine months endedSeptember 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $2 million and $4 million in thesame periods in 2020, respectively.
We  primarily  earn  FX  trading  revenue  by  acting  as  a  principal  marketmaker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”• Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rateswith  clients  and  investment  managers  that  contact  our  trading  deskdirectly.  These  principal  market-making  activities  include  transactionsfor funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well asthose funds under custody with us.
State Street Corporation | 21
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS• Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which
we  are  the  funds'  custodian,  or  their  investment  managers,  routed  to
our FX desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute indirect
FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
Our  FX  trading  revenue  is  influenced  by  multiple  factors,  including:  the
volume  and  type  of  client  FX  transactions  and  related  spreads;  currency
volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate,
interest  rate  and  other  market  risks  associated  with  our  FX  activities.  The
relative  impact  of  these  factors  on  our  total  FX  trading  revenues  often  differs
from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant,
increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend
to  result  in  increases  or  decreases,  as  the  case  may  be,  in  client-related  FX
revenue. Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their
FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX
trading  to  either  direct  sales  and  trading  execution,  including  our  “Street  FX”
service,  or  to  one  of  our  electronic  trading  platforms.  Street  FX,  in  which  we
continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their
FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for
funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
We  also  earn  foreign  exchange  trading  services  revenue  through
"electronic  FX  services"  and  "other  trading,  transition  management  and
brokerage revenue."
• Electronic  FX  services:  Our  clients  may  choose  to  execute  FX
transactions  through  one  of  our  electronic  trading  platforms.  These
transactions generate revenue through a “click” fee. • Other  trading,  transition  management  and  brokerage  revenue:  As  our
clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may
choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or
transact  with  our  Equity  Trade  execution  group.  These  transactions,
which  are  not  limited  to  foreign  exchange,  generate  revenue  via
commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of
these portfolios.
Securities FinanceOur securities finance business consists of three components:(1)  an  agency  lending  program  for  State  Street  Global  Advisorsmanaged  investment  funds  with  a  broad  range  of  investmentobjectives,  which  we  refer  to  as  the  State  Street  Global  Advisorslending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers andasset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, whichwe refer to as our enhanced custody business.Securities  finance  revenue  earned  from  our  agency  lending  activities,which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral andthe fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume ofsecurities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlyingcollateral and our share of the fee split.
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from thelending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to thesubsequent borrower,  either our client or a broker/dealer.  We act  as principalwhen the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with themarket  and  execute  the  transaction  and  furnish  the  securities.  In  our  role  asprincipal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. Whilewe source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role asprincipal  from  third  parties,  we  have  the  ability  to  source  securities  throughassets  under  custody  from  clients  who  have  designated  us  as  an  eligibleborrower.
Securities  finance  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:  InvestmentServicing Line of Business Results, increased 27% in the three months endedSeptember 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven byhigher  client  securities  loan  balances  and  spreads,  as  well  as  new  businesswins  in  enhanced  custody.  Securities  finance  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 18% in the ninemonths  ended  September  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,primarily  driven  by  higher  agency  lending  and  enhanced  custody  balances,partially offset by lower spreads.
State Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSMarket  influences  may  continue  to  affect  client  demand  for  securities
finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities
lending activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory
environment,  including  revised  or  proposed  capital  and  liquidity  standards,
interpretations  of  those  standards,  and  our  own  balance  sheet  management
activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency
lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending
activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and
revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance, fees from our
structured  products  business  and  other  revenue  including  equity  income  fromour  joint  venture  investments,  gains  and  losses  on  sales  of  other  assets,
market-related adjustments and income associated with certain tax-advantaged
investments.
Software and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 10: Investment
Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 26% and 11% in the three and
nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in
2020,  respectively,  and  reflects  approximately  $104  million  and  $327  million
from  CRD  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,
respectively, compared to approximately $86 million and $303 million from CRD
in  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively.  Revenue  related  to  the  front  office
solutions  provided  by  CRD  is  primarily  driven  by  the  sale  of  term  software
licenses and software as service arrangements, including professional services
such  as  consulting  and  implementation  services,  software  support  and
maintenance.  Approximately  50%-70%  of  revenue  associated  with  a  sale  of
software to be installed on-premises is recognized at a point in time when the
customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with
the  percentage  varying  based  on  the  length  of  the  contract  and  other
contractual  terms.  The  remainder  of  revenue  for  on-premise  installations  is
recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services
are  provided.  Upon  renewal  of  an  on-premises  software  contract,  the  same
pattern  of  revenue  recognition  is  followed  with  50%-70%  recognized  upon
renewal and the balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for
a Software as a Service (SaaS) related arrangement, where the customer does
not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of the contract
as services are provided. Upon
renewal  of  a  SaaS  arrangement,  revenue  continues  to  be  recognized  asservices are provided under the new contract. As a result of these differences inhow portions of CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary morethan  other  business  units  quarter  to  quarter.  CRD  contributed  approximately$106  million  and  $336  million  in  total  revenue  in  the  three  and  nine  monthsended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  approximately$89 million and $314 million in the same  periods  in 2020, respectively,  whichincluded  in  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021approximately  $104  million  and  $327  million  in  software  and  processing  fees,respectively,  and  $3  million  and  $9  million  in  brokerage  and  other  tradingservices, respectively, within foreign exchange trading services.Amortization  of  tax  advantage  investments  negatively  impacted  softwareand processing fees by approximately $23 million and $79 million in the threeand  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to$24 million and $67 million in the same periods in 2020, respectively.In  addition,  FX  and  market-related  adjustments,  which  also  includescertain  fair  value  adjustments,  impacted  software  and  processing  fees  byapproximately $14 million and $16 million in the three and nine months endedSeptember 30, 2021, respectively, compared to ($2) million and $3 million in thesame periods in 2020, respectively.
Expenses
Total  expenses  for  Investment  Servicing  increased  1%  in  both  the  threeand nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in2020, primarily reflecting the impact of notable items and unfavorable currencytranslation.  Currency  translation  increased  expenses  for  Investment  Servicingby 1% in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 relative tothe same periods in 2020. Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenseand payroll taxes were $141 million in the nine months ended September 30,2021  compared  to  $125  million  in  the  same  period  in  2020.  Total  expensescontributed  by  CRD  were  approximately  $74  million  and  $211  million  in  thethree and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to$62  million  and  $181  million  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively.Additional  information  about  expenses  is  provided  under  "Expenses"  in"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussionand Analysis.

Investment Management total revenue increased 5% and 10% in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in2020.
Management Fees
Management  fees  increased  10%  in  both  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  higheraverage equity market levels and net inflows from ETFs, partially offset by idiosyncratic actions by an institutional client, as previously reported, and higher money marketfee waivers. As of September 30, 2021, and assuming short-term spot interest rates and the amount of money market fund assets remain constant, we estimate that theimpact  of  gross  money  market  fee  waivers  on  our  management  fees  would  be  approximately  $20  million  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021.  Currency  translation  increasedmanagement fees by 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExpenses
Total  expenses  for  Investment  Management  decreased  5%  in  the  three
months  ended  September  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,
primarily  due  to  expense  savings  initiatives,  partially  offset  by  higher
investments  and  unfavorable  currency  translation.  Total  expenses  for
Investment Management decreased 1% in the nine months ended September
30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  expense
savings  initiatives,  partially  offset  by  higher  seasonal  expenses  and  currency
translation.  Seasonal  deferred  incentive  compensation  expense  and  payroll
taxes  were  $35  million  in  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2021,
compared  to  $26  million  in  the  same  period  in  2020.  Currency  translation
increased expenses for Investment Management by 1% in both the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2021, relative to the same periods in 2020.
Additional  information  about  expenses  is  provided  under  "Expenses"  in
"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion
and Analysis.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven
by  the  liabilities  generated  by  our  Investment  Servicing  and  Investment
Management lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives
determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients
execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize
deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities.
These liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account
deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing
demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as shortterm investment alternatives for our clients.
Deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer
than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits
and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are
not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational

We consider a well-diversified, high-creditquality  investment  securities  portfolio  to  be  an  important  element  in  themanagement of our consolidated statement of condition.Average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 3.1 years and3.0 years as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Theincrease in securities duration is driven by higher interest rates leading to slowerMBS paydowns and the run-off of MMLF securities, partially offset by portfolioactivity, including purchases, run-off and sales.
Approximately 92% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated “AAA”or “AA” as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.TABLE 21: INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY EXTERNAL CREDIT RATING (EXCLUDINGSECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER THE MMLF PROGRAM)September 30, 2021December 31, 2020AAA 79%78 %AA 1314 A 44 BBB 44 100%100 %Includes U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities that are split-rated, “AAA” by Moody’s Investors Service and“AA+” by Standard & Poor’s and also includes Agency MBS securities which are not explicitly rated but which havean explicit or assumed guarantee from the U.S. government.

 As of September 30, 2021, other non-U.S. investments include $6.8 billion supranational bonds in AFS securities
and $1.4 billion supranational bonds in HTM securities.
Approximately 80% of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt
securities  was  rated  “AAA”  or  “AA”  as  of  both  September  30,  2021  and
December 31, 2020. The majority of these securities comprised senior positions
within the security structures; these positions have a level of protection provided
through  subordination  and  other  forms  of  credit  protection.  As  of  both
September  30,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,  approximately  26%  of  the
aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate.
As of September 30, 2021, our non-U.S. debt securities had an average
market-to-book ratio of 100.6%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of
$190  million,  composed  of  gross  unrealized  gains  of  $258  million  and  gross
unrealized losses of $68 million. These unrealized amounts included: • a  pre-tax  net  unrealized  gain  of  $130  million,  composed  of  gross
unrealized  gains  of  $193  million  and  gross  unrealized  losses  of  $63
million, associated with non-U.S. AFS debt securities; and
• a  pre-tax  net  unrealized  gain  of  $60  million,  composed  of  gross
unrealized gains of $65
million and gross unrealized losses of $5 million, associated with nonU.S. HTM debt securities.
As of September 30, 2021, the underlying collateral for non-U.S. MBS andABS  primarily  included  Australian,  U.K.,  Netherlands,  Spanish  and  Italianmortgages. The securities listed under “Canada” were composed of Canadiangovernment  securities  and  provincial  bonds,  corporate  debt  and  non-U.S.agency  securities.

$8,380 million private equity capital call finance loans and $821 million loans to business development companies
as of December 31, 2020.

as  of  September  30,  2021  and  $1,911  million  securities  finance  loans,  $754  million  loans  to  municipalities  and
$54 million other loans as of December 31, 2020.
 As of September 30, 2021, excluding overdrafts, floating rate loans totaled $26,529 million and fixed rate loans
totaled $2,453 million.
In the second quarter of 2021, in addition to our CLOs in the investment
portfolio, we began purchasing CLOs in loan form. The increase in foreign loans
as  of  September  30,  2021  compared  to  December  31,  2020  was  primarily
driven by the purchase of $2,412 million collateralized loan obligations in loan
form in 2021.
As  of  September  30,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,  our  leveraged
loans totaled approximately $4.72 billion and $4.17 billion, respectively. We sold
$84 million of leveraged loans in the third quarter of 2021, of which $46 million
remained unsettled and was held for sale as of September 30, 2021.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments  as of September 30,
2021 and December 31, 2020 of $279 million and $149 million, respectively, to
participate  in  syndications  of  leveraged  loans.  Additional  information  about
these
unfunded  commitments  is  provided  in  Note  9  to  the  consolidated  financialstatements in this Form 10-Q.
These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under ourinternal  risk-rating  framework  (refer  to  Note  4  to  the  consolidated  financialstatements  in  this  Form  10-Q),  are  externally  rated  “BBB,”  “BB”  or  “B,”  withapproximately 88% and 85% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of September 30,2021  and  December  31,  2020,  respectively.  Our  investment  strategy  involvesgenerally  limiting  our  investment  to  larger,  more  liquid  credits  underwritten  bymajor global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process toeach  potential  investment  and  diversifying  our  exposure  by  counterparty  andindustry  segment.  However,  these  loans  have  significant  exposure  to  creditlosses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.
Additional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlyingclasses,  is  provided  in  Note  4  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  thisForm 10-Q.
No  loans  were  modified  in  troubled  debt  restructurings  as  of  bothSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSconditions. As our view on current and future economic scenarios change, our
allowance for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a
change to the provisions for credit losses, reflecting credit migration within our
loan  portfolio,  as  well  as  changes  in  management's  economic  outlook  as  of
year-end. The remaining $49 million and $47 million as of September 30, 2021
and  2020,  respectively,  was  related  to  other  loans,  commercial  real  estate
loans,  off-balance  sheet  commitments  and  other  financial  assets  held  at
amortized cost, including investment securities held-to-maturity.
An  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  recognized  on  HTM  securities  upon
acquisition  of  the  security,  and  on  AFS  securities  when  the  fair  value  and
expected  future  cash  flows  of  the  investment  securities  are  less  than  their
amortized cost basis. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of
economic  and  security-specific  factors.  Such  factors  are  based  on  estimates,
derived  by  management,  which  contemplate  current  market  conditions  and
security-specific  performance.  To  the  extent  that  market  conditions  are  worse
than management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, the
credit-related component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would
be recorded in the provision for credit losses. Additional information with respect
to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized
losses related to investment securities, is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border Outstandings
Cross-border  outstandings  are  amounts  payable  to  us  by  non-U.S.
counterparties  which  are  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars  or  other  non-local
currency, as well as non-U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency
liabilities.  Our  cross-border  outstandings  consist  primarily  of  deposits  with
banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; investment
securities;  amounts  related  to  FX  and  interest  rate  contracts;  and  securities
finance.  In addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that,
as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be
unable  to  meet  their  contractual  repayment  obligations  of  principal  and/or
interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, FX needed
by borrowers to repay their obligations.
As market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit
rating  agencies  may  downgrade  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  and
sovereign  issuers  which  have  been,  and  may  in  the  future  be,  significant
counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which
we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and
may  do so  again in  the  future.  As  a result,  we  may  be  exposed  to  increasedcounterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.The  cross-border  outstandings  presented  in  Table  27:  Cross-borderoutstandings, represented approximately 24% and 30% of our consolidated totalassets as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.TABLE 27: CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS(In millions)

Risk Management
In the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to avariety  of  risks,  some  inherent  in  the  financial  services  industry,  others  morespecific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses onmaterial risks, which include the following: • credit and counterparty risk; • liquidity risk, funding and management; • operational risk; • information technology risk; • market risk associated with our trading activities;• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer toas asset-and-

• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many  of these  risks,  as  well as certain  of  the factors  underlying  each  of
these  risks  that  could  affect  our  businesses  and  our  consolidated  financial
statements, are discussed in detail on pages 24 to 52 included under Item 1A,
Risk Factors, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
For  additional  information  about  our  risk  management,  including  our  risk

to  89  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2020
Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower
or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling
to  repay  borrowings  or  settle  a  transaction  in  accordance  with  underlying
contractual terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending
activities,  such  as  overdrafts,  loans  and  contingent  commitments,  in  our
investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in
our direct and indirect trading activities, such as securities purchased under a
resale agreement, principal securities lending and FX and indemnified agency
securities  lending.  We  also  assume  credit  risk  in  our  day-to-day  treasury  and
securities  and  other  settlement  operations,  in  the  form  of  deposit  placements
and  other  cash  balances,  with  central  banks  or  private  sector  institutions  and
fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our financial assets
held  at  amortized  cost.  We  also  maintain  an  allowance  for  unfunded
commitments  and  letters  of  credit  to  support  our  off-balance  sheet  credit
exposure.  The  two  components  together  represent  the  allowance  for  credit
losses.  Review  and  evaluation  of  the  adequacy  of  the  allowance  for  credit
losses  is  ongoing  throughout  the  year,  but  occurs  at  least  quarterly,  and  is
based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio
and  the  estimated  effects  of  our  forecasts  on  our  counterparties.  We  utilize
multiple  economic  scenarios,  consisting  of  a  baseline,  upside  and  downside
scenarios, to develop management's forecast of future expected losses.
The  economic  forecast  utilized  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021  reflectsimprovements  in  credit  quality  and  stable  economic  outlook.  Allowanceestimates  remain  subject  to  continued  model  and  economic  uncertainty  andmanagement  may  use  qualitative  adjustments.  If  future  data  and  forecastsdeviate  relative  to  the  forecasts  utilized  to  determine  our  allowance  for  creditlosses as of September 30, 2021, or if credit risk migration is higher or lowerthan  forecasted  for  reasons  independent  of  the  economic  forecast,  ourallowance for credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided inNotes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.For  additional  information  about  our  credit  risk  management  framework,including  our  core  policies  and  principles,  structure  and  organization,  creditratings, risk parameter estimates,  credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting,monitoring  and  controls,  refer  to  pages  89  to  94  included  under  Item  7,Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  ofOperations, Credit Risk Management, in our 2020 Form 10-K.Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk-based on ouractivities,  size  and other  appropriate  risk-related  factors.  In  managing  liquidityrisk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicatorsand  perform  routine  stress  testing  to  identify  potential  liquidity  needs.  Thisprocess  involves  the  evaluation  of  a  combination  of  internal  and  externalscenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifyingpotential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, aswell  as  the  potential  impairment  of  our  ability  to  access  the  global  capitalmarkets.
We manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. We also manageliquidity  on  a  stand-alone  basis  at  our  Parent  Company,  as  well  as  at  certainbranches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally hasaccess  to  markets  and  funding  sources  limited  to  banks,  such  as  the  federalfunds market and the Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Companyis managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower marketaccess. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct accessto, primarily through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company, and thesupport  agreement,  as  discussed  in  the  "Uses  of  Liquidity"  section  of  thisManagement's Discussion and Analysis, enough cash to meet its current debtmaturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-yearperiod.  Reference  our  SPOE  Strategy  as  discussed  in  the  "Uses  of  Liquidity"section of this Management'sState Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the
liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company.
As of September 30, 2021, our Parent Company and State Street Bank had no
senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next
twelve months.
As  a  systemically  important  financial  institution,  our  liquidity  risk
management  activities  are  subject  to  heightened  and  evolving  regulatory
requirements,  including  interpretations  of  those  requirements,  under  specific
U.S.  and  international  regulations  and  also  resulting  from  published  and
unpublished  guidance,  supervisory  activities,  such  as  stress  tests,  resolution
planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these
requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our
investment  portfolio,  reduced  NII  or  NIM,  a  reduction  in  the  level  of  certain
business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products
and services. If we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our
regulators,  we  could  receive  negative  regulatory  stress  test  results,  incur  a
resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or
otherwise  receive  an  adverse  regulatory  finding.  Our  efforts  to  satisfy,  or  our
failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For  additional  information  on  our  liquidity  risk  management,  as  well  as
liquidity metrics, refer to pages 94 to 99 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,
Liquidity Risk Management, in our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information
on our liquidity  ratios,  including  LCR and the  net  stable  funding  ratio,  refer  to
page 14 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion
in the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under
the  LCR  rule  approved  by  U.S.  banking  regulators.  The  LCR  is  intended  to
promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations,
like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising frommarket stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and
management of liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against
its  net  cash  outflows.  HQLA  primarily  consists  of  unencumbered  cash  and
certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule.
The LCR was fully
implemented  beginning  on  January  1,  2017.  We  report  LCR  to  the  FederalReserve daily. For the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and December 31,2020,  daily  average  LCR  for  the  Parent  Company  was  105%  and  108%,respectively,  with  the  lower  daily  average  LCR  for  the  quarter  endedSeptember 30, 2021 driven primarily by higher deposits. The impact of higherdeposits on the Parent Company's LCR is offset by a cap on the HQLA fromState Street Bank and Trust that can be recognized at the Parent Company asdefined  in  the  U.S.  LCR  Final  Rule  as  it  prohibits  the  upstreaming  of  liquidityunder stress. The average HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR finalrule definition was $151.48 billion and $143.61 billion, post-prescribed haircuts,for  the  quarters  ended  September  30,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,respectively.  The  increase  in  average  HQLA  for  the  quarter  endedSeptember 30, 2021, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2020, wasprimarily  due  to  a  higher  level  of  client  deposits.  For  the  quarter  endedSeptember 30, 2021, LCR for State Street Bank and Trust was approximately127%. State Street Bank and Trust's LCR is higher than the Parent Company'sLCR,  primarily  due  to  application  of  the  transferability  restriction  in  the  LCRFinal Rule to the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR. This restriction limitsthe HQLA used in the calculation of the Parent Company's LCR to the amountof net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary (State Street Bank andTrust). This transferability restriction does not apply in the calculation of StateStreet Bank and Trust's LCR, and therefore State Street Bank and Trust's LCRreflects the benefit of all of its HQLA holdings.
We  maintained  average  cash  balances  in  excess  of  regulatoryrequirements  governing  deposits  with  the  Federal  Reserve  of  approximately$76.83  billion  at  the  Federal  Reserve,  the  ECB  and  other  non-U.S.  centralbanks  for  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2021,  and  $75.68  billion  for  thequarter ended December 31, 2020. The higher levels of average cash balanceswith central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.Liquid  securities  carried  in  our  asset  liquidity  include  securities  pledgedwithout  corresponding  advances  from  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Boston(FRBB),  the  FHLB,  and  other  non-U.S.  central  banks.  State  Street  Bank  is  amember  of  the  FHLB.  This  membership  allows  for  advances  of  liquidity  invarying  terms  against  high-quality  collateral,  which  helps  facilitate  asset-andliability management. As of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,we had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB.
Access  to  primary,  intra-day  and  contingent  liquidity  provided  by  theseutilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject toState Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSunderlying conditions. As of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
we  had  no  outstanding  primary  credit  borrowings  from  the  FRBB  discount
window or any other central bank facility.
In  addition  to  the  securities  included  in  our  asset  liquidity,  we  have
significant  amounts  of  other  unencumbered  investment  securities.  These
securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as
those included in our asset liquidity.
The  average  fair  value  of  total  unencumbered  securities  was  $100.03
billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, compared to $89.12 billion for
the quarter ended December 31, 2020.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals
of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances
to clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan
portfolios;  or  other  permitted  purposes.  Such  circumstances  would  generally
arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring
use  of  our  liquidity  involves  our  deployment  of  HQLA  from  our  investment
portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities
under our enhanced custody program.
We  had  unfunded  commitments  to  extend  credit  with  gross  contractual
amounts totaling $34.47 billion and $34.21 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling  $3.33  billion  and  $3.33  billion  as  of  September  30,  2021  and
December 31, 2020, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any
collateral.  As  of  September  30,  2021,  approximately  73%  of  our  unfunded
commitments  to  extend  credit  and  28%  of  our  standby  letters  of  credit  expire
within  one  year.  Since  many  of  our  commitments  are  expected  to  expire  or
renew  without  being  drawn  upon,  the  gross  contractual  amounts  do  not
necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
State  Street,  like  other  bank  holding  companies  considered  systemically
important,  periodically  submits  a  plan  for  rapid  and  orderly  resolution  in  the
event  of  material  financial  distress  or  failure,  commonly  referred  to  as  a
resolution  plan  or  a  living  will,  to  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the  FDIC  under
Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek, in
the  event  of  our  insolvency,  to  maintain  State  Street  Bank’s  role  as  a  key
infrastructure  provider within the financial system,  while minimizing risk to  the
financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. We
have and will continue to focus management
attention  and  resources  to  meet  regulatory  expectations  with  respect  toresolution planning.
The  Federal  Reserve  and  FDIC  jointly  issued  a  final  rule  that  waspublished in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019. This final rule revisedthe  implementation  requirements  under  the  Dodd  Frank  Act's  resolutionplanning provisions by means of establishing a biennial filing cycle for the U.S.G-SIBs,  including  State  Street.  This  cycle  alternates  between  a  targetedresolution plan, followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agenciespublished on June 29, 2020 the scope for the 2021 targeted resolution plan, toinclude  the  core  elements  of  resolution  planning  and  some  specific  firm  levelinformation, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We submitted our2021 targeted resolution plan to the Agencies by July 1, 2021.In the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolutionstrategy  is  the  SPOE  Strategy.  For  additional  information  about  the  SPOEStrategy, refer to pages 18 to 20 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2020Form  10-K.  The  SPOE  Strategy  provides  that  prior  to  the  bankruptcy  of  theParent  Company  and  pursuant  to  a  support  agreement  among  the  ParentCompany, SSIF, our Beneficiary Entities (as defined below) and certain other ofour  entities,  SSIF  is  obligated,  up  to  its  available  resources,  to  recapitalizeand/or  provide  liquidity  to  State  Street  Bank  and  our  other  entities  benefitingfrom  such  capital  and/or  liquidity  (collectively  with  State  Street  Bank,“Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary Entitiesfrom  themselves  entering  into  resolution  proceedings.  Following  therecapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the ParentCompany would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. BankruptcyCode. The Beneficiary Entities and our subsidiaries would be transferred  to anewly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefitof the Parent Company’s claimants.
Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIFby  contributing  certain  of  its  assets  (primarily  its  liquid  assets,  cash  deposits,debt investments, investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments)  to SSIF contemporaneous with entering into thesupport  agreement  and  will  continue  to  contribute  such  assets,  to  the  extentavailable, on an on-going basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIFhas agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support tothe Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with theParent Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement,the Parent Company is only permitted to retain certain amounts of cash neededto meet its
State Street Corporation | 34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSupcoming  obligations  and  to  fund  expenses  during  a  potential  bankruptcy
proceeding.  SSIF  has  provided  the  Parent  Company  with  a  committed  credit
line and issued  (and may  issue)  one or  more  promissory  notes  to the  Parent
Company  (the  Parent  Company  Funding  Notes)  that  together  are  intended  to
allow us to continue to meet our obligations throughout the period prior to the
occurrence  of  a  "Recapitalization  Event"  (as  defined  below).  The  support
agreement does not contemplate that SSIF is obligated to maintain any specific
level of resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the
SPOE Strategy.
In  the  event  a Recapitalization  Event  occurs,  the  obligations  outstanding
under the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or
be  exchanged  for  capital  contributed  to  SSIF.  The  obligations  of  the  Parent
Company  and  SSIF  under  the  support  agreement  are  secured  through  a
security  agreement  that  grants  a lien on the assets  that  the Parent  Company
and SSIF would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to
the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent
Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with its policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis,  the  capital  and  liquidity  needs  of  State  Street  Bank  and  the  other
Beneficiary  Entities.  To  support  this  process,  we  have  established  a  trigger
framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions
that  would  need  to  be  made  if  certain  events  tied  to  our  financial  condition
occur.  In the event that we experience material  financial distress,  the support
agreement  requires  us  to  model  and  calculate  certain  capital  and  liquidity
triggers  on  a  regular  basis  to  determine  whether  or  not  the  Parent  Company
should  commence  preparations  for  a  bankruptcy  filing  and  whether  or  not  a
Recapitalization Event has occurred.
Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Recapitalization  Event:  (1)  SSIF  would  not  be
authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent
Company  would  be  required  to  contribute  to  SSIF  any  remaining  assets  it  is
required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement; (3) SSIF would be
required  to  provide  capital  and  liquidity  support  to  the  Beneficiary  Entities  to
support such entities’ continued operation; and (4) the Parent Company would
be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the support agreement, should
rely, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective or
determining  whether  to  enter  into  a  contractual  relationship  with  any  of  our
entities, on any of our affiliates being or remaining a Beneficiary Entity or
receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement.A “Recapitalization Event” is defined under the support agreement as theearlier  occurrence  of  one  or  more  capital  and  liquidity  thresholds  beingbreached or the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors forthe Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. These thresholdsare set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital andliquidity  to  enable  an  orderly  resolution  without  extraordinary  governmentsupport. The SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreementmay result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencementof  bankruptcy  proceedings  by  the  Parent  Company  at  an  earlier  stage  offinancial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place.An  expected  effect  of  the  SPOE  Strategy  and  applicable  TLAC  regulatoryrequirements  is  that  losses  will  be  imposed  on  the  Parent  Companyshareholders  and  the  holders  of  long-term  debt  and  other  forms  of  TLACsecurities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company,as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of its losses areimposed  on  the  holders  of  the  debt  securities  of  the  Parent  Company'soperating  subsidiaries  or  any  of  their  depositors  or  creditors,  or  before  U.S.taxpayers are put at risk.
There can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our2021  resolution  plan  or  the  support  agreement,  will  not  downgrade,  place  onnegative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generally oron specific debt securities. Any such downgrade, placement on negative watchor  change  in  outlook  could  adversely  affect  our  cost  of  borrowing,  limit  ouraccess  to  the  capital  markets  or  result  in  restrictive  covenants  in  future  debtagreements and could also adversely impact the trading prices, or the liquidity,of our outstanding debt securities.
State  Street  Bank  is  also  required  to  submit,  periodically  in  accordancewith applicable regulations and FDIC guidance, a plan for resolution in the eventof its failure, referred to as an Insured Depository Institution (IDI) plan. On April22,  2019,  the  Federal  Register  published  the  FDIC’s  advance  notice  ofproposed rulemaking in which it invited comment on potential revisions to its IDIplan requirements.  In addition to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking,on April 16, 2019, the FDIC Board voted to delay the next round of submissionsunder the IDI Rule until the rulemaking process has been completed. On June25,  2021, the  FDIC  issued  a policy statement  adjusting  the timing  of IDI  plansubmissions to a triennial filing for State Street and the other U.S. G-SIBs.State Street Corporation | 35

Deposits
We  provide  products  and  services  including  custody,  accounting,
administration,  daily  pricing,  FX  services,  cash  management,  financial  asset
management,  securities  finance  and  investment  advisory  services.  As  a
provider  of  these  products  and  services,  we  generate  client  deposits,  which
have  generally  provided  a  stable,  low-cost  source  of  funds.  As  a  global
custodian,  clients  place  deposits  with  our  entities  in  various  currencies.  As  of
September 30, 2021, approximately 64% of our average total deposit balances
were  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars,  16%  in  EUR,  10%  in  the  British  pound
Sterling  (GBP)  and 10% in all other  currencies,  whereas  as of December  31,
2020,  approximately  65%  of  our  average  total  deposit  balances  were
denominated  in  U.S.  dollars,  approximately  15%  in  EUR,  10%  in  the  British
pound Sterling (GBP) and 10% in all other currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities
of  the  assets,  but  more  importantly,  they  provide  us  with  the  ability  to  raise
funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright
sales. In addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to
source  incremental  funding  from  wholesale  investors.  As  discussed  earlier
under “Asset Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for
advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term  secured  funding  also  comes  in  the  form  of  securities  lent  or
sold  under  agreements  to  repurchase.  These  transactions  are  short-term  in
nature,  generally  overnight  and  are  collateralized  by  high-quality  investment
securities.  These  balances  were  $0.64  billion  and  $3.41  billion  as  of
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
State  Street  Bank  currently  maintains  a  line  of  credit  with  a  financial
institution  of  CAD  $1.40  billion,  or  approximately  $1.10  billion,  as  of
September 30, 2021, to support its Canadian securities processing operations.
The  line  of  credit  has  no  stated  termination  date  and  is  cancelable  by  either
party with prior notice. As of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal  shelf  registration  statement  to  meet  current  commitments  and
business needs. The total amount remaining for
issuance under the registration statement is $4.25 billion as of September 30,2021.  In  addition,  State  Street  Bank  also  has  current  authorization  from  theBoard to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt.On March 3, 2021, we issued $850 million aggregate principal amount of2.200% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2031.
In  September  2021,  we  completed  a  public  offering  of  approximately21.7  million  shares  of  our  common  stock  to  provide  partial  funding  for  our$3.5  billion  proposed  purchase  of  the  BBH  Investor  Services  business.  Theoffering  price  was  $87.60  per  share  and  net  proceeds  totaled  approximately$1.9 billion.
Agency Credit RatingsOur  ability  to  maintain  consistent  access  to  liquidity  is  fostered  by  themaintenance  of  high  investment  grade  ratings  as  measured  by  the  majorindependent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high creditratings include: • diverse and stable core earnings; • relative market position; • strong risk management; • strong capital ratios; • diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and clientdeposits; • strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability tooffer products; • serving markets; and• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.A  downgrade  or  reduction  of  our  credit  ratings  could  have  a  materialadverse  effect  on  our  liquidity  by  restricting  our  ability  to  access  the  capitalmarkets, which could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could causethe  sudden  and  large-scale  withdrawal  of  unsecured  deposits  by  our  clients,which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit ortrigger  requirements  under  securities  purchase  commitments;  or  requireadditional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.A  majority  of  our  derivative  contracts  have  been  entered  into  underbilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral orterminate the transactions based on changes inState Street Corporation | 36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSour credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by determining
the  collateral  that  would  be  required  assuming  a  downgrade  by  all  rating
agencies.  The  additional  collateral  or  termination  payments  related  to  our  net
derivative liabilities under these arrangements  that could have been called by
counterparties  in  the  event  of  a  downgrade  in  our  credit  ratings  below  levels
specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q. Other funding sources, such as secured financing
transactions  and  other  margin  requirements,  for  which  there  are  no  explicit
triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational  risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed
internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
In  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  continue  to  have  business
continuity arrangements in place across our operating locations, and we, and a
significant percentage of our key service providers, are operating significantly or
entirely in a work from home environment. The current operating environment
increases  operational  risk  and  information  technology  risk,  including  cyberthreats. See also “Information Technology Risk Management” below.
For  additional  information  about  our  operational  risk  framework,  refer  to
pages  100  to  103  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  "Operational  Risk
Management", in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We define information technology risk as the risk associated with the use,
ownership,  operation,  involvement,  influence  and  adoption  of  information
technology.  Information  technology  risk  includes  risks  triggered  by  technology
non-compliance  with  regulatory  obligations,  information  security  and  privacy
incidents,  business  disruption,  technology  internal  control  and  process  gaps,
technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
For additional information about our information technology risk framework
and  associated  risks,  refer  to  pages  103  to  104  included  under  Item  7,

information  technology  systems  or  facilities  or  disruptions  to  our  continuous
operations, including
the systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business,such  as  resulting  from  cyber-attacks,  could  result  in  significant  costs,reputational damage and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities".Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss thatcould  result  from  broad  market  movements,  such  as  changes  in  the  generallevel  of  interest  rates,  credit  spreads,  foreign  exchange  rates  or  commodityprices. We are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our nontrading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities isprovided  below  under  “Trading  Activities.”  Information  about  the  market  riskassociated  with  our  non-trading  activities,  which  consists  primarily  of  interestrate risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”Trading ActivitiesIn the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level ofwhich is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidityneeds, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution againstthose factors.
For additional information about the market risk associated with our tradingactivities,  refer  to  pages  104  to  106  included  under  Item  7,  Management'sDiscussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,"Market Risk Management" in our 2020 Form 10-K.
As  part  of  our  trading  activities,  we  assume  positions  in  the  foreignexchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments andentering  into  derivative  instruments,  including  foreign  exchange  forwardcontracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps,interest  rate  forward  contracts  and  interest  rate  futures.  As  of  September  30,2021,  the  notional  amount  of  these  derivative  contracts  was  $2.40  trillion,  ofwhich $2.38 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spotcontracts.  We  seek  to  match  positions  closely  with  the  objective  of  mitigatingrelated currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valueddaily at current market rates.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaRWe use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, includingVaR,  which  is  an  estimate  of  potential  loss  for  a  given  period  within  a  statedstatistical  confidence  interval.  We  use  a  risk  measurement  methodology  tomeasure trading-related VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuringtrading-related  VaR,  and  we  maintain  regulatory  capital  for  market  riskassociated with our
State Street Corporation | 37
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONStrading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market
risk  requirements.  Our  regulatory  VaR-based  measure  is  calculated  based  on
historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period
calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding
period.
We  calculate  a  stressed  VaR-based  measure  using  the  same  model  we
use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a
range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress.
The  stressed  VaR  model  is  designed  to  identify  the  second-worst  outcome
occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This
stressed  VaR  meets  the  regulatory  requirement  as  the  rolling  ten-day  period
with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelvemonth  period  of  financial  stress.  For  each  portfolio,  the  stress  period  is
determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces
the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical data. This
historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period
surrounding  the  Eurozone  sovereign  debt  crisis  and  the  Standard  &  Poor's
downgrade  of  U.S.  Treasury  debt  in  August  2011.  As  the  historical  data  set
used  to  determine  the  stress  period  expands  over  time,  future  market  stress
events will be incorporated.
For  additional  information  about  our  VaR  measurement  tools  and
methodologies, refer to pages 107 to 110 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,

Stress Testing
We  have  a  corporate-wide  stress  testing  program  in  place  that
incorporates  an  array  of  techniques  to  measure  the  potential  loss  we  could
suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions.
We  also  monitor  concentrations  of  risk  such  as  concentration  by  branch,  risk
component,  and  currency  pairs.  We  conduct  stress  testing  on  a  daily  basis
based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in
order  to  estimate  the  potential  impact  to  our  current  portfolio  should  similar
market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing
as  part  of  the  Federal  Reserve's  CCAR  process.  Stress  testing  is  conducted,analyzed  and  reported  at  the  corporate,  trading  desk,  division  and  risk-factorlevel (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis byERM  and  reported  to  the  Credit  and  Market  Risk  Committee  (CMRC).  Limitbreaches  are  addressed  by  ERM  risk  managers  in  conjunction  with  thebusiness  units,  escalated  as  appropriate,  and  reviewed  by  the  CMRC  ifmaterial.  In  addition,  we  have  established  several  action  triggers  that  promptreview by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.Validation and Back-TestingWe  perform  frequent  back-testing  to  assess  the  accuracy  of  our  VaRbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testinginvolves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profitand-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-testour VaR model using “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such asfees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific tothe  price  movement  of  the  trading  assets  and  liabilities  themselves,  such  asfees,  commissions,  changes  to  reserves  and  gains  or  losses  from  intra-dayactivity.
We  experienced  no  back-testing  exceptions  in  the  quarters  endedSeptember  30,  2021,  June  30,  2021  and  September  30,  2020.  At  a  99%confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness oneexception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).The  following  tables  present  VaR  and  stressed  VaR  associated  with  ourtrading  activities  for  covered  positions  held  during  the  quarters  endedSeptember 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively, asmeasured  by  our  VaR  methodology.  Diversification  effect  in  the  tables  belowrepresents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for eachtrading  activity.  This  effect  arises  because  the  risks  present  in  our  tradingactivities are not perfectly correlated.

The increase in the average stressed VaR for thequarter ended September 30, 2021, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and the quarter ended September 30, 2020, is primarily attributed to higher interest raterisk positions.
The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk inour trading activities. Overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the periodused for the calculations. Both the ten-day VaR-based measures and the stressed VaR-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-dayperiods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review andapproval, and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.
The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk asof September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAsset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of theassets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NIIand the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from theinvestment  of client  deposits  generated  by our businesses.  We invest  these  client  deposits  in assets  that  conform  generally  to the characteristics  of our balance sheetliabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investmentportfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rateshocks. The baseline view of NII is updated on a regular basis. Relative to the year ago period, the September 30, 2021 baseline forecast is based on an increased balancesheet size. Compared to June 30, 2021, the baseline forecast assumes a modest reduction in balance sheet size over the subsequent twelve-month horizon. Table 32, KeyInterest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. OurSeptember 30, 2021 baseline forecast assumes no changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.

Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changeson our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our depositbalances are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline.
Beginning  with  the  December  31,  2020  reporting  period,  we  enhanced  our  NII  sensitivity  methodology  so  that  the  full  impact  of  rate  shocks  are  realized  for  allcurrencies even if the result is negative interest rates. Prior to the December 31, 2020 reporting period, our results in lower rate scenarios were impacted by an assumedfloor at zero for certain currencies including U.S. dollar. For consistency in this disclosure, the September 30, 2020 reporting period is restated in the table below usingenhanced modeling for negative rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs of September 30, 2021, NII and U.S. dollar NII is expected to benefit
from  both  parallel  increases  and  decreases  in  interest  rates.  Compared  to
September 30, 2020, our NII and U.S. dollar NII is more sensitive to parallel rate
increases, primarily due to higher levels of client deposits. Our projection of an
NII benefit to an upward rate shock of +100bps assumes deposit betas remain
low, consistent with the last rising rate cycle. Our projection also assumes that
deposit levels remain relatively consistent with third quarter 2021 averages. We
expect that our NII benefit in the +100bps scenarios would be lower if deposits
levels decline in a rising rate environment.
Compared  to September  30, 2020, our NII  and U.S.  dollar NII  benefit  to
lower  rates  has  increased  primarily  due  to  growth  in  fixed  and  contractually
floored securities and loans. Our projection of an NII benefit from a downward
rate shock of -100 bps assumes negative interest rates are charged on client
deposits and contractual floors are reached on our securities and loans. NII is
also  exposed  to  smaller  shocks  to  short-end  U.S.  interest  rates.  If  short-end
U.S.  market  interest  rates  increase  or  (decrease)  by  5  bps,  we  estimate  the
annualized  impact  to  be  approximately  $20  million  in  higher  (or  lower)  NII
primarily due to the impact on our sponsored repo activity.
NII is still positioned to benefit from changes in non-U.S. interest rates with
the  majority  of  our  sensitivity  derived  from  the  short-end  of  the  curve  given
deposit  pricing  expectations.  Compared  to September  30,  2020,  our  non-U.S.
benefit  from  higher  rates  increased  due  to  higher  non-U.S.  deposit  balances.
Our  benefit  from  lower  rates  decreased  due  to  lower  levels  of  non-U.S.
securities.
EVE sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the
fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a
long-term  horizon.  In the following table,  we report  our EVE sensitivity  to 200
bps  instantaneous  rate  shocks,  relative  to  spot  interest  rates.  Management
compares the change in EVE sensitivity against our aggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2
risk-based  capital,  calculated  in  conformity  with  current  applicable  regulatory
requirements.  EVE  sensitivity  is  dependent  on  the  timing  of  interest  and
principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet
and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.

As  of  September  30,  2021,  EVE  sensitivity  remains  exposed  to  upward
shifts in interest rates. Compared to September 30, 2020, our sensitivity in both
the up and down 200 shock scenarios
decreased  due  to  higher  client  deposits,  partially  offset  by  growth  in  oursecurities portfolio and interest rate hedging activity.
Both NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitored as marketconditions  change.

The  use  of  models  is  widespread  throughout  the  financial  servicesindustry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated modelsto  support  numerous  aspects  of  their  financial  decision  making.  The  modelscontemporaneously  represent  both  a  significant  advancement  in  financialmanagement and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, modelresults  influence  business  decisions,  and  model  failure  could  have  a  harmfuleffect  on our financial performance.  As a result,  the Model Risk ManagementFramework seeks to mitigate our model risk.
For  additional  information  about  our  model  risk  management  framework,including  our  governance  and  model  validation,  refer  to  pages  112  to  113included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition  and  Results  of  Operations,  "Model  Risk  Management",  in  our  2020Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earningsor capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation ofstrategic  initiatives,  or  lack  of  responsiveness  to  industry-wide  changes.Strategic  risks  are  influenced  by  changes  in  the  competitive  environment;decline  in  market  performance  or  changes  in  our  business  activities;  and  thepotential  secondary  impacts  of  reputational  risks,  not  already  captured  asmarket, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporatestrategic  risk  into  our  assessment  of  our  business  plans  and  risk  and  capitalmanagement processes.
On  March  5,  2021,  the  Intercontinental  Exchange  BenchmarkAdministration  announced,  in  conjunction  with  the  United  Kingdom  FinancialConduct  Authority  (FCA),  that  it  would  cease  the  publication  of  GBP,  EUR,Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen LIBOR settings for all tenors, as well as oneweek and two months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021 andwould cease the publication of overnight and twelve months U.S. dollar LIBORsettings on June 30, 2023.
On  April  6,  2021,  the  state  of  New  York  adopted  Alternative  ReferenceRate Committee sponsoredState Street Corporation | 41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSlegislation  that  would,  among  other  things,  provide  for  the  replacement  of
LIBOR references in hard to modify legacy financial contracts governed by New
York  law  with  a  benchmark  rate  based  on  SOFR.  Other  states  may  adopt
similar legislation.
U.S. bank regulators have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking
organizations  to  cease  using  U.S.  dollar  LIBOR  as  a  reference  rate  in  new
contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. We
are continuing our efforts to work to facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR,
and other interbank offered rates, to alternative reference rates for us and our
clients in a manner consistent with supervisory expectations.
For additional information about our strategic risk management framework
and associated risks, refer to page 113 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,
"Strategic  Risk  Management",  in  our  2020  Form  10-K,  and  page  46  included

away  from  broad  use  of  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR)  as  an
interest rate benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may expose us

Capital
Managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected
levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with
all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the
financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess
capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as
our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated
by  banking  regulators,  and  requires  us  to  maintain  an  additional  capital
surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule.
Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR
buffer in addition to the required minimum of 3% under the Basel III final rule. If
we  fail  to  exceed  any  regulatory  buffer  or  surcharge,  we  will  be  subject  to
increased  restrictions  (depending  upon  the  extent  of  the  shortfall)  regarding
capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank
or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be
subject to the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.
For  additional  information  about  our  capital,  refer  to  pages  113  to  121
included under Item 7,
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  ofOperations, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital
We  and  State  Street  Bank,  as  advanced  approaches  bankingorganizations,  are  subject  to  the  U.S.  Basel  III  framework.  Provisions  of  theBasel III final rule became effective on January 1, 2014 with full implementationrequired on January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the final market risk capitalrule issued by U.S. banking regulators effective as of January 2013.The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capitaladequacy:  the  “standardized  approach"  and  the  “advanced  approaches",applicable  to  advanced  approaches  banking  organizations,  like  us.  Thestandardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk RWA,including specified risk weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures.The  advanced  approaches  consist  of  the  Advanced  Internal  Ratings-BasedApproach  used  for  the  calculation  of  RWA  related  to  credit  risk,  and  theAdvanced Measurement  Approach used for the calculation of RWA related tooperational risk.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010 and the Stress CapitalBuffer  (SCB)  rule  enacted  in  2020,  we  and  State  Street  Bank,  as  advancedapproaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referredto  as  the  Collins  Amendment,  in  the  assessment  of  our  regulatory  capitaladequacy, including the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the SCB, for theadvanced  approaches  and  standardized  approach,  respectively,  and  acountercyclical capital buffer. In addition, we are subject to a G-SIB surcharge.Our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lowerof  each  ratio  calculated  under  the  advanced  approaches  and  standardizedapproach.
The  SCB  replaced,  under  the  standardized  approach,  the  capitalconservation  buffer  with  a  buffer  calculated  as  the  difference  between  theinstitution’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severelyadverse  scenario  plus  planned  common  stock  dividend  payments  (as  apercentage  of  RWA)  from  the  fourth  through  seventh  quarter  of  the  CCARplanning  horizon.  The  SCB  requirement,  which  became  effective  October  1,2020, can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatorybuffer  or  surcharge  will  limit  a  banking  organization’s  ability  to  make  capitaldistributions  and  discretionary  bonus  payments  to  executive  officers.  Thecountercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by U.S. banking regulators.State Street Corporation | 42
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2021, include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and standardized approach,respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of 0.0%. This results in minimum risk-based ratios of 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1 capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Based on a calculation date of December 31, 2019, our current G-SIB surcharge, through December 31, 2022, is 1.0%. Based on a calculation date of December 31,2020, our G-SIB surcharge beginning January 1, 2023 could have been 1.5%. However, in May 2021, the Federal Reserve granted our request for relief relating to theeffects of the MMLF program on the calculation of our G-SIB surcharge. As a result of this relief, our G-SIB surcharge for 2023 will be 1.0%.
To  maintain  the  status  of  the  Parent  Company  as  a  financial  holding  company,  we  and  our  insured  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are  required,  among  otherrequirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.
The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positionsdefined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public disclosure composed ofqualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative andquantitative information required by the rule is provided under "Market Risk Management" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. We are subjectto the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment ofour capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.

 Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results ofoperations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, ifapplicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorizationamong the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
 Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%.

 Not applicable As of September 30, 2021, total advanced approaches RWA increased $5.17 billion compared to December 31, 2020, mainly due to an increase in credit risk andoperational risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by a net increase in all other and loans RWA.
As of September 30, 2021, total standardized approach RWA increased $0.15 billion compared to December 31, 2020, mainly due to higher market risk RWA, partiallyoffset by lower credit risk RWA. The decrease in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by a decrease in repo-style transactions RWA, partially offset by an increase in FXtrading and loans RWA.
The regulatory capital ratios as of September 30, 2021, presented in Table 35: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculatedunder  the  advanced  approaches  and  standardized  approach  in  conformity  with  the  Basel  III  final  rule.  The  advanced  approaches-based  ratios  reflect  calculations  anddeterminations with respect to our capital and related matters as of September 30, 2021, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historicalcorrelations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in aquarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q  or  an  annual  report  on  Form  10-K.  Significant  components  of  these  advanced  systems  involve  the  exercise  of  judgment  by  us  and  ourregulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for whichthey are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces andevents experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subjectto continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a relatedloss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capitalratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under theadvanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approachfor a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due  to  the  influence  of  changes  in  these  advanced  systems,  whether  resulting  from  changes  in  data  inputs,  regulation  or  regulatory  supervision  or  interpretation,specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with theBasel III final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period.The full effects of the Basel III final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.(1)

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a supplementary
leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted
quarterly  average  on-balance  sheet  assets.  The  Tier  1  leverage  ratio  differs
from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a
quarterly  average  of  on-balance  sheet  assets,  while  the  SLR  additionally
includes  off-balance  sheet  exposures.  We  must  maintain  a  minimum  Tier  1
leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we
must maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions
to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we
do not maintain this buffer,  limitations on these distributions  and discretionary
bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the
shortfall.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
In  2016,  the  Federal  Reserve  released  its  final  rule  on  TLAC,  LTD  andclean  holding  company  requirements  for  U.S.  domiciled  G-SIBs,  such  as  us,that  is  intended  to  improve  the  resiliency  and  resolvability  of  certain  U.S.banking  organizations  through  enhanced  prudential  standards.  Among  otherthings, the TLAC final rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements forexternal  TLAC  and  external  LTD  effective  January  1,  2019.  Specifically,  wemust hold:
Amount equal to:
Combined eligible tier 1

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSthis  point  in  time,  it  is  unclear  whether  this  proposal  will  be  implemented  as
proposed.
In  November  2019,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  federal  banking
agencies  issued  a  final  rule  to  implement  the  Standardized  Approach  for
Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) as a replacement of the Current Exposure
Method for calculating exposure-at-default of derivatives exposures. Mandatory
compliance with the final rule is required by January 1, 2022. Due to the nature
of  our  trading  activities,  the  impact  of  the  final  rule  may  have  a  greater
proportional impact on our RWA than on some of our G-SIB peers.
On March 4, 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued the SCB final
rule  that  replaces,  under  the  standardized  approach,  the  capital  conservation
buffer (2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between an institution’s
starting  and  lowest  projected  CET1  ratio  under  the  CCAR  severely  adverse
scenario  plus  planned  common  stock  dividend  payments  (as  a  percentage  of
RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon.
The SCB requirement, which became effective October 1, 2020, can be no less
than 2.5% of RWA.
The Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an
interim  final  rule  effective  in  March  2020  and  later  finalized  on  a  permanent
basis  on  August  26,  2020,  which  revised  the  definition  of  eligible  retained
income  for  all  U.S.  banking  organizations.  The  revised  definition  of  eligible
retained income makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions, where
a banking organization's regulatory ratios were to decline below the respective
minimum requirements, take effect on a more gradual basis.
Following the launch of the MMLF program, which we participated in, the
Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule on March 19, 2020 (followed by a
final rule on September 29, 2020), allowing Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) to
exclude  assets  purchased  with  the  MMLF  program  from  their  RWA,  total
leverage  exposure  and  average  total  consolidated  assets.  No  new  credit
extensions were made after March 31, 2021, as the program had expired.
On  March  27,  2020,  the  BCBS  announced  the  deferral  of  the
implementation of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023.
As of now, the U.S. federal banking agencies have not formally proposed the
implementation of the BCBS revisions.
Effective  April  1,  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  federal
banking agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes a
deduction  for  qualifying  central  bank  deposits  from  a  custodial  bankingorganization’s total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amountof  funds  the  custodial  banking  organization  and  its  consolidated  subsidiarieshave  on  deposit  at  qualifying  central  banks  and  (ii)  the  total  amount  of  clientfunds  on  deposit  at  the  custodial  banking  organization  that  are  linked  tofiduciary  or  custodial  and  safekeeping  accounts.  For  the  quarter  endedSeptember  30,  2021,  we  deducted  $77.2  billion  of  average  balances  held  ondeposit  at  central  banks  from  the  denominator  used  in  the  calculation  of  ourSLR, based on this custodial banking deduction.
On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal bankingagencies issued a final rule that will require us and State Street Bank to makecertain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecureddebt  instruments,  including  eligible  LTD  under  the  TLAC  rule,  issued  by  theParent  Company  and  other  U.S.  and  foreign  G-SIBs.  The  final  rule  becameeffective on April 1, 2021.
In  light  of  considerable  economic  uncertainty  created  by  the  COVID-19pandemic,  all  participating  CCAR  banking  organizations  were  required  toresubmit their capital plans by November 2, 2020, based on updated scenariosprovided by the Federal Reserve on September 17, 2020.In light of the decision to administer a new stress test, the Federal Reservelimited  the  ability  of  all  CCAR  banking  organizations  to  make  capitaldistributions  in  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020,  although  bankingorganizations were permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levelsprovided such distributions did not exceed an amount determined by a formulabased on the banking organization's recent income. As a result, CCAR bankingorganizations, including us, were not permitted to return capital to shareholdersin  the  form  of  common  share  repurchases  during  the  third  quarter  and  fourthquarter of 2020.
On December 18, 2020, following the release of a second round of stresstest  results  for  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  modified  the  restrictions  on  capitaldistributions  for  the  first  quarter  of  2021.  Common  stock  dividends  and  sharerepurchases in the first quarter of 2021 were limited to the average of our netincome  for  the  four  preceding  quarters  plus  a  number  of  shares  equal  to  theshare  issuances  in  the  quarter  related  to  expensed  employee  compensation,provided that we did not increase the amount of our common stock dividends tobe larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020. On March 25, 2021,the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions through the second quarter of2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOn June 24, 2021, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2021 supervisory stress test. Our SCB calculated under this year's supervisorystress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will go into effect starting October 1, 2021 and run through September 30, 2022. TheFederal  Reserve  also  lifted  the  restrictions  on  capital  distributions  implemented  in  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  we  are  currently  governed  in  our  capitaldistributions by minimum capital requirements inclusive of SCB.

In  September  2021,  we  completed  a  public  offering  of  approximately  21.7  million  shares  of  our  common  stock.  The  offering  price  was  $87.60  per  share  and  netproceeds totaled approximately $1.9 billion. We expect to use these net proceeds to finance our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business.In June 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2019 CCAR submission; and in connection with that capital plan,our Board approved a common share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020(the 2019 Program). We repurchased $500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program.
On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As aresult,  we  had  no  repurchases  of  our  common  stock  in  the  second,  third  or  fourth  quarters  of  2020.  In  December  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  issued  results  of  2020resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021.We repurchased $475 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the repurchaseof up to $425 million of our common stock through June 30, 2021, in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. We repurchased $425 million of our commonstock in the second quarter of 2021. In July 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our common stock through theend of 2022.
In connection with our proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business, we did not repurchase any common stock during the third quarter of 2021 under thecommon share repurchase plan approved by our Board in July 2021, and we do not intend to repurchase any common stock during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the firstquarter of 2022. We intend to resume our common share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022.

On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnifyour clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantialvolume  of  these  activities  necessitates  detailed  credit-based  underwriting  and  monitoring  processes.  The  aggregate  amount  of  indemnified  securities  on  loan  totaled$402.37 billion and $440.88 billion as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, forwhich we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amountin excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are notrecorded in our consolidated statement of condition.
