Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (Form 10-Q), unless the
context requires otherwise, references to "State Street,"  "we," "us," "our" or similar
terms  mean  State  Street  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries  on  a  consolidated  basis.
The  Parent  Company  is  a  source  of  financial  and  managerial  strength  to  our
subsidiaries.  Through  our  subsidiaries,  including  our  principal  banking  subsidiary,
State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street Bank, we provide

with $40.26 trillion of AUC/A and $3.59 trillion of AUM as of March 31, 2021.
As  of  March  31,  2021,  we  had  consolidated  total  assets  of  $316.89  billion,
consolidated total deposits of $244.89 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity
of $25.01 billion and 39,318 employees. We operate in more than 100 geographic

Our operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing

Additional  information  about  our  lines  of  business  is  provided  in  Line  of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
This  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  part  of  the  Form  10-Q  and
updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2020 Annual Report on
Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  previously  filed  with  the  SEC
(2020  Form  10-K).  You  should  read  the  financial  information  contained  in  this
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  and  elsewhere  in  this  Form  10-Q  in
conjunction with the financial and other information contained in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Certain  previously  reported  amounts  presented  in  this  Form  10-Q  have  been
reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.
We  prepare  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
GAAP.  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affectthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.The  significant  accounting  policies  that  require  us  to  make  judgments,estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters thatare uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:• accounting for fair value measurements; • impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;• contingencies; and• allowance for credit losses.
These  significant  accounting  policies  require  the  most  subjective  or  complexjudgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revisionas  new  information  becomes  available.  For  additional  information  about  thesesignificant  accounting  policies  refer  to  pages  123  to  125,  “Significant  AccountingEstimates”  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  ofFinancial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  in  our  2020  Form  10-K  andSignificant  Accounting  Estimates  in  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q. We did not changethese significant accounting policies in the first three months of 2021.Certain  financial  information  provided  in  this  Form  10-Q,  including  in  thisManagement's  Discussion  and  Analysis,  is  prepared  on  both  a  U.S.  GAAP,  orreported basis, and a non-GAAP basis. We measure and compare certain financialinformation  on  a  non-GAAP  basis,  including  information  that  management  uses  inevaluating our business and activities.
Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not asa substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with U.S.GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-Q, includingthis  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,  is  reconciled  to  its  most  directlycomparable U.S. GAAP-basis measure.
We  further  believe  that  our  presentation  of  FTE  NII,  a  non-GAAP  measure,which  reports  non-taxable  revenue,  such  as  interest  income  associated  with  taxexempt investment securities, on a FTE basis, facilitates an investor's understandingand analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.We  provide  additional  disclosures  required  by  applicable  bank  regulatorystandards, includingState Street Corporation | 4

In  this  Management’sDiscussion  and  Analysis,  where  we  describe  the  effects  of  changes  in  foreigncurrency  translation,  those  effects  are  determined  by  applying  applicable  weightedaverage FX rates from the relevant 2020 period to the relevant 2021 period results.Financial Results and Highlights• First quarter of 2021 financial performance: ◦ Total fee revenue was up 4% in the first quarter of 2021, comparedto  the  same  period  in  2020,  including  2%  due  to  currencytranslation. ◦ Servicing  fee  revenues  were  up  7%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,compared to the same period in 2020, including 3% due to currencytranslation.  Management  fee  revenues  were  up  6%  in  the  firstquarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, including 2%due to currency translation. ◦ EPS of $1.37 in the first quarter of 2021 decreased 15% comparedto  $1.62  in  the  same  period  in  2020,  driven  by  lower  net  interestincome and higher expenses. ◦ In the first quarter of 2021, return on equity of 8.4% decreased from10.9% in the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in netincome available to common shareholders. Pre-tax margin of 21.3%in the first quarter of 2021 decreased from 25.3% in the same periodin  2020,  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  total  revenue  and  anincrease in total expenses. ◦ Operating  leverage  was  (7.2)%  points  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021.Operating  leverage  represents  the  difference  between  thepercentage change in total revenue and the percentage change intotal expenses,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSin each case relative to the prior year period. • During the first quarter of 2021, our business and financial results continued
to reflect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic: ◦ Approximately  80%  of  our  employees  globally  continue  to  work
remotely as of March 31, 2021. ◦ The  Federal  Reserve  Board  announced  in  March  2021  that  it  will
maintain  the  restrictions  on  capital  distributions  of  bank  holding
companies until June 2021. ◦ We continued to experience high levels of client deposits in the first
quarter  of  2021  amidst  the  Federal  Reserve's  expansionary
monetary policy.
Revenue
• Total  revenue  decreased  4%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  compared  to  the
same  period  in  2020,  including  2%  due  to  currency  translation,  as  the
increase in total fee revenue was offset by a decline in NII. Total fee revenue
increased  4%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in
2020,  primarily  driven  by  increases  in  servicing  fees,  management  fees,
securities finance and software and processing fees, partially offset by lower
foreign exchange trading services revenue. • Servicing fee revenue increased 7% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to
the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  higher  average  equity  market
levels,  partially  offset  by  normal  pricing  headwinds.  Currency  translation
increased  servicing  fees  by  3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  relative  to  the
same period in 2020. • Management  fee  revenue  increased  6%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,
compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher average equity
market  levels  and  net  inflows  from  ETFs  and  cash,  partially  offset  by  an
idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation from higher fee products as
a result of a change in their investment strategy and higher money market
fee waivers. Currency translation increased management fees by 2% in the
first quarter of 2021, relative to the same period in 2020. • Foreign  exchange  trading  services  decreased  22%  in  the  first  quarter  of
2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  lower  FX
volatility as compared to the levels
seen at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020,partially offset by higher client FX volumes. • Securities  finance  revenue  increased  8%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021compared to the same period in 2020, reflecting higher agency lending andenhanced custody balances. • Software and processing fees revenue increased 55% in the first quarter of2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  driven  by  highermarket-related adjustments. • NII decreased 30% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same periodin  2020,  primarily  due  to  lower  global  interest  rates  and  the  absence  ofepisodic market-related benefits in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset byhigher deposits reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve’s expansionarymonetary policy, and growth in the investment portfolio.Provision for Credit Losses• The provision for credit losses was a $9 million reserve release in the firstquarter of 2021, compared to an expense of $36 million in the same periodin  2020,  which  reflects  a  shift  in  management’s  economic  outlook  towardeconomic  expansion  and  limited  negative  credit  migration  within  our  loanportfolio.
Expenses
• Total  expenses  increased  3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  compared  to  thesame  period  in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  higher  notable  items.  Currencytranslation increased expenses by 2% in the first quarter of 2021, relative tothe same period in 2020. • The impact of notable items in the first quarter of 2021 includes:◦ legal  and  other  expenses  of  approximately  $29  million,  including$20 million in information systems and communications, $8 million intransaction processing services and $1 million in other expenses.◦ acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  of  approximately  $10  million,primarily related to CRD; and◦ costs  of  $5  million  due  to  the  partial  redemption  of  outstandingSeries F non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock representing thedifference between the redemption value and the net carrying valueof the preferred stock.
State Street Corporation | 8
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS• The impact of notable items in the first quarter of 2020 includes: ◦ acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  of  approximately  $11  million,
primarily related to CRD; and
◦ costs of $9 million due to the redemption of all outstanding Series C
non-cumulative  perpetual  preferred  stock  representing  the
difference between the redemption value and the net carrying value
of the preferred stock.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A of $40.26 trillion increased 26% as of March 31, 2021 compared to
March 31, 2020, primarily due to higher period-end market levels, net new
business  growth  and  client  flows.  In  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  newly
announced  asset  servicing  mandates  totaled  approximately  $343  billion.
Servicing  assets  remaining  to  be  installed  in  future  periods  totaled
approximately  $463  billion  as  of  March  31,  2021,  of  which  approximately
one-third is attributed to State Street Alpha. • AUM  of  $3.59  trillion  increased  34%  as  of  March  31,  2021  compared  to
March  31,  2020,  primarily  due  to  higher  period-end  market  levels  and  net
inflows from ETFs and cash, partially offset by institutional net outflows.
Capital • In the first quarter of 2021, we returned a total of approximately $659 million
to  our  shareholders  in  the  form  of  common  stock  dividends  and  share
repurchases. ◦ We  declared  common  stock  dividends  of  $0.52  per  share,  totaling
$182  million  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  compared  to  $0.52  per
share, totaling $183 million in the first quarter of 2020. ◦ In  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  we  acquired  6.2  million  shares  of
common stock, under a share repurchase program approved by our
Board in January 2021, at an average per share cost of $76.21 and
an aggregate cost of approximately $475 million. In the first quarter
of  2020,  we  acquired  6.5  million  shares  of  common  stock  at  an
average  per  share  cost  of  $77.35  and  an  aggregate  cost  of
approximately $500 million.
▪ In  April  2021,  our  Board  authorized  a  share  repurchase  program  for  thepurchase of up to $425 million of our common stock through June 30, 2021,in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve.• Our CET1 capital ratio decreased to 10.8% as of March 31, 2021, comparedto 12.3% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to an episodic increase inrisk-weighted assets related to FX trading and overdraft activity, as well aslower  capital  related  to  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  andintangible assets. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 5.4% as of March31, 2021 compared to 6.4% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to anincrease  in  adjusted  average  assets  driven  by  higher  deposits,  partiallyoffset  by  higher  retained  earnings.  As  of  both  March  31,  2021  andDecember 31, 2020, standardized capital ratios were binding.Capital Redemptions

 The impact  of State  Street  Global Advisors  gross money market  fund fee waivers  on management fee revenue was
approximately $15 million in the first quarter of 2021, with an additional approximately $10 million of gross money market
fund fee waivers attributable to other fee revenue lines in the same period.

Fee Revenue
Table  2:  Total  Revenue,  provides  the  breakout  of  fee  revenue  for  the  firstquarters  of  2021  and  2020.  Servicing  and  management  fees  collectively  made  upapproximately 75% and 73% of the total fee revenue in the first quarters of 2021 and2020, respectively.
Servicing Fee RevenueGenerally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors includingchanges in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business andthe manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to ourclients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration andmiddle  office  services,  and  the  nature  and  mix  of  services  provided  affects  ourservicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients.Changes in Market ValuationsOur  servicing  fee revenue  is impacted  by both our levels and the geographicand product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have acorresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, thoughthe degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geographyof assets held within our clients’ portfolios.
Over  the  five  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  we  estimate  that  worldwidemarket valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 5%annually. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End EquityIndices  for  selected  indices.  While  the  specific  indices  presented  are  indicative  ofgeneral  market  trends,  the  asset  types  and  classes  relevant  to  individual  clientportfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices andof client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented.In  addition,  our  asset  classifications  may  differ  from  those  industry  classificationspresented.
Assuming  that  all  other  factors  remain  constant,  including  client  activity  andasset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31, 2021that  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  worldwide  equity  valuations,  on  a  weightedaverage basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated,would  result  in  a  corresponding  change  in  our  total  servicing  fee  revenues,  onaverage  and  over  multiple  quarters,  of  approximately  3%.  We  estimate,  similarlyassuming all other factors constant and using relevant information as of March 31,2021, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted averagebasis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have asmaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.(1)

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wiretransfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, includingtransaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five yearsended December 31, 2020, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 2% annually. See Table 5: IndustryAsset  Flows for  selected  asset  flow  information.  While  the  asset  flows  presented  are  indicative  of general  market  trends,  the  asset  types  and classes  relevant  to individual  clientportfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.TABLE 5: INDUSTRY ASSET FLOWS

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet New Business
Over  the  five  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  net  new  business,  which
includes  business  both  won  and  lost,  has  affected  our  servicing  fee  revenues  by
approximately 2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually. Gross investment
servicing mandates were $343 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and $1.3 trillion per
year on average over the past five years. Over the five years ended December 31,
2020, gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from $750 billion to nearly
$2.0 trillion.
New  business  impacting  servicing  fees  can  include:  custody;  product
accounting;  daily  valuation  and  administration;  record-keeping;  cash  management;
and  other  services.  Revenues  associated  with  new  servicing  mandates  may  vary
based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and
the types of assets installed.
Revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee
revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can
range from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately
9  to  12  months  over  the  2  years  ended  December  31,  2020.  Our  more  complex
installations,  including  new  State  Street  Alpha  mandates,  will  generally  be  on  the
longer end of that range.
Pricing
The  industry  in  which  we  operate  has  historically  faced  pricing  pressure,  and
our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently,
no  assumption  should  be  drawn  as  to  future  revenue  run  rate  from  announced
servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially.
On average, over the five years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that pricing
pressure  with  respect  to  existing  clients  has  impacted  our  servicing  fees  by
approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given
year.  Pricing  concessions  can  be  a  part  of  a  contract  renegotiation  with  a  client
including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the terms of our relationship
with  the  client,  expanding  the  scope  of  services  that  we  provide  or  reducing  our
dependency  on  manual  processes  through  the  standardization  of  the  services  we
provide.  The  timing  of  the  impact  of  additional  revenue  generated  by  anticipated
additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from the impact
of  pricing  concessions  on  existing  services  due  to  the  necessary  time  required  to
onboard  those  new  services,  the  nature  of  those  services  and  client  investment
practices. These same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we
win business from new clients.
In  order  to  offset  the  typical  client  attrition  and  normal  pricing  headwinds,  weestimate  that  we  need  at  least  $1.5  trillion  of  new  AUC/A  per  year;  although,notwithstanding increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to several factors,including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner inwhich we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and the type ofservices and the other factors described in Item 1A, "Risk Factors", in our 2020 Form10-K.
Historically,  and  based  on  an  indicative  sample  of  revenue,  we  estimate  thatapproximately  55%,  on average,  of our servicing  fee revenues have been variabledue to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations ofAUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volumeof  activity  in  the  funds  we  serve;  and  the  remaining  approximately  30%  of  ourservicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations orvalues.
The impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business andpricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix ofproducts and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in marketvaluations and the volume  of activity  in the funds may  not be fully reflected  in ourservicing  fee  revenues  in  the  periods  in  which  the  changes  occur,  particularly  inperiods of higher volatility.
Management Fee RevenueManagement fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we reportbased  on  month-end  valuations.  Management  fees  for  certain  components  ofmanaged  assets,  such  as  ETFs,  mutual  funds  and  UCITS,  are  affected  by  dailyaverage  valuations  of  AUM.  Management  fee  revenue  is  more  sensitive  to  marketvaluations  than  servicing  fee  revenue,  as  a  higher  proportion  of  the  underlyingservices provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent onequity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relativemix  of  assets  managed,  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  our  management  feerevenue.  While  certain  management  fees  are  directly  determined  by  the  values  ofAUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect otherfactors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricingfor clients. In addition, in a prolonged low-interest rate environment, such as we arecurrently experiencing, we have waived and may in the future waive certain fees forour clients for money market products.
The  impact  of  State  Street  Global  Advisors  gross  money  market  fund  feewaivers on total management fee revenue was approximately $15 million in the firstquarter of 2021; however, we anticipate that gross money market fee waivers willState Street Corporation | 12
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSbe  higher  in  subsequent  quarters  of  2021.  As  of  March  31,  2021,  and  assuming
short-term spot interest rates and the amount of money market fund assets remain
constant,  we  estimate  that  the  impact  of  gross  money  market  fee  waivers  on  our
management fees would be approximately $35 million per quarter. We believe that a
further  decline  in  short-term  interest  rates,  primarily  one-  and  three-month  interest
rates,  to  zero  would  not  materially  impact  this  estimate.  Alternatively,  if  short-terminterest rates were to rise by approximately 10bps, the impact of gross money market
fee waivers on our management fees would be largely mitigated in the subsequent
quarterly periods.
Asset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our
AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUMthan  for  actively  managed  products.  Actively  managed  products  may  also  include
performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on
predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of March 31,
2021  and  assuming  that  all  other  factors  remain  constant,  including  the  impact  of
business won and lost and client flows, that: • A 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted
average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are
calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management
fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%;
and
• A  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  worldwide  fixed-income  valuations,  on  a
weighted  average  basis,  over  the  relevant  periods  for  which  our
management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in
our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters,
of approximately 4%.
Daily  averages,  month-end  averages  and  quarter-end  indices  demonstrate
worldwide  changes  in  equity  and  debt  markets  that  affect  our  management  fee
revenue. Quarter-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table
3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Quarter-End Equity Indices for selected
indices.
Additional  information  about  fee  revenue  is  provided  under  "Line  of  Business
Information" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Net Interest Income
See Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of
interest income and interest expense for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020.NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interestexpense  incurred  on  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Interest-earning  assets,  whichprincipally  consist  of  investment  securities,  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks,loans,  resale  agreements  and  other  liquid  assets,  are  financed  primarily  by  clientdeposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
NIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average totalinterest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by averageinterest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earnedfrom certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to aFTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.NII on a FTE basis decreased in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the sameperiod  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  lower  global  interest  rates  and  the  absence  ofepisodic market-related benefits in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by growthin deposits and the investment portfolio.
Investment  securities  net  premium  amortization,  which  is  included  in  interestincome, was $169 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $108 million in thesame  period  in  2020.  The  increase  is  primarily  driven  by  higher  MBS  premiumamortization as a result of lower interest rates and faster prepayments.Interest  income  related  to  debt  securities  is  recognized  in  our  consolidatedstatement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximatinga level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The rate ofreturn considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums ordiscounts,  resulting  in  amortization  or  accretion,  accordingly.  The  amortization  ofpremiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments when they occur,which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.

 Average rate includes the impact of FX swap costs of approximately ($21) million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to ($2) million for the same period in 2020. Average rates for total interest-bearing deposits excluding the impact of FX swap costs were(0.11)% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 0.19% in the same period in 2020.
 Total deposits averaged $226.23 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $180.16 billion in the same period in 2020.
Changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the components of interestincome and interest expense is provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
Average total interest-earning assets were $254.73 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $206.63 billion in the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily due tohigher interest-bearing deposits with banks and investment securities.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $95.24 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $67.12 billion in the same period in 2020. These deposits primarily reflect ourmaintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The higher levels of average cash balances with centralbanks reflect higher levels of client deposits.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSecurities  purchased  under  resale  agreements  averaged  $4.57  billion  in  the
first quarter of 2021 compared to $1.81 billion in the same period in 2020. The impact
of balance sheet netting decreased to $87.37 billion on average in the first quarter of
2021 compared  to  $123.96  billion  in  the  same  period  in  2020.  We  maintain  an
agreement with Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a clearing organization
that enables us to net all securities sold under repurchase agreements against those
purchased  under  resale  agreements  with  counterparties  that  are  also  members  of
the clearing organization. The decrease in average balance sheet netting in the first
quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 is primarily due to lower FICC
repo  volumes  from  an  increased  cash  supply  and  lower  short-term  interest  rates
driven  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  stimulus  measures  and  Federal  Reserve
intervention.
We have been a sponsoring member within FICC since 2005 and continue to
expand  our  client  base  as  program  eligibility  parameters  broaden.  We  enter  into
repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and
with  other  FICC  members  and,  pursuant  to  FICC  Government  Securities  Division
rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their
eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the
prompt  and  full  payment  and  performance  of  our  sponsored  member  clients’
respective obligations. We obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the
high quality securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our
potential exposure to FICC.
Average investment securities increased to $107.81 billion in the first quarter of
2021  from  $97.56  billion  in  the  same  period  in  2020  primarily  driven  by  MBS
balances  and  foreign  government  bonds.  The  growth  reflects  our  deployment  of
higher structural deposit levels that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Loans averaged $28.03 billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $28.47
billion in the same period in 2020. Average core loans, which exclude overdrafts and
highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged $23.80 billion in the first
quarter of 2021 compared to $22.18 billion in the same period in 2020.
Average  other  interest-earning  assets,  largely  associated  with  our  enhanced
custody business, increased to $18.30 billion in the first quarter of 2021 from $10.76
billion in the same period in 2020, primarily driven by an increase in the level of cash
collateral posted.  Enhanced custody  is our securities  financing business where we
act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance
revenue. The NII earned on these
transactions  is  generally  lower  than  the  interest  earned  on  other  alternativeinvestments.
Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $179.41 billionin the first quarter of 2021 from $144.59 billion in the same period in 2020. AverageU.S. interest-bearing deposits increased as a result of the market uncertainty due tothe COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. monetary policy and the level of global interest rates.We expect deposits to remain elevated within the current environment of low-interestrates and continued expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve. Futuredeposit  levels  will  be  influenced  by  the  underlying  asset  servicing  business,  clientdeposit behavior and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and nonU.S. interest rates.
Average other short-term borrowings, typically associated with our tax-exemptinvestment program, decreased to $0.76 billion in the first quarter of 2021 from $2.96billion in the same period in 2020.
Average long-term debt was $13.82 billion in the first quarter of 2021 comparedto  $13.29  billion  in  the  same  period  in  2020.  These  amounts  reflect  issuances,redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods, including theissuance of $850 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated debt inMarch 2021.
Average other interest-bearing liabilities were $4.85 billion in the first quarter of2021 compared  to $3.43 billion in the same  period in 2020. Other  interest-bearingliabilities  primarily  reflect  our  level  of  cash  collateral  received  from  clients  inconnection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basiswhere we have enforceable netting agreements.
Several factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volumeand mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheetmanagement activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interestrates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretationsof those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yieldsearned on securities sold or matured; and changes in the type and amount of creditor other loans we extend.
Based on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards,we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturitiesof investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as federalagency  MBS,  sovereign  debt  securities  and  U.S.  Treasury  and  agency  securities.The pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased willdepend on the impact of market conditions, theState Street Corporation | 15
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSimplementation  of  regulatory  standards,  including  interpretation  of  those  standards
and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest
rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.
Provision for Credit Losses
The  provision  for  credit  losses  was  a  $9  million  reserve  release  in  the  first
quarter  of  2021,  which  reflects  a  shift  in  management’s  economic  outlook  toward
economic  expansion  and  limited  negative  credit  migration  within  our  loan  portfolio.
This compares to a $36 million provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2020.

Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses were $176 million in the
first quarter of 2021 compared to $151 million in the same period in 2020.
Total headcount was flat as of March 31, 2021 compared to March 31, 2020,
primarily driven by hiring in global hubs, offset by a reduction in high cost locations.
Information  systems  and  communications  expenses  increased  9%  in  the  firstquarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was primarilyrelated to higher software costs and technology infrastructure investments, as well asthe impact of notable items.

Other  expenses  decreased  3%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  compared  to  thesame period in 2020, primarily driven by lower travel costs.Acquisition Costs
We  recorded  approximately  $11  million  of  acquisition  costs  in  both  the  firstquarters of 2021 and 2020, related to our acquisition of CRD. As we integrate CRDinto  our  business,  we  expect  to  incur  a  total  of  approximately  $225  million  ofacquisition costs through 2021, after which we will no longer distinguish certain CRDcosts as acquisition costs. As of March 31, 2021, we have incurred $175 million ofacquisition  costs  related  to  CRD.  We  expect  to  incur  any  remaining  significantacquisition costs related to CRD in 2021.

Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the first quarter of 2021 totaled approximately $343 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaledapproximately $463 billion as of March 31, 2021, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods.Approximately one-third of servicing assets to be installed as of March 31, 2021 were attributed to State Street Alpha. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized overseveral quarters as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. Newasset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yetprovided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will beincluded in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates andservicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the periodof their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring,custody, depository banking services, FX, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estateadministration, securities finance, transfer agency and wealth management services. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of servicesprovided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.
As a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its ETF assets currently with StateStreet to one or more other providers, pending necessary approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client tocontinue to be meaningful to our business. The transition is expected to begin in 2022 but will principally occur in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fee revenueassociated with the transitioning assets represented approximately 1.5% of our total fee revenue. The total revenue and income impact of this transition will depend upon a range offactors, including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFor  additional  information  about  the  impact  of  worldwide  equity  and  fixedincome valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing
fee  revenue,  refer  to  "Fee  Revenue"  in  "Consolidated  Results  of  Operations"
included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign  exchange  trading  services  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:
Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, decreased 23% in the first quarter of
2021 compared  to the same period in 2020, primarily  due to lower FX volatility  as
compared to the levels seen at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first
quarter  of  2020,  partially  offset  by  higher  client  FX  volumes.  Foreign  exchange
trading  services  is  composed  of  revenue  generated  by  FX  trading  and  revenue
generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 70% and 30%,
respectively,  of  foreign  exchange  trading  services  revenue  in  the  first  quarter  of
2021, compared to 76% and 24%, respectively, in the same period in 2020.
We  primarily  earn  FX  trading  revenue  by  acting  as  a  principal  market-maker
through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.” • Direct sales and trading: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with
clients  and  investment  managers  that  contact  our  trading  desk  directly.
These  principal  market-making  activities  include  transactions  for  funds
serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds
under custody with us. • Indirect  FX  trading:  Represents  FX  transactions  with  clients,  for  which  we
are  the  funds'  custodian,  or  their  investment  managers,  routed  to  our  FX
desk through our asset-servicing  operation. We execute indirect FX trades
as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.
Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume
and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting
market  conditions;  and  our  management  of  exchange  rate,  interest  rate  and  other
market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on
our  total  FX  trading  revenues  often  differs  from  period  to  period.  For  example,
assuming  all  other  factors  remain  constant,  increases  or  decreases  in  volumes  or
bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the
case may be, in client-related FX revenue.
Our clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX
transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading
to either direct sales and trading
execution,  including  our  “Street  FX”  service,  or  to  one  of  our  electronic  tradingplatforms.  Street  FX,  in  which  we  continue  to  act  as  a  principal  market-maker,enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX tradeexecution  process,  both  for  funds  under  custody  with  us  as  well  as  those  undercustody at another bank.
We also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through "electronic FXservices" and "other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue."• Electronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactionsthrough one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions generaterevenue through a “click” fee. • Other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our clientslook  to  us  to  enhance  and  preserve  portfolio  values,  they  may  choose  toutilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or transact withour Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which are not limitedto foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions charged for tradestransacted during the management of these portfolios.Securities FinanceOur securities finance business consists of three components:(1)  an  agency  lending  program  for  State  Street  Global  Advisors  managedinvestment  funds  with  a  broad  range  of  investment  objectives,  which  werefer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;(2)  an  agency  lending  program  for  third-party  investment  managers  and  assetowners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we referto as our enhanced custody business.
Securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which iscomposed  of  our  split  of  both  the  spreads  related  to  cash  collateral  and  the  feesrelated to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities onloan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and ourshare of the fee split.
As  principal,  our  enhanced  custody  business  borrows  securities  from  thelending  client  or  other  market  participants  and  then  lends  such  securities  to  thesubsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal whenthe lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with theState Street Corporation | 19
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSmarket and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal,
we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a
significant  proportion  of  the securities  furnished  by us  in our role  as principal  fromthird parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody
from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.
Securities finance revenue, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line
of Business Results, increased 7% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same
period in 2020, driven by higher agency lending and enhanced custody balances.
Market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance,
and  as  a  result  our  revenue  from,  and  the  profitability  of,  our  securities  lending
activities  in  future  periods.  In  addition,  the  constantly  evolving  regulatory
environment,  including  revised  or  proposed  capital  and  liquidity  standards,
interpretations  of  those  standards,  and  our  own  balance  sheet  management
activities,  may  influence  modifications  to  the  way  in  which  we  deliver  our  agency
lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity
and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
Software and Processing Fees
Software  and  processing  fees  revenue  includes  diverse  types  of  fees  and
revenue,  including  fees  from  software  licensing  and  maintenance,  fees  from  our
structured  products  business  and  other  revenue  including  equity  income  from  our
joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of other assets, market-related
adjustments and income associated with certain tax-advantaged investments.
Software  and  processing  fees  revenue,  presented  in  Table  10:  Investment
Servicing  Line  of  Business  Results,  increased  26%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021
compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  and  reflects  approximately  $87  million  fromCRD in the first quarter of 2021, compared to approximately $91 million from CRD in
the same period in 2020. Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by
CRD is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and software as service
arrangements,  including  professional  services  such  as  consulting  and
implementation  services,  software  support  and  maintenance.  Approximately  50%-
70%  of  revenue  associated  with  a  sale  of  software  to  be  installed  on-premises  is
recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to
and use of the software license, with the percentage
varying  based  on  the  length  of  the  contract  and  other  contractual  terms.  Theremainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length of thecontract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon renewal of an onpremises software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the balance recognized over the term of thecontract. Revenue for a Software as a Service (SaaS) related arrangement, wherethe customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the termof  the  contract  as  services  are  provided.  Upon  renewal  of  a  SaaS  arrangement,revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract.As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are accounted for,CRD  revenue  may  vary  more  than  other  business  units  quarter  to  quarter.  CRDcontributed  approximately  $90  million  in  total  revenue  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,compared to approximately $95 million the same period in 2020, which included in2021  approximately  $91  million  in  software  and  processing  fees  and  $4  million  inbrokerage and other trading services within foreign exchange trading services.Amortization  of  tax  advantage  investments  negatively  impacted  software  andprocessing fees by approximately $26 million and $23 million in the first quarters of2021and 2020, respectively.
In addition, FX and market-related adjustments, which also includes certain fairvalue  adjustments,  negatively  impacted  software  and  processing  fees  byapproximately  $4  million  and  $21  million  in  the  first  quarters  of  2021  and  2020,respectively.
Expenses
Total  expenses  for  Investment  Servicing  increased  1%  in  the  first  quarter  of2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher notable items andseasonal  expenses.  Currency  translation  increased  expenses  for  InvestmentServicing  by  2%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  relative  to  the  same  period  in  2020.Seasonal  deferred  incentive  compensation  expense  and  payroll  taxes  were$141 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $125 million in the same periodin  2020.  Total  expenses  contributed  by  CRD  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  wereapproximately  $67  million,  compared  to  $58  million  to  the  same  period  in  2020.Additional  information  about  expenses  is  provided  under  "Expenses"  in"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion andAnalysis.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExpenses
Total expenses for Investment Management increased 3% in in the first quarter
of  2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  higher  seasonal
expenses,  partially  offset  by  lower  delivery  costs  and  an  idiosyncratic  client  asset
reallocation.  Seasonal  deferred  incentive  compensation  expense  and  payroll  taxes
were  $35  million  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  compared  to  $26  million  in  the  same
period  in  2020.  Currency  translation  increased  expenses  for  Investment
Management by 2% in the first quarter of 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.
Additional  information  about  expenses  is  provided  under  "Expenses"  in
"Consolidated Results of Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and
Analysis.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by
the  liabilities  generated  by  our  Investment  Servicing  and  Investment  Management
lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance
sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their worldwide
cash  management  and  investment  activities,  they  utilize  deposits  and  short-terminvestments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally
in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated
in  a  variety  of  currencies;  non-interest-bearing  demand  deposits;  and  repurchase
agreements,  which  generally  serve  as  short-term  investment  alternatives  for  our
clients.
Deposits  and  other  liabilities  resulting  from  client  initiated  transactions  are
invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than
our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek
to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational
in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our assets
consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration
financial  instruments,  such  as  interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and  securities
purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the
characteristics  of  the  client  liabilities  and  our  desire  to  maintain  a  well-diversified
portfolio of high-quality assets.

Average duration of our investment securities portfolio was 3.1 years and 3.0years as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase insecurities  duration  is  primarily  driven  by  slower  prepayment  speeds  amidst  higherlong-end interest rates.

finance  loans  and  $832  million  loans  to  business  development  companies  as  of  March  31,  2021,  compared  to
$6,391 million loans to real money funds, $8,380 million private equity capital call finance loans and $821 million loans to
business development companies as of December 31, 2020.

March 31, 2021 and $1,911 million securities finance loans, $754 million loans to municipalities and $54 million other loans as of December 31, 2020.
 As of March 31, 2021, floating rate loans totaled $21,118 million and fixed rate loans totaled $3,003 million.
The increase in domestic loans in the commercial and financial segment as of
March  31,  2021  compared  to  December  31,  2020  was  primarily  driven  by  an
increase in overdrafts.
As  of  March  31,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,  our  leveraged  loans  totaled
approximately  $4.21  billion  and  $4.17  billion,  respectively.  We  sold  $42  million  of
leveraged loans in the first quarter of 2021, of which $7 million remained unsettled
and was held for sale as of March 31, 2021.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2020 of $466 million and $149 million, respectively, to participate in
such syndications. Additional information about these unfunded
commitments  is provided  in Note 9 to the consolidated  financial  statements  in thisForm 10-Q.
These  leveraged  loans,  which  are  primarily  rated  “speculative”  under  ourinternal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statementsin this Form 10-Q), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with approximately 86%and  85%  of  the  loans  rated  “BB”  or  “B”  as  of  March  31,  2021  and  December  31,2020, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investmentto  larger,  more  liquid  credits  underwritten  by  major  global  financial  institutions,applying  our  internal  credit  analysis  process  to  each  potential  investment  anddiversifying  our  exposure  by  counterparty  and  industry  segment.  However,  theseloans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in ourportfolio.
Additional  information  about  all  of  our  loan  segments,  as  well  as  underlyingclasses, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form10-Q.
No  loans  were  modified  in  troubled  debt  restructurings  as  of  both  March  31,2021 and December 31, 2020.

 The charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans.
The  provision  for  credit  losses  related  to  loans  and  financial  assets  held  atamortized  cost,  including  investment  securities  classified  as  HTM  and  off-balancesheet  commitments,  was  a  $9  million  reserve  release  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,compared to $36 million in the same period in 2020.
As  of  March  31,  2021,  approximately  $92  million  of  our  allowance  for  creditlosses  was  related  to  leveraged  loans  included  in  the  commercial  and  financialsegment  compared  to  $83  million  as  of  March  31,  2020.  The  reduction  in  theallowance  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  reflects  a  shift  in  management’s  economicoutlook toward economic expansion and limited negative credit migration within ourloan portfolio.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSscenarios  change,  our  allowance  for  credit  losses  related  to  these  loans  may  be
impacted  through  a  change  to  the  provisions  for  credit  losses,  reflecting  credit
migration  within  our  loan  portfolio,  as  well  as  changes  in  management's  economic
outlook as of year-end. The remaining $43 million and $41 million as of March 31,
2021  and  2020,  respectively,  was  related  to  off-balance  sheet  commitments  and
other financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities held to
maturity.
An allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities upon acquisition
of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair value and expected future cash
flows  of  the  investment  securities  are  less  than  their  amortized  cost  basis.  Our
assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific
factors.  Such  factors  are  based  on  estimates,  derived  by  management,  which
contemplate  current  market  conditions  and  security-specific  performance.  To  the
extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations or due to
idiosyncratic  bond  performance,  the  credit-related  component  of  impairment,  in
particular, could increase and would be recorded in the provision for credit losses.
Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment
losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border Outstandings
Cross-border  outstandings  are  amounts  payable  to  us  by  non-U.S.
counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-local currency, as
well  as  non-U.S.  local  currency  claims  not  funded  by  local  currency  liabilities.  Our
cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease
financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related
to  FX  and  interest  rate  contracts;  and  securities  finance.  In addition to credit  risk,
cross-border  outstandings  have  the  risk  that,  as  a  result  of  political  or  economic
conditions  in  a  country,  borrowers  may  be  unable  to  meet  their  contractual
repayment  obligations  of  principal  and/or  interest  when  due  because  of  the
unavailability  of,  or  restrictions  on,  FX  needed  by  borrowers  to  repay  their
obligations.
As market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit rating
agencies  may  downgrade  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  financial  institutions  and  sovereign
issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us,
or  whose  financial  instruments  serve  as  collateral  on  which  we  rely  for  credit  risk
mitigation  purposes,  and  may  do  so  again  in  the  future.  As  a  result,  we  may  be
exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.
The  cross-border  outstandings  presented  in  Table  27:  Cross-borderoutstandings,  represented  approximately  26%  and  30%  of  our  consolidated  totalassets as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.TABLE 27: CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS(In millions)

In  the  normal  course  of  our  global  business  activities,  we  are  exposed  to  avariety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specificto our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses on material risks,which include the following: • credit and counterparty risk; • liquidity risk, funding and management; • operational risk; • information technology risk; • market risk associated with our trading activities;• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to asasset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest raterisk;

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS• model risk; • strategic risk; and
• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these
risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are
discussed in detail on pages 24 to 52 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our
2020 Form 10-K.
For  additional  information  about  our  risk  management,  including  our  risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages 85 to 89
included under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or
obligor,  collectively  referred  to  as  a  counterparty,  is  either  unable  or  unwilling  to
repay  borrowings  or  settle  a  transaction  in  accordance  with  underlying  contractual
terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as
overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio,
where  recourse  to  a  counterparty  exists,  and  in  our  direct  and  indirect  trading
activities,  such  as  securities  purchased  under  a  resale  agreement,  principal
securities  lending  and  FX  and  indemnified  agency  securities  lending.  We  also
assume  credit  risk  in  our  day-to-day  treasury  and  securities  and  other  settlement
operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central
banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our financial assets held
at  amortized  cost.  We  also  maintain  an  allowance  for  unfunded  commitments  and
letters  of  credit  to  support  our  off-balance  sheet  credit  exposure.  The  two
components  together  represent  the  allowance  for  credit  losses.  Review  and
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout
the  year,  but  occurs  at  least  quarterly,  and  is  based,  among  other  factors,  on  our
evaluation  of  the  level  of  risk  in  the  portfolio  and  the  estimated  effects  of  our
forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple economic scenarios, consisting of
a  baseline,  upside  and  downside  scenarios,  to  develop  management's  forecast  of
future expected losses.
The  economic  forecast  utilized  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021  reflects  a  shift  in
management’s economic outlook toward economic expansion and limited
negative  credit  migration  within  our  loan  portfolio.  Allowance  estimates  remainsubject  to  continued  model  and  economic  uncertainty  and  management  may  usequalitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecastsutilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021, or if creditrisk  migration  is  higher  or  lower  than  forecasted  for  reasons  independent  of  theeconomic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in Note4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.For  additional  information  about  our  credit  risk  management  framework,including our core policies and principles, structure and organization, credit ratings,risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting, monitoring andcontrols, refer to pages 89 to 94 included under Item 7, Management's Discussionand  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  Credit  RiskManagement, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk Management
Our  liquidity  framework  contemplates  areas  of  potential  risk  based  on  ouractivities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidity risk weemploy limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and performroutine stress  testing  to identify  potential  liquidity needs. This process  involves theevaluation  of  a  combination  of  internal  and  external  scenarios  which  assist  us  inmeasuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needsor decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of ourability to access the global capital markets.
We  manage  our  liquidity  on  a  global,  consolidated  basis.  We  also  manageliquidity  on  a  stand-alone  basis  at  our  Parent  Company,  as  well  as  at  certainbranches  and  subsidiaries  of  State  Street  Bank.  State  Street  Bank  generally  hasaccess to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal fundsmarket  and  the  Federal  Reserve's  discount  window.  The  Parent  Company  ismanaged to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access.Additionally,  the Parent Company typically  holds,  or has direct  access  to, primarilythrough  SSIF,  a  direct  subsidiary  of  the  Parent  Company,  and  the  supportagreement,  as  discussed  in  the  "Uses  of  Liquidity"  section  of  this  Management'sDiscussion and Analysis, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cashneeds,  as  well  as  those  projected  over  the  next  one-year  period.  Reference  ourSPOE Strategy as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity" section of this Management'sDiscussion and Analysis. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquidassets available at
State Street Corporation | 28
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSSIF  continue  to  be  available  to  the  Parent  Company.  As  of  March  31,  2021,  our
Parent  Company  and  State  Street  Bank  had  approximately  $0.75  billion  of  senior
notes  or  subordinated  debentures  outstanding  that  will  mature  in  the  next  twelve
months.
As a SIFI, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and
evolving  regulatory  requirements,  including  interpretations  of  those  requirements,
under  specific  U.S.  and  international  regulations  and  also  resulting  from  published
and  unpublished  guidance,  supervisory  activities,  such  as  stress  tests,  resolution
planning,  examinations  and  other  regulatory  interactions.  Satisfaction  of  these
requirements  could,  in  some  cases,  result  in  changes  in  the  composition  of  our
investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business
activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services. If
we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could
receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or
determination  of  a  non-credible  resolution  plan  or  otherwise  receive  an  adverse
regulatory  finding.  Our  efforts  to  satisfy,  or  our  failure  to  satisfy,  these  regulatory
requirements  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  or
results of operations.
For additional information on our liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity
metrics,  refer  to  pages  94  to  99  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion
and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  Liquidity  Risk
Management,  in  our  2020  Form  10-K.  For  additional  information  on  our  liquidity
ratios, including LCR and the net stable funding ratio, refer to page 14 included under
Item 1, Business, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central  to  the  management  of  our  liquidity  is  asset  liquidity,  which  consists
primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in
the LCR. As a banking organization,  we are subject to a minimum  LCR under the
LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is intended to promote the
short-term  resilience  of  internationally  active  banking  organizations,  like  us,  to
improve  the  banking  industry's  ability  to  absorb  shocks  arising  from  market  stress
over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of
liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows.
HQLA  primarily  consists  of  unencumbered  cash  and  certain  high  quality  liquid
securities  that  qualify  for  inclusion  under  the  LCR  rule.  The  LCR  was  fully
implemented beginning on January 1, 2017. We report LCR to the Federal Reserve
daily. For the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and December 31,
2020, daily average LCR for the Parent Company was 107% and 108%, respectively,with the lower daily average LCR for the quarter  ended March 31, 2021 driven byhigher deposits. The average HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR final ruledefinition  was  $158.89  billion  and  $143.61  billion,  post-prescribed  haircuts,  for  thequarters ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increasein  average  HQLA  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2021,  compared  to  the  quarterended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to a higher level of client deposits.We  maintained  average  cash  balances  in  excess  of  regulatory  requirementsgoverning deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately $91.68 billion at theFederal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter endedMarch 31, 2021, and $75.68 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Thehigher  levels  of  average  cash  balances  with  central  banks  reflect  higher  levels  ofclient deposits.
Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged withoutcorresponding  advances  from  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Boston  (FRBB),  theFHLB,  and  other  non-U.S.  central  banks.  State  Street  Bank  is  a  member  of  theFHLB.  This  membership  allows  for  advances  of  liquidity  in  varying  terms  againsthigh-quality  collateral,  which  helps  facilitate  asset-and-liability  management.  As  ofMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings from theFHLB.
Access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities isan  important  source  of  contingent  liquidity  with  utilization  subject  to  underlyingconditions. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had no outstandingprimary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other central bankfacility.
In addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significantamounts  of  other  unencumbered  investment  securities.  These  securities  areavailable sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included inour asset liquidity.
The average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $91.30 billion forthe quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared to $89.12 billion for the quarter endedDecember 31, 2020.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant  uses  of  our  liquidity  could  result  from  the  following:  withdrawals  ofclient  deposits;  draw-downs  by  our  custody  clients  of  lines  of  credit;  advances  toclients  to  settle  securities  transactions;  increases  in  our  investment  and  loanportfolios;  or  other  permitted  purposes.  Such  circumstances  would  generally  ariseunder stress conditions includingState Street Corporation | 29
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSdeterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment
of  HQLA  from  our  investment  portfolio  to  post  collateral  to  financial  institutions
serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program.
We had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts
totaling $34.11 billion and $34.21 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $3.50
billion and $3.33 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
These  amounts  do  not  reflect  the  value  of  any  collateral.  As  of  March  31,  2021,
approximately 72% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 23% of our
standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our commitments are
expected  to  expire  or  renew  without  being  drawn  upon,  the  gross  contractual
amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
State Street, like other bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of
$50 billion or more, periodically submits a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the
event  of material  financial  distress  or failure,  commonly  referred  to as a resolution
plan or a living will, to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the
Dodd-Frank  Act.  Through  resolution  planning,  we  seek,  in  the  event  of  our
insolvency,  to  maintain  State  Street  Bank’s  role  as  a  key  infrastructure  provider
within  the  financial  system,  while  minimizing  risk  to  the  financial  system  and
maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have and will continue to
focus  management  attention  and  resources  to  meet  regulatory  expectations  with
respect to resolution planning.
We  submitted  our  last  2019  165(d)  resolution  plan  filing  that  describes  our
preferred resolution strategy to the Federal Reserve and FDIC (the Agencies) before
July  1,  2019.  In  reviewing  the  2019  plan,  the  Agencies  noted  meaningful
improvements  over  prior  plan  submissions.  The  Agencies  did  not  identify  any
deficiencies  in  the  2019  plan,  but  did  identify  one  shortcoming  related  to  the
implementation of governance mechanisms. We submitted to the Agencies our plan
to remediate this shortcoming in line with the expected timeframe. In addition to the
above  letter,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  FDIC  jointly  issued  a  final  rule  that  was
published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019. This final rule revised the
implementation  requirements  under  the  Dodd  Frank  Act's  resolution  planning
provisions  by  means  of  establishing  a  biennial  filing  cycle  for  the  U.S.  G-SIBs,
including  State  Street.  This  cycle  alternates  between  a  targeted  resolution  plan,
followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agencies have published the
scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan, to include the core elements
of  resolution  planning  and  some  specific  firm  level  information,  including  impactsfrom the COVID-19 pandemic. The next 165(d) resolution plan is a targeted plan tobe submitted by July 1, 2021.
In  the  event  of  material  financial  distress  or  failure,  our  preferred  resolutionstrategy is the SPOE Strategy. For additional information about the SPOE Strategy,refer to pages 18 to 20 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2020 Form 10-K. TheSPOE  Strategy  provides  that  prior  to  the  bankruptcy  of  the  Parent  Company  andpursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF, our BeneficiaryEntities (as defined below) and certain other of our entities, SSIF is obligated, up toits  available  resources,  to  recapitalize  and/or  provide  liquidity  to  State  Street  Bankand  our  other  entities  benefiting  from  such  capital  and/or  liquidity  (collectively  withState  Street  Bank,  “Beneficiary  Entities”),  in  amounts  designed  to  prevent  theBeneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Followingthe recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the ParentCompany  would  enter  into  a  bankruptcy  proceeding  under  the  U.S.  BankruptcyCode. The Beneficiary Entities and our subsidiaries would be transferred to a newlyorganized  holding  company  held  by  a  reorganization  trust  for  the  benefit  of  theParent Company’s claimants.
Under  the  support  agreement,  the  Parent  Company  has  pre-funded  SSIF  bycontributing  certain  of  its  assets  (primarily  its  liquid  assets,  cash  deposits,  debtinvestments,  investments  in  marketable  securities  and  other  cash  and  non-cashequivalent  investments)  to  SSIF  contemporaneous  with  entering  into  the  supportagreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent available, on anon-going  basis.  In  consideration  for  these  contributions,  SSIF  has  agreed  in  thesupport  agreement  to  provide  capital  and  liquidity  support  to  the  Parent  Companyand all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company’s capitaland  liquidity  policies.  Under  the  support  agreement,  the  Parent  Company  is  onlypermitted to retain certain amounts of cash needed to meet its upcoming obligationsand to fund expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has providedthe Parent Company with a committed credit line and issued (and may issue) one ormore promissory notes to the Parent Company (the Parent Company Funding Notes)that together are intended to allow us to continue to meet our obligations throughoutthe period prior to the occurrence of a "Recapitalization Event" (as defined below).The support agreement does not contemplate that SSIF is obligated to maintain anyspecific level of resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implementthe SPOE Strategy.
State Street Corporation | 30
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under
the  Parent  Company  Funding  Notes  would  automatically  convert  into  or  be
exchanged for  capital contributed  to SSIF.  The obligations of the Parent Company
and SSIF  under the support  agreement  are secured through a security  agreement
that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to fulfill
their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a
distinct  legal entity  separate  from  the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s
other affiliates.
In accordance with its policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing basis,
the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and the other Beneficiary Entities.
To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that identifies key
actions  that  would  need  to  be  taken  or  decisions  that  would  need  to  be  made  if
certain events tied to our financial condition occur. In the event that we experience
material financial distress, the support agreement requires us to model and calculate
certain capital and liquidity triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not
the  Parent  Company  should  commence  preparations  for  a  bankruptcy  filing  and
whether or not a Recapitalization Event has occurred.
Upon  the  occurrence  of  a  Recapitalization  Event:  (1)  SSIF  would  not  be
authorized  to  provide  any  further  liquidity  to  the  Parent  Company;  (2)  the  Parent
Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is required
to  contribute  to  SSIF  under  the  support  agreement;  (3)  SSIF  would be required  to
provide  capital  and  liquidity  support  to  the  Beneficiary  Entities  to  support  such
entities’  continued  operation;  and  (4)  the  Parent  Company  would  be  expected  to
commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or
entity,  other  than  a  party  to  the  support  agreement,  should  rely,  including  in
evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective or determining whether to
enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities, on any of our affiliates
being  or  remaining  a  Beneficiary  Entity  or  receiving  capital  or  liquidity  support
pursuant to the support agreement.
A “Recapitalization Event” is defined under the support agreement as the earlier
occurrence  of  one  or  more  capital  and  liquidity  thresholds  being  breached  or  the
authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the Parent Company to
commence bankruptcy proceedings. These thresholds are set at levels intended to
provide  for  the  availability  of  sufficient  capital  and  liquidity  to  enable  an  orderly
resolution  without  extraordinary  government  support.  The  SPOE  Strategy  and  the
obligations under the support  agreement  may  result  in the recapitalization  of State
Street Bank and the
commencement  of  bankruptcy  proceedings  by  the  Parent  Company  at  an  earlierstage  of  financial  stress  than  might  otherwise  occur  without  such  mechanisms  inplace.  An  expected  effect  of  the  SPOE  Strategy  and  applicable  TLAC  regulatoryrequirements  is  that  losses  will  be  imposed  on  the  Parent  Company  shareholdersand  the  holders  of  long-term  debt  and  other  forms  of  TLAC  securities  currentlyoutstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any otherParent Company creditors, before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of thedebt  securities  of  the  Parent  Company's  operating  subsidiaries  or  any  of  theirdepositors or creditors, or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk.There can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our 2019resolution  plan  or  the  support  agreement,  will  not  downgrade,  place  on  negativewatch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generally or on specific debtsecurities. Any such downgrade, placement on negative watch or change in outlookcould adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets orresult  in  restrictive  covenants  in  future  debt  agreements  and  could  also  adverselyimpact the trading prices, or the liquidity, of our outstanding debt securities.State  Street  Bank  is  also  required  to  submit,  periodically  in  accordance  withapplicable  regulations  and  FDIC  guidance,  a  plan  for  resolution  in  the  event  of  itsfailure, referred to as an Insured Depository Institution (IDI) plan. On April 22, 2019,the Federal Register published the FDIC’s advance notice of proposed rulemaking inwhich  it  invited  comment  on  potential  revisions  to  its  IDI  plan  requirements.  Inaddition to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking, on April 16, 2019, the FDICBoard  voted  to  delay  the  next  round  of  submissions  under  the  IDI  Rule  until  therulemaking  process  has  been  completed.  As  of  March  31,  2021,  the  final  IDI  ruleremains pending with no expectation of a required plan submission in 2021.Funding

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSShort-Term Funding
Our  on-balance  sheet  liquid  assets  are  also  an  integral  component  of  our
liquidity  management  strategy.  These  assets  provide  liquidity  through  maturities  of
the  assets,  but  more  importantly,  they  provide  us  with  the  ability  to  raise  funds  by
pledging  the  securities  as  collateral  for  borrowings  or  through  outright  sales.  In
addition,  our  access  to  the  global  capital  markets  gives  us  the  ability  to  source
incremental  funding  from  wholesale  investors.  As  discussed  earlier  under  “Asset
Liquidity,”  State  Street  Bank's  membership  in  the  FHLB  allows  for  advances  of
liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
Short-term  secured  funding  also  comes  in  the  form  of  securities  lent  or  sold
under  agreements  to  repurchase.  These  transactions  are  short-term  in  nature,
generally  overnight  and  are  collateralized  by  high-quality  investment  securities.
These  balances  were  $0.59  billion  and  $3.41  billion  as  of  March  31,  2021  and
December 31, 2020, respectively.
State Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution
of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.11 billion, as of March 31, 2021, to support
its  Canadian  securities  processing  operations.  The  line  of  credit  has  no  stated
termination  date  and  is  cancelable  by  either  party  with  prior  notice.  As  of  both
March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there was no balance outstanding on this
line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We  have  the  ability  to  issue  debt  and  equity  securities  under  our  current
universal  shelf  registration  statement  to  meet  current  commitments  and  business
needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our
clients. The total amount remaining for issuance under the registration statement is
$6.15 billion as of March 31, 2021. In addition, State Street Bank also has current
authorization from the Board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt.
On  March  3,  2021,  we  issued  $850  million  aggregate  principal  amount  of
2.200% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2031.
Agency Credit Ratings
Our  ability  to  maintain  consistent  access  to  liquidity  is  fostered  by  the
maintenance  of  high  investment  grade  ratings  as  measured  by  the  major
independent  credit  rating  agencies.  Factors  essential  to  maintaining  high  credit
ratings include: • diverse and stable core earnings; • relative market position; • strong risk management; • strong capital ratios;
• diverse  liquidity  sources,  including  the  global  capital  markets  and  clientdeposits; • strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offerproducts; • serving markets; and• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.A downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverseeffect on our liquidity by restricting  our ability to access the capital markets,  whichcould  increase  the  related  cost  of  funds.  In  turn,  this  could  cause  the  sudden  andlarge-scale  withdrawal  of  unsecured  deposits  by  our  clients,  which  could  lead  todraw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements undersecurities  purchase  commitments;  or  require  additional  collateral  or  forceterminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
A  majority  of  our  derivative  contracts  have  been  entered  into  under  bilateralagreements  with  counterparties  who  may  require  us  to  post  collateral  or  terminatethe  transactions  based  on  changes  in  our  credit  ratings.  We  assess  the  impact  ofthese arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming adowngrade by all rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination paymentsrelated  to  our  net  derivative  liabilities  under  these  arrangements  that  could  havebeen called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings belowlevels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidated financialstatements  in  this  Form  10-Q.  Other  funding  sources,  such  as  secured  financingtransactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers,could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational  risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed  internalprocesses, people and systems or from external events.In  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  continue  to  have  business  continuityarrangements  in  place  across  our  operating  locations,  and  we,  and  a  significantpercentage  of  our  key  service  providers,  are  operating  significantly  or  entirely  in  awork  from  home  environment.  The  current  operating  environment  increasesoperational risk and information technology risk, including cyber-threats.State Street Corporation | 32

Information Technology Risk Management
We  define  information  technology  risk  as  the  risk  associated  with  the  use,
ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information technology.
Information  technology  risk  includes  risks  triggered  by  technology  non-compliance
with  regulatory  obligations,  information  security  and  privacy  incidents,  business
disruption,  technology  internal  control  and  process  gaps,  technology  operational
events and adoption of new business technologies.

Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could
result  from  broad  market  movements,  such  as  changes  in  the  general  level  of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are
exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or assetand-liability management, activities.
Information  about  the  market  risk  associated  with  our  trading  activities  is
provided  below  under  “Trading  Activities.”  Information  about  the  market  risk
associated  with  our  non-trading  activities,  which  consists  primarily  of  interest  rate
risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”
Trading Activities
In  the  conduct  of  our  trading  activities,  we  assume  market  risk,  the  level  of
which  is  a  function  of  our  overall  risk  appetite,  business  objectives  and  liquidity
needs,  our  clients'  requirements  and  market  volatility  and  our  execution  against
those factors.
For  additional  information  about  the  market  risk  associated  with  our  trading
activities, refer to pages 104 to 105 included under Item 7, Management's Discussion
and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,  "Market  Risk
Management" in our 2020 Form 10-K.
As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange
and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and
entering  into  derivative  instruments,  including  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts,foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  options  and  interest  rate  swaps,  interest  rateforward  contracts  and  interest  rate  futures.  As  of  March  31,  2021,  the  notionalamount  of  these  derivative  contracts  was  $2.76  trillion,  of  which  $2.74  trillion  wascomposed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to matchpositions  closely  with  the  objective  of  mitigating  related  currency  and  interest  raterisk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaRWe use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR,which  is  an  estimate  of  potential  loss  for  a  given  period  within  a  stated  statisticalconfidence  interval.  We  use  a  risk  measurement  methodology  to  measure  tradingrelated  VaR daily.  We  have  adopted  standards  for  measuring  trading-related  VaR,and  we  maintain  regulatory  capital  for  market  risk  associated  with  our  tradingactivities  in  conformity  with  currently  applicable  bank  regulatory  market  riskrequirements. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historicalvolatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to aone-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.We calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use tocalculate  VaR,  but  with  model  inputs  calibrated  to  historical  data  from  a  range  ofcontinuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The stressedVaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worstcontinuous  one-year  rolling  period  since  July  2007.  This  stressed  VaR  meets  theregulatory requirement  as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worsethan 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. Foreach  portfolio,  the  stress  period  is  determined  algorithmically  by  seeking  the  oneyear  time  horizon  that  produces  the  largest  ten-business-day  VaR  from  within  theavailable historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008,the  highly  volatile  period  surrounding  the  Eurozone  sovereign  debt  crisis  and  theStandard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the historicaldata set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stressevents will be incorporated.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSStress Testing
We have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an
array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical
scenario  of  adverse  economic  and  financial  conditions.  We  also  monitor
concentrations  of  risk  such  as  concentration  by  branch,  risk  component,  and
currency  pairs.  We  conduct  stress  testing  on  a  daily  basis  based  on  selected
historical  stress  events  that  are  relevant  to  our  positions  in  order  to  estimate  the
potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and
we  also  perform  stress  testing  as  part  of  the  Federal  Reserve's  CCAR  process.
Stress  testing  is  conducted,  analyzed  and  reported  at  the  corporate,  trading  desk,
division  and  risk-factor  level  (for  example,  exchange  risk,  interest  rate  risk  and
volatility risk).
Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by ERMand reported to the TMRC. Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in
conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the
TMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt
review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-Testing
We  perform  frequent  back-testing  to  assess  the  accuracy  of  our  VaR-based
model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the
comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L)
outcomes  observed  from  daily  market  movements.  We  back-test  our  VaR  modelusing “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissionsand NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to theprice  movement  of  the  trading  assets  and  liabilities  themselves,  such  as  fees,commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.We  experienced  no  back-testing  exceptions  in  the  quarter  ended  March  31,2021, no back-testing exceptions in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and fourback-testing exceptions in the quarter ended March 31, 2020. At a 99% confidenceinterval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception everyhundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year). The 2020 back-testingexceptions were all noted during the March 2020 market turmoil where some of thelargest risk factor shifts since the 2007/2008 financial crisis were observed.The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our tradingactivities  for  covered  positions  held  during  the  quarters  ended  March  31,  2021,December  31,  2020  and  March  31,  2020,  respectively,  as  measured  by  our  VaRmethodology.  Diversification  effect  in  the  tables  below  represents  the  differencebetween  total  VaR  and  the  sum  of  the  VaRs  for  each  trading  activity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe three month average of our stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $45 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, compared to an average of approximately$42 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and $40 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. The increase in the average stressed VaR for the quarter ended March 31,2021 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2020, is primarily attributed to higher interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our tradingactivities. Overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations.Both the ten-day VaR-based measures and the stressed VaR-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the closeof business each day over the past one-year period.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval,and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.
The  following  tables  present  the  VaR  and  stressed-VaR  associated  with  our  trading  activities  attributable  to  foreign  exchange  risk,  interest  rate  risk  and  volatility  risk  as  ofMarch 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively. The sum of the VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures for each attribute exceeded the total VaR andthe total stressed VaR as of each period-end. This is primarily due to diversification benefits across attributes.

Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured bythe measures used for interest rate risk.  Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.
Asset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets andliabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economicvalue of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client depositsgenerated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency compositionof our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities.
We quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfoliopositioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate(1)

Table 32, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020. OurMarch 31, 2021 baseline forecast assumes no changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.

Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financialperformance. While investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change, our modeling approach during the relevant periods hasbeen to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rates scenarios. While this approach was used for the March 31, 2021 reporting period,we did deviate in March 2020 experiencing a rapid increase in client deposits at the beginning of the global pandemic. For the +100bp shock scenario in the March 31, 2020 reportingperiod, client deposits were modeled to return to average balance levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents heldwith central banks.
Beginning with the December 31, 2020 reporting period, we enhanced our NII sensitivity methodology so that the full impact of rate shocks are realized for all currencies even ifthe  result  is  negative  interest  rates.  Prior  to  the  December  31,  2020  reporting  period,  our  results  in  lower  rate  scenarios  were  impacted  by  an  assumed  floor  at  zero  for  certaincurrencies including U.S. dollar. For consistency in this disclosure, the March 31, 2020 reporting period is restated in the table below using enhanced modeling for negative rates.TABLE 33: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY

The short-end is 0-3 months. The long-end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.
As of March 31, 2021, NII is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to March 31, 2020, our NII is more sensitive to parallelrate increases primarily due to higher forecasted levels of deposits and hedging activity. Our NII benefit from a parallel decline in rates has decreased due to hedging activity andincreased floating non-US assets.
U.S. dollar NII as of March 31, 2021 is positioned to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to March 31, 2020, our U.S. dollar NII benefitto higher rates has increased primarily due to higher forecasted levels of deposits and hedging activity. Compared to March 31, 2020, our U.S. dollar NII benefit to lower rates hasmodestly declined primarily due to lower hedging activity. We project an NII benefit to a larger upward rate shock of +100bps which assumes deposit rates lag, and we project an NIIbenefit from a larger downward rate shock of -100 bps, which assumes negative interest rates and charging interest on client deposits and the effect of contractual floors on loans andsecurities. NII is also exposed to smaller shocks to short-end U.S. interest rates. If short-end U.S. interest rates increase or (decrease) by 5 bps, we estimate the annualized impact tobe approximately $20 million in higher (or lower) NII primarily due to the impact on our sponsored repo activity.
NII  is  still  positioned  to  benefit  from  changes  in  non-U.S.  interest  rates  with  the  majority  of  our  sensitivity  derived  from  the  short-end  of  the  curve  given  deposit  pricingexpectations. Compared to March 31, 2020, our non-U.S. benefit from higher rates increased and the benefit from lower rates decreased due to higher levels of floating rate EURdenominated assets.

instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. Management compares the
change in EVE sensitivity against our aggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital,
calculated  in  conformity  with  current  applicable  regulatory  requirements.  EVE
sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. Also, the

Model Risk Management
The use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with
large  and  complex  organizations  relying  on  sophisticated  models  to  support
numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models contemporaneously
represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of
risk.  In  large  banking  organizations  like  us,  model  results  influence  business
decisions,  and  model  failure  could  have  a  harmful  effect  on  our  financial
performance. As a result, the Model Risk Management Framework seeks to mitigate
our model risk.
For  additional  information  about  our  model  risk  management  framework,
including our governance and model validation, refer to pages 112 to 113 included
under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and
Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We  define  strategic  risk  as  the  current  or  prospective  impact  on  earnings  orcapital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategicinitiatives,  or  lack  of  responsiveness  to  industry-wide  changes.  Strategic  risks  areinfluenced  by  changes  in  the  competitive  environment;  decline  in  marketperformance  or  changes  in  our  business  activities;  and  the  potential  secondaryimpacts  of  reputational  risks,  not  already  captured  as  market,  interest  rate,  credit,operational,  model  or  liquidity  risks.  We  incorporate  strategic  risk  into  ourassessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes.For additional information about our strategic risk management framework, referto  page  113  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations, "Strategic Risk Management", in our2020 Form 10-K.
Capital
Managing  our  capital  involves  evaluating  whether  our  actual  and  projectedlevels  of  capital  are  commensurate  with  our  risk  profile,  are  in  compliance  with  allapplicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financialflexibility  to  undertake  future  strategic  business  initiatives.  We  assess  capitaladequacy  based  on  relevant  regulatory  capital  requirements,  as  well  as  our  owninternal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated bybanking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge abovethe minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III final rule. Further, like all otherU.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a 2.0% SLR buffer in addition to therequired  minimum  of  3%  under  the  Basel  III  final  rule.  If  we  fail  to  exceed  anyregulatory buffer or surcharge, we will be subject to increased restrictions (dependingupon  the  extent  of  the  shortfall)  regarding  capital  distributions  and  discretionaryexecutive bonus payments.
Not  all  of  our  competitors  have  similarly  been  designated  as  systemicallyimportant nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank orfinancial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subjectto the same capital, liquidity and other regulatory requirements.For additional information about our capital, refer to pages 113 to 121 includedunder  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  andResults of Operations, in our 2020 Form 10-K.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRegulatory Capital
We and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are
subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. Provisions of the Basel III final rule became
effective on January 1, 2014 with full implementation required on January 1, 2019.
We  are  also  subject  to  the  final  market  risk  capital  rule  issued  by  U.S.  banking
regulators effective as of January 2013.
The  Basel  III  final  rule  provides  for  two  frameworks  for  monitoring  capital
adequacy: the “standardized approach" and the “advanced approaches", applicable
to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach
prescribes  standardized  calculations  for  credit  risk  RWA,  including  specified  risk
weights for certain on and off-balance sheet exposures. The advanced approaches
consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of
RWA related to credit risk, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the
calculation of RWA related to operational risk.
As  required  by  the  Dodd-Frank  Act  enacted  in  2010  and  the  Stress  Capital
Buffer  (SCB)  rule  enacted  in  2020,  we  and  State  Street  Bank,  as  advanced
approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor," also referred to as
the  Collins  Amendment,  in  the  assessment  of  our  regulatory  capital  adequacy,
including  the  capital  conservation  buffer  (CCB)  and  the  SCB,  for  the  advanced
approaches  and  standardized  approach,  respectively,  and  a  countercyclical  capital
buffer. In addition, we are subject to a G-SIB surcharge. Our risk-based capital ratios
for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the
advanced approaches and standardized approach.
The SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation
buffer with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and
lowest  projected  CET1  ratio  under  the  CCAR  severely  adverse  scenario  plus
planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage
of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. TheSCB  requirement,  which  became  effective  October  1,  2020,  can  be  no  less  than2.5% of RWA. Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit abanking  organization’s  ability  to  make  capital  distributions  and  discretionary  bonuspayments to executive officers. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set atzero by U.S. banking regulators.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2021, including a CCBof  2.5%  and  an  SCB  of  2.5%  for  the  advanced  approaches  and  standardizedapproach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, and a countercyclical buffer of0%, are 8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1capital  ratio,  and  11.5%  for  the  total  capital  ratio.  Based  on  a  calculation  date  ofDecember 31, 2019, our G-SIB surcharge for 2021 is 1.0%. Based on a calculationdate of December 31, 2020, our G-SIB surcharge could increase to 1.5% effectiveJanuary  1,  2023.  We  are  evaluating  opportunities  to  reduce  our  surcharge,  whichcould result in us remaining at our current G-SIB surcharge of 1%.To maintain the status of the Parent Company as a financial holding company,we  and  our  insured  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are  required,  among  otherrequirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y and Regulation H.The market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate dailymeasures  of  VaR,  which  reflect  general  market  risk  for  certain  of  our  tradingpositions  defined  by  the  rule  as  “covered  positions,”  as  well  as  stressed-VaRmeasures  to  supplement  the  VaR  measures.  The  rule  also  requires  a  publicdisclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market riskassociated  with  our  trading  activities  and  our  related  VaR  and  stressed-VaRmeasures.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  information  required  by  the  rule  isprovided  under  "Market  Risk  Management"  included  in  this  Management'sDiscussion and Analysis.

 Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financialcondition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatoryreview and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
 Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur  CET1  capital  decreased  $0.93  billion  as  of  March  31,  2021  compared  to  December  31,  2020,  primarily  driven  by  common  stock  repurchases,  capital  distributions  fromcommon and preferred dividends and lower capital related to AOCI and intangible assets, partially offset by net income.
Our  Tier  1  capital  decreased  $1.43  billion  as  of  March  31,  2021  compared  to  December  31,  2020,  due  to  lower  CET1  capital,  primarily  due  to  lower  AOCI  and  the  partialredemption of the Series F preferred stock. Total capital decreased under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $0.59 billion and $0.60 billion, respectively,due to the changes in our CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, partially offset by the issuance of Tier 2 qualifying debt.

 Not applicable As of March 31, 2021, total advanced approaches RWA increased $3.35 billion compared to December 31, 2020, mainly due to an episodic increase in credit risk RWA. Theincrease in credit risk RWA was mainly driven by a net increase in overdraft activity, all other, and repo-style transactions RWA, partially offset by a net decrease in FX trading activity.As of March 31, 2021, total standardized approach RWA increased $7.24 billion compared to December 31, 2020, mainly due to higher credit risk RWA. The episodic increase incredit risk RWA was mainly driven by an increase in FX trading and overdraft activity.
The regulatory capital ratios as of March 31, 2021, presented in Table 35: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the advancedapproaches and standardized approach in conformity with the Basel III final rule. The advanced approaches-based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to ourcapital and related matters as of March 31, 2021, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referredto as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K.Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, preciselyrepresent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
Our  advanced  systems  are  subject  to  update  and  periodic  revalidation  in  response  to  changes  in  our  business  activities  and  our  historical  experiences,  forces  and  eventsexperienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuingregulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in amaterial change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. Anoperational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity ofthe loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to theeffects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.
Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us ormarket activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III final rule will changeand may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III final rule onus and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We  are  subject  to  a  minimum  Tier  1  leverage  ratio  and  a  supplementary
leverage  ratio.  The  Tier  1  leverage  ratio  is  based  on  Tier  1  capital  and  adjusted
quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the
SLR  primarily  in  that  the  denominator  of  the  Tier  1  leverage  ratio  is  a  quarterly
average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance
sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must
maintain  a  2%  SLR  buffer  in  order  to  avoid  any  limitations  on  distributions  to
shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not
maintain  this  buffer,  limitations  on  these  distributions  and  discretionary  bonus
payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
In 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and cleanholding  company  requirements  for  U.S.  domiciled  G-SIBs,  such  as  us,  that  isintended  to  improve  the  resiliency  and  resolvability  of  certain  U.S.  bankingorganizations through enhanced prudential standards. Among other things, the TLACfinal rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC andexternal LTD effective January 1, 2019. Specifically, we must hold:Amount equal to:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRegulatory Developments
In April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace
the current 2.0% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB
surcharge. This proposal would also make conforming modifications to our TLAC and
eligible  LTD  requirements  applicable  to  G-SIBs.  At  this  point  in  time,  it  is  unclear
whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed.
In  November  2019,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  federal  banking
agencies  issued  a  final  rule  to  implement  the  Standardized  Approach  for
Counterparty  Credit  Risk  (SA-CCR)  as  a  replacement  of  the  Current  Exposure
Method  for  calculating  exposure-at-default  of  derivatives  exposures.  Mandatory
compliance with the final rule is required by January 1, 2022.
On March 4, 2020, U.S. federal banking agencies issued the SCB final rule that
replaces,  under  the  standardized  approach,  the  capital  conservation  buffer  (2.5%)
with a SCB calculated as the difference between an institution’s starting and lowest
projected  CET1  ratio  under  the  CCAR  severely  adverse  scenario  plus  planned
common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through
seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement, which became
effective October 1, 2020, can be no less than 2.5% of RWA.
The Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an interimfinal rule effective in March 2020 and later finalized on a permanent basis on August
26, 2020, which revised the definition of eligible retained income for all U.S. banking
organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic
limitations  on  capital  distributions,  where  a  banking  organization's  regulatory  ratios
were to decline below the respective minimum requirements, take effect on a more
gradual basis.
Following the launch of the MMLF program, which we participate in, the Federal
Reserve issued an interim final rule on March 19, 2020 (followed by a final rule on
September 29, 2020), allowing Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) to exclude assets
purchased  with  the  MMLF  program  from  their  RWA,  total  leverage  exposure  and
average  total  consolidated  assets.  For  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2021,  we
deducted  $1.3  billion  of  MMLF  program  average  HTM  securities.  No  new  credit
extensions will be made after March 31, 2021, unless the Federal Reserve and the
Department of the Treasury extend the program.
On March 27, 2020, the BCBS announced the deferral of the implementation of
the revisions to the
Basel III framework to January 1, 2023. As of now, the U.S. federal banking agencieshave not formally proposed the implementation of the BCBS revisions.Effective  April  1,  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  federal  bankingagencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes a deduction forqualifying  central  bank  deposits  from  a  custodial  banking  organization’s  totalleverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodialbanking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifyingcentral  banks  and  (ii)  the  total  amount  of  client  funds  on  deposit  at  the  custodialbanking  organization  that  are  linked  to  fiduciary  or  custodial  and  safekeepingaccounts.  For  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2021,  we  deducted  $92.6  billion  ofaverage balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in thecalculation of our SLR, based on this custodial banking deduction.In  addition  to  the  regulatory  relief  granted  to  custodial  banks  under  theEGRRCPA, an SLR interim final rule released on April 1, 2020 allows all BHCs todeduct  their  deposits  at  Federal  Reserve  Banks  and  their  investments  in  U.S.Treasuries from their total leverage exposure on a temporary basis, from the secondquarter  of  2020  through  the  first  quarter  of  2021.  The  temporary  deduction  of  ourinvestment in U.S. Treasuries is incremental to the existing central bank placementdeduction  granted  to  custodian  banks  under  EGRRCPA.  For  the  quarter  endedMarch 31, 2021, we deducted $12.8 billion invested in U.S. Treasuries from our totalleverage exposure.
On May 15, 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies released an interim finalrule  that  also  permits  insured  depository  institution  subsidiaries  of  BHCs  totemporarily  exclude  deposits  at  Federal  Reserve  Banks  and  investments  in  U.S.Treasuries  from  their  total  leverage  exposure,  subject  to  certain  conditions.  StateStreet Bank has elected not to apply such exclusions as of March 31, 2021.On June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results fromthe 2020 DFAST stress test, including our preliminary SCB of 2.5% and on August10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed that our SCB is 2.5% for the period startingon October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. Additionally, included in thisnotification  and  in  light  of  the  considerable  economic  uncertainty  created  by  theCOVID-19 pandemic, all participating CCAR banking organizations were required toresubmit  their  capital  plans  by  November  2,  2020,  based  on  updated  scenariosprovided by the Federal Reserve on September 17, 2020.State Street Corporation | 43
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn line with the decision to administer a new stress test, the Federal Reserve decided to limit the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to make capital distributions in the thirdand fourth quarters of 2020, although banking organizations were permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levels provided such distributions did not exceed an amountdetermined  by  a  formula  based  on  the  banking  organization's  recent  income.  As  a  result,  CCAR  banking  organizations,  including  us,  were  not  permitted  to  return  capital  toshareholders in the form of common share repurchases during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020.
On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule that will require us and State Street Bank to make certain deductions fromregulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments, including eligible LTD under the TLAC rule, issued by the Parent Company and other U.S. and foreign G-SIBs.The final rule will become effective on April 1, 2021.
On December 18, 2020, following the release of a second round of stress  test results  for 2020, the Federal Reserve decided to modify  the applicable restrictions  on capitaldistributions for the first quarter of 2021. Provided that we do not increase the amount of our common stock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020,common stock dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 were limited to the average of our net income for the four preceding quarters plus a number of shares equalto the share issuances in the quarter related to expensed employee compensation. On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended the aforementioned restrictions through thesecond quarter of 2021. As of now, our capital distributions in the third quarter of 2021 and beyond will be governed by our minimum capital requirements inclusive of the SCB that willnot be recalibrated based on the stress test results.
On March 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve confirmed that the temporary change to the SLR, allowing BHCs and insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs to deductdeposits at Federal Reserve Banks and investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverage exposure, would expire on March 31, 2021.

In June 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2019 CCAR submission; and in connection with that capital plan, our Boardapproved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). Werepurchased $500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program.
On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 in responseto  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  suspension  was  consistent  with  limitations  imposed  by  the  Federal  Reserve  beginning  in  the  second  quarter  of  2020.  As  a  result,  we  had  norepurchases  of  our  common  stock  in  the  second,  third  or  fourth  quarters  of  2020.  In  December  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  issued  results  of  2020  resubmission  stress  tests  andauthorized  us  to  continue  to  pay  common  stock  dividends  at  current  levels  and  to  resume  repurchasing  common  shares  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021.  In  January  2021,  our  Boardauthorized a common share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021. We repurchased $475 million of our commonstock in the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $425 million of our common stock through June 30,2021, in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFederal  and  state  banking  regulations  place  certain  restrictions  on  dividends
paid  by  subsidiary  banks  to  the  parent  holding  company.  In  addition,  banking
regulators  have  the  authority  to  prohibit  bank  holding  companies  from  paying
dividends.  For  information  concerning  limitations  on  dividends  from  our  subsidiary
banks,  refer  to  pages  55  and  57  in  "Related  Stockholder  Matters"  included  under
Item  5,  Market  for  Registrant’s  Common  Equity,  Related  Stockholder  Matters  and
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, in our 2020 Form 10-K, and to pages 171 to
173 in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Our
common stock  and preferred  stock dividends, including the declaration,  timing and
amount  thereof,  are  subject  to  consideration  and  approval  by  the  Board  at  the
relevant times.
Stock purchases  may be made using various types of mechanisms,  including
open  market  purchases,  accelerated  share  repurchases  or  transactions  off  market
and  may  be  made  under  Rule  10b5-1  trading  programs.  The  timing  of  stock
purchases,  types  of  transactions  and  number  of  shares  purchased  will  depend  on
several  factors,  including,  market  conditions  and  our  capital  positions,  financial
performance  and  investment  opportunities.  The  common  stock  purchase  programdoes not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
On  behalf  of  clients  enrolled  in  our  securities  lending  program,  we  lend
securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we
indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of
the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized,
the  substantial  volume  of  these  activities  necessitates  detailed  credit-based
underwriting  and  monitoring  processes.  The  aggregate  amount  of  indemnified
securities on loan totaled $436.04 billion and $440.88 billion as of March 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral
in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed.
We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services
as  agent,  and  the  collateral  is  not  recorded  in  our  consolidated  statement  of
condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if
additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to
the  borrower.  We  held,  as  agent,  cash  and  securities  totaling  $457.37  billion  and
$463.27 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of March 31, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively.
The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. Incertain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements,for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We requirethe counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in anamount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role asagent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by usare  not  recorded  in  our  consolidated  statement  of  condition.  Of  the  collateral  of$457.37  billion  and  $463.27  billion,  referenced  above,  $59.31  billion  and  $54.43billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of March 31, 2021 andDecember 31, 2020, respectively. We or our agents held $64.15 billion and $58.09billion  as  collateral  for  indemnified  investments  in  repurchase  agreements  as  ofMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

designed  to  ensure  that  information  related  to  us  and  our  subsidiaries  on  a
consolidated basis required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC's  rules  and  forms,  and  that  such
information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  our
Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  as  appropriate,  to  allow  timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, our

external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business,
we routinely enhance our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by
either upgrading our current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have
been made and may be made to our internal controls and procedures for financial
reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, no
change  occurred  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
