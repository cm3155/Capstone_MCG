30,  2021  (Form  10-Q),  unless  the  context  requires  otherwise,  references  to

Our  operations  are  organized  into  two  lines  of  business,  Investment

Additional information about our lines of business is provided in Line of
Business Information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note
17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.
This  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  part  of  the  Form  10-Q
and updates the Management's Discussion and Analysis in our 2020 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 previously filed
with  the  SEC  (2020  Form  10-K).  You  should  read  the  financial  information
contained  in  this  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  and  elsewhere  in
this  Form  10-Q  in  conjunction  with  the  financial  and  other  information
contained  in  our  2020  Form  10-K.  Certain  previously  reported  amounts
presented  in  this  Form  10-Q  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  currentperiod presentation.
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates
and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materiallyaffect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  equity,  revenue  andexpenses.
The  significant  accounting  policies  that  require  us  to  make  judgments,estimates  and  assumptions  that  are  difficult,  subjective  or  complex  aboutmatters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:• accounting for fair value measurements; • impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;• contingencies; and• allowance for credit losses.
These  significant  accounting  policies  require  the  most  subjective  orcomplex  judgments,  and  underlying  estimates  and  assumptions  could  besubject  to  revision  as  new  information  becomes  available.  For  additionalinformation about these significant accounting policies refer to pages 123 to125, “Significant Accounting Estimates” included under Item 7, Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, inour 2020 Form 10-K and Significant Accounting Estimates  in Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations inthis Form 10-Q. We did not change these significant accounting policies in thefirst six months of 2021.
Certain financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, including in thisManagement's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, orreported  basis,  and  a  non-GAAP  basis.  We  measure  and  compare  certainfinancial  information  on  a  non-GAAP  basis,  including  information  thatmanagement uses in evaluating our business and activities.Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, andnot  as  a  substitute  for  or  superior  to,  financial  information  prepared  inconformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial information presented inthis  Form  10-Q,  including  this  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,  isreconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP-basis measure.We  further  believe  that  our  presentation  of  FTE  NII,  a  non-GAAPmeasure,  which  reports  non-taxable  revenue,  such  as  interest  incomeassociated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a FTE basis, facilitatesan  investor's  understanding  and  analysis  of  our  underlying  financialperformance and trends.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe  following  “Financial  Results  and  Highlights”  section  provides
information  related  to  significant  events,  as  well  as  highlights  of  our
consolidated  financial  results  for  the  second  quarter  of  2021  presented  in
Table 1: Overview of Financial Results. More detailed information about our
consolidated financial results, including the comparison of our financial results
for  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same
periods in 2020, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, "Line
of Business Information" and "Capital" which follows these sections, as well as
in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  in  this  Form  10-Q.  In  this
Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis,  where  we  describe  the  effects  of
changes  in  foreign  currency  translation,  those  effects  are  determined  by
applying applicable weighted average FX rates from the relevant 2020 period
to the relevant 2021 period results.
Financial Results and Highlights
• Second quarter of 2021 financial performance: ◦ EPS  of  $2.07  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  up  11%,  from$1.86 in the same period in 2020. ◦ Total fee revenue was up 6% in the second quarter of 2021,
compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  including  2%  due  to
currency translation. ◦ Servicing fee revenues were up 10% in the second quarter of
2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  including  3%due to currency translation. Management fee revenues were
up 14% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the same
period in 2020, including 2% due to currency translation. ◦ In  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  return  on  equity  of  12.6%increased from 12.1% in the same period in 2020, primarily
due  to  an  increase  in  net  income  available  to  common
shareholders. Pre-tax margin of 30.9% in the second quarter
of  2021  increased  from  27.3%  in  the  same  period  in  2020,
primarily due to an increase in total revenue. ◦ Operating leverage was 1.9% points in the second quarter of
2021, predominantly due to a $53 million gain on the sale of a
majority  share  of  our  Wealth  Management  Services  (WMS)
business.  Operating  leverage  represents  the  difference
between the percentage change in total
revenue  and  the  percentage  change  in  total  expenses,  ineach case relative to the prior year period.• During the second quarter of 2021, our business and financial resultscontinued to reflect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic:◦ Approximately  80%  of  our  employees  globally  continue  towork remotely as of June 30, 2021.◦ We continued to experience high levels of client deposits inthe  second  quarter  of  2021  amidst  the  Federal  Reserve'sexpansionary monetary policy.
Revenue
• Total revenue increased 3% in the second quarter of 2021, comparedto the same period in 2020, including 2% due to currency translation,as the increase in total fee revenue was partially offset by a decline inNII.  Total  fee revenue increased 6% in the second quarter  of 2021,compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by increases inservicing  fees,  management  fees  and  securities  finance  revenue,partially  offset  by  lower  foreign  exchange  trading  services  revenueand software and processing fees. • Servicing fee revenue increased 10% in the second quarter of 2021,compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher averageequity  market  levels,  client  flows,  and  net  new  business,  partiallyoffset  by  normal  pricing  headwinds  and  lower  client  activity  in  thesecond quarter of 2021. Currency translation increased servicing feesby 3% in the second quarter of 2021, relative to the same period in2020. • Management  fee  revenue  increased  14%  in  the  second  quarter  of2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higheraverage  equity  market  levels  and  net  inflows  from  ETFs,  partiallyoffset  by  a  previously  reported  idiosyncratic  institutional  client  assetreallocation in the first quarter of 2021 and higher money market feewaivers.  Currency  translation  increased  management  fees  by 2% inthe second quarter of 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.• Foreign  exchange  trading  services  decreased  12%  in  the  secondquarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily dueto  lower  FX  volatility,  as  compared  to  the  high  levels  of  volatilityexperienced in the second quarter of 2020State Street Corporation | 8
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSduring  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  partially  offset  by  higher  client  FX
volumes. • Securities  finance  revenue  increased  18%  in  the  second  quarter  of
2021, compared to the same period in 2020, reflecting higher agency
lending  and  enhanced  custody  balances,  partially  offset  by  lower
spreads. • Software and processing fees revenue decreased 12% in the second
quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due
to the absence of prior year market-related adjustments. • NII decreased  16% in the second quarter  of 2021, compared  to the
same period in 2020, primarily due to lower investment portfolio yields
and  a  decline  in  average  short-end  market  rates,  partially  offset  by
growth in deposits, the investment portfolio size and loan balances.
Provision for Credit Losses
• The  provision  for  credit  losses  was  a  $15  million  reserve  release  in
the second quarter of 2021, compared to an expense of $52 million in
the  same  period  in  2020,  which  reflects  a  positive  shift  in
management's economic outlook.
Expenses
• Total  expenses  increased  1%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021,
compared to the same period in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact
of  currency  translation,  partially  offset  by  lower  notable  items.
Currency translation increased expenses by 2% in the second quarter
of 2021, relative to the same period in 2020. • The impact of notable items in the second quarter of 2021 includes: ◦ $53 million gain on the sale of a majority share of our WMS
business, recorded in other income; ◦ legal accrual release of approximately $11 million; and
◦ acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  of  approximately  $11
million, primarily related to CRD. • The impact  of notable items  in the second quarter  of 2020 includes
acquisition  and  restructuring  costs  of  approximately  $12  million,
primarily related to CRD.
AUC/A and AUM
• AUC/A  of  $42.60  trillion  increased  27%  as  of  June  30,  2021,
compared  to  June  30,  2020,  primarily  due  to  higher  period-end
market levels, net new business growth and client
flows.  In  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  newly  announced  assetservicing  mandates  totaled  approximately  $1.19  trillion.  Servicingassets  remaining  to  be  installed  in  future  periods  totaledapproximately $1.24 trillion as of June 30, 2021.• AUM of $3.90 trillion increased 28% as of June 30, 2021, comparedto  June  30,  2020,  primarily  due  to  higher  period-end  market  levelsand net inflows from ETFs and cash, partially offset by institutional netoutflows.
Capital • In the second quarter  of 2021, we returned  a total  of approximately$606  million  to  our  shareholders  in  the  form  of  common  stockdividends and share repurchases. • We  declared  common  stock  dividends  of  $0.52  per  share,  totaling$179  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  compared  to  $0.52  pershare, totaling $183 million in the second quarter of 2020.• In  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  acquired  5.0  million  shares  ofcommon stock, under a share repurchase program approved by ourBoard in April 2021, at an average per share cost of $84.71 and anaggregate  cost  of  approximately  $425  million.  We  had  norepurchases of our common stock in the second quarter of 2020.▪ In  July  2021,  we  announced  a  third-quarter  dividend  of  $0.57  pershare on our common stock, representing a 10% increase on a pershare  basis  from  both  the  third  quarter  of  2020  and  the  secondquarter of 2021. ▪ In  July  2021,  our  Board  authorized  share  repurchases  of  up  to$3.0 billion of our common stock through the end of 2022.• Our  CET1  capital  ratio  decreased  to  11.2%  as  of  June  30,  2021,compared to 12.3% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to higherrisk-weighted assets. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 5.2% asof  June  30,  2021  compared  to  6.4%  as  of  December  31,  2020,primarily due to higher client deposit levels. As of both June 30, 2021and December 31, 2020, standardized capital ratios were binding.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis  section  discusses  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  for  thethree and six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in2020,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financialstatements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statementsin this Form 10-Q.

 Certain fees associated with our GLD ETFs have been reclassified from foreign exchange trading services to
management fees to better reflect the nature of those fees. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to
current-period  presentation.  These  fees  were  approximately  $19  million  and  $34  million  in  the  three  and  six
months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.
 The impact of State Street Global Advisors gross money market fund fee waivers on management fee revenue
was approximately $25 million and $40 million in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,
with an additional approximately $21 million and $31 million of gross money market fund fee waivers attributable
to other fee revenue lines in the same periods, respectively.

Fee Revenue
Table  2:  Total  Revenue,  provides  the  breakout  of  fee  revenue  for  the
three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021  and  2020.  Servicing  and
management fees collectively made up approximately 76% and 75% of
the  total  fee  revenue  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,respectively,  compared  to  72%  and  73%  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,respectively.
Servicing Fee RevenueGenerally,  our  servicing  fee  revenues  are  affected  by  several  factorsincluding changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net newbusiness and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a rangeof  services  to  our  clients,  including  core  custody  services,  accounting,reporting  and  administration  and  middle  office  services,  and  the  nature  andmix  of  services  provided  affects  our  servicing  fees.  The  basis  for  fees  willdiffer across regions and clients.
Changes in Market ValuationsOur  servicing  fee  revenue  is  impacted  by  both  our  levels  and  thegeographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in marketvaluations  have  a  corresponding  impact  on  the  level  of  our  AUC/A  andservicing  fee revenues,  though the degree of impact  will vary  depending onasset  types  and  classes  and  geography  of  assets  held  within  our  clients’portfolios.
Over  the  five  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  we  estimate  thatworldwide  market  valuations  impacted  our  servicing  fee  revenues  byapproximately (1)% to 5% annually. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-EndAverages  and  Quarter-End  Equity  Indices  for  selected  indices.  While  thespecific indices presented are indicative of general market trends,  the assettypes and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, andthe  performance  of  associated  relevant  indices  and  of  client  portfolios  cantherefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, ourasset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.Assuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activityand  asset  flows  and  pricing,  we  estimate,  using  relevant  information  as  ofJune  30,  2021  that  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  worldwide  equityvaluations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for whichour servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change inour  total  servicing  fee  revenues,  on  average  and  over  multiple  quarters,  ofapproximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors constantand using relevant information as of June 30, 2021, that changes in worldwidefixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time aretypically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller impact onour servicing fee revenues on average and over time.(1)

Client Activity and Asset Flows
Client activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivativetrades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impactedby a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these clientrelated activities.
Our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Overthe five years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 2%annually. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset typesand classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differfrom those industry classifications presented.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet New Business
Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, net new business, which
includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues
by approximately 2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually. Gross
investment  servicing  mandates  were  $1.19  trillion  in  the  second  quarter  of
2021 and $1.3 trillion per year on average over the past five years. Over the
five  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  gross  annual  investment  servicing
mandates ranged from $750 billion to nearly $2.0 trillion.
New  business  impacting  servicing  fees  can  include:  custody;  product
accounting;  daily  valuation  and  administration;  record-keeping;  cash
management;  and  other  services.  Revenues  associated  with  new  servicing
mandates  may  vary  based  on  the  breadth  of  services  provided,  the  time
required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.
Revenues  associated  with  new  mandates  are  not  reflected  in  our
servicing  fee  revenue  until  the  assets  have  been  installed.  Our  installation
timeline,  in  general,  can  range  from  6  to  36  months,  with  the  average
installation  timeline  being  approximately  9  to  12  months  over  the  2  years
ended  December  31,  2020.  Our  more  complex  installations,  including  new
State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range.
With respect to the current asset mandates that are yet to be installed as of
June 30, 2021, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming 12 to 24
months,  with  the  associated  revenue  benefits  beginning  in  2022,  and
expected to be largely realized in 2023.
Pricing
The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure,
and  our  servicing  fee  revenues  are  also  affected  by  such  pressures  today.
Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate
from  announced  servicing  wins,  as  the  amount  of  revenue  associated  with
AUC/A  can  vary  materially.  On  average,  over  the  five  years  ended
December 31, 2020, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing
clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with
the impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year. Pricing concessions
can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may
benefit  us,  such  as  extending  the  terms  of  our  relationship  with  the  client,
expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency
on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide.
The  timing  of  the  impact  of  additional  revenue  generated  by  anticipated
additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from the
impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time
required to onboard those new
services, the nature of those services and client investment practices. Thesesame  market  pressures  also  impact  the  fees  we  negotiate  when  we  winbusiness from new clients.
In order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds,we  estimate  that  we  need  at  least  $1.5  trillion  of  new  AUC/A  per  year;although, notwithstanding increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subjectto several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity andasset  flows,  the  manner  in  which  we  price  our  services,  the  nature  of  theassets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors describedin Item 1A, "Risk Factors", in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Historically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimatethat approximately 55%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have beenvariable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily averagevaluations  of  AUC/A;  another  15%,  on  average,  of  our  servicing  fees  areimpacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remainingapproximately 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature norimpacted by market fluctuations or values.
The  impact  of  the  above,  client  activity  and  asset  flows,  net  newbusiness  and  pricing,  noted  drivers  of  our  servicing  fee  revenue  will  varydepending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. Thefull impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in thefunds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods inwhich the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.State Street Corporation | 12
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement Fee Revenue
Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we
report  based  on  month-end  valuations.  Management  fees  for  certain
components of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and UCITS, are
affected  by  daily  average  valuations  of  AUM.  Management  fee  revenue  is
more sensitive  to market  valuations than servicing  fee revenue,  as a higher
proportion  of  the  underlying  services  provided,  and  the  associated
management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security
valuations.  Additional  factors,  such  as  the  relative  mix  of  assets  managed,
may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain
management  fees  are  directly  determined  by  the  values  of  AUM  and  the
investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors,
including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for
clients. In addition, in a prolonged low-interest rate environment, such as we
are  currently  experiencing,  we  have  waived  and  may  in  the  future  waive
certain fees for our clients for money market products.
The impact of State Street Global Advisors gross money market fund fee
waivers  on total  management  fee  revenue  was  approximately  $25 million  in
the second quarter  of 2021. As of June 30, 2021, and assuming  short-termspot  interest  rates  and  the  amount  of  money  market  fund  assets  remain
constant, we estimate that the impact of gross money market fee waivers on
our management fees would be in the range of approximately $20 million to
$25  million  in  each  subsequent  quarter  of  2021.  We  believe  that  a  further
decline  in  short-term  interest  rates,  primarily  one-  and  three-month  interest
rates, to zero would not materially impact this estimate. Alternatively, if shortterm interest rates were to rise by approximately 10bps, the impact of gross
money  market  fee  waivers  on  our  management  fees  would  be  largely
mitigated in the subsequent quarterly periods.
Asset-based  management  fees  for  passively  managed  products,  to
which  our  AUM  is  currently  primarily  weighted,  are  generally  charged  at  a
lower  fee  on  AUM  than  for  actively  managed  products.  Actively  managed
products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded
when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with
the applicable account's performance.
In light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of June30,  2021  and  assuming  that  all  other  factors  remain  constant,  including  theimpact of business won and lost and client flows, that:• A  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  worldwide  equity  valuations,  on  aweighted  average  basis,  over  the  relevant  periods  for  which  ourmanagement  fees  are  calculated,  would  result  in  a  correspondingchange in our total management fee revenues, on average and overmultiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and• We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors constant and usingrelevant information as of June 30, 2021, that changes in worldwidefixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and overtime are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, will havea smaller impact on our management fee revenues on average andover time.
Daily  averages,  month-end  averages  and  quarter-end  indicesdemonstrate  worldwide  changes  in  equity  and  debt  markets  that  affect  ourmanagement fee revenue. Quarter-end indices affect the values of AUM as ofthose dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and QuarterEnd Equity Indices for selected indices.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet Interest Income
See  Table  2:  Total  Revenue,  for  the  breakout  of  interest  income  and
interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, compared
to the same periods in 2020.
NII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less
interest  expense  incurred  on  interest-bearing  liabilities.  Interest-earning
assets,  which  principally  consist  of  investment  securities,  interest-bearing
deposits  with  banks,  loans,  resale  agreements  and  other  liquid  assets,  are
financed  primarily  by  client  deposits,  short-term  borrowings  and  long-termdebt.
NIM  represents  the  relationship  between  annualized  FTE  NII  and
average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing
FTE  NII  by  average  interest-earning  assets.  Revenue  that  is  exempt  fromincome  taxes,  mainly  earned  from  certain  investment  securities  (state  and
political subdivisions), is adjusted to a FTE basis using the U.S. federal and
state statutory income tax rates.
NII on a FTE basis decreased in the three and six months ended June
30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  lower
investment  portfolio  yields  and a  decline  in average  short-end  market  rates,
partially  offset  by growth in deposits,  the investment  portfolio  size,  and loan
balances.
Investment  securities  net  premium  amortization,  which  is  included  in
interest income, was $157 million and $326 million in the three and six months
ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $109 million and $217 million
in the same periods in 2020, respectively. The increase is primarily driven by
low interest rates and faster prepayments.
Interest  income  related  to  debt  securities  is  recognized  in  our
consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a
basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life
of the security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs,
as  well  as  purchase  premiums  or  discounts,  resulting  in  amortization  or
accretion,  accordingly.  The  amortization  of  premiums  and  accretion  of
discounts  are  adjusted  for  prepayments  when  they  occur,  which  primarily
impact mortgage-backed securities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSChanges  in  the  components  of  interest-earning  assets  and  interestbearing  liabilities  are  discussed  in  more  detail  below.  Additional  information
about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in
Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements within this Form 10-Q.
Average  total  interest-earning  assets  were $266.02 billion and $260.41
billion  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,
compared to $244.79 billion and $225.71 billion in the same periods in 2020,
respectively. The increase is primarily due to higher interest-bearing deposits
with banks, investment securities and other interest- earning assets, partially
offset  by  a  decrease  in  investment  securities  purchased  under  the  MMLF
facility.
Interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $99.44 billion and $97.35
billion  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,
compared  to  $86.74  billion  and  $76.93  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,
respectively.  These  deposits  primarily  reflect  our  maintenance  of  cash
balances at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other
non-U.S.  central  banks.  The  higher  levels  of  average  cash  balances  with
central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.
Securities  purchased  under  resale  agreements  averaged  $3.96  billion
and  $4.26  billion  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,
respectively, compared to $3.34 billion and $2.57 billion in the same periods in
2020, respectively. The impact of balance sheet netting decreased to $61.59
billion and $74.41  billion in the  three  and six  months  ended June 30,  2021,
respectively,  compared  to  $103.15  billion  and  $113.56  billion  in  the  same
periods in 2020, respectively. We maintain an agreement with Fixed Income
Clearing  Corporation  (FICC),  a  clearing  organization  that  enables  us  to  net
securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under
resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing
organization, when specific netting criteria are met. The decrease in average
balance  sheet  netting  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,
compared to the same periods in 2020, is primarily due to lower FICC repo
volumes  from  an  increased  cash  supply  and  lower  short-term  interest  rates
driven  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  stimulus  measures  and Federal  Reserve
intervention.
We  have  been  a  sponsoring  member  within  FICC  since  2005  and
continue to expand our client base as program eligibility parameters broaden.
We  enter  into  repurchase  and  resale  transactions  in  eligible  securities  with
sponsored  clients  and  with  other  FICC  members  and,  pursuant  to  FICC
Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate
and  net  the  transactions.  We  may  sponsor  clients  to  clear  their  eligiblerepurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of theprompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’respective  obligations.  We  generally  obtain  a  security  interest  from  oursponsored  clients  in  the  high  quality  securities  collateral  that  they  receive,which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.Average investment securities were $111.48 billion and $109.66 billion,including $13 million and $634 million MMLF securities, in the three and sixmonths ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $116.63 billion and$107.09 billion, including $19.04 billion and $10.54 billion MMLF securities, inthe  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively.  Average  investment  securities,excluding  MMLF  HTM  securities,  increased  to  $111.47  billion  and$109.02 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,compared  to  $97.59  billion  and  $96.55  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,respectively,  primarily  driven  by  MBS balances,  U.S.  Treasuries  and foreigngovernment  bonds.  The  growth  reflects  our  deployment  of  higher  structuraldeposit levels that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic.Loans  averaged  $29.47  billion  and  $28.75  billion  in  the  three  and  sixmonths  ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  $27.37  billion  and$27.92 billion in the same periods in 2020, respectively. Average core loans,which exclude overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio,averaged $25.49 billion and $24.65 billion in the three and six months endedJune 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $22.55 billion and $22.36 billion inthe same periods in 2020, respectively.
Average  other  interest-earning  assets,  largely  associated  with  ourenhanced custody business, increased to $20.94 billion and $19.63 billion inthe three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, from $9.83 billionand $10.30 billion in the same periods in 2020, respectively, primarily drivenby an increase in the level of cash collateral posted. Enhanced custody is oursecurities  financing  business  where  we  act  as  principal  with  respect  to  ourcustody  clients  and  generate  securities  finance  revenue.  The  NII  earned  onthese  transactions  is  generally  lower  than  the  interest  earned  on  otheralternative investments.
Aggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $193.52billion and $186.50 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021,respectively, from $158.07 billion and $151.33 billion in the same periods in2020,  respectively.  Average  U.S.  interest-bearing  deposits  increased  as  aresult of the market uncertainty due to theState Street Corporation | 16
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCOVID-19  pandemic,  U.S.  monetary  policy  and  the  level  of  global  interest
rates. We expect deposits to remain elevated within the current environment
of  low  interest  rates  and  continued  expansion  of  the  money  supply  by  the
Federal Reserve, but modestly reduced from second quarter of 2021 levels.
Future  deposit  levels  will  be  influenced  by  the  underlying  asset  servicing
business, client deposit behavior and market conditions, including the general
levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.
Average  other  short-term  borrowings  decreased  to  $0.89  billion  and
$0.83 billion in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,
from $3.07 billion and $3.02 billion in the same periods in 2020, respectively.
Average long-term debt was $13.46 billion and $13.64 billion in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $15.57 billion
and $14.43 billion in the same periods in 2020, respectively. These amounts
reflect  issuances,  redemptions  and  maturities  of  senior  debt  during  the
respective periods.
Average  other  interest-bearing  liabilities  were  $5.68  billion  and  $5.27
billion  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,
compared  to  $3.46  billion  and  $3.45  billion  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,
respectively. Other interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash
collateral  received  from  clients  in  connection  with  our  enhanced  custody
business,  which  is  presented  on  a  net  basis  where  we  have  enforceable
netting agreements.
Several  factors  could  affect  future  levels  of  NII  and  NIM,  including  the
volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions;
balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S.
and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity
standards,  or  interpretations  of  those  standards;  the  yields  earned  on
securities  purchased  compared  to  the  yields  earned  on  securities  sold  or
matured;  and  changes  in  the  type  and  amount  of  credit  or  other  loans  we
extend.
Based  on  market  conditions  and  other  factors,  including  regulatory
standards,  we  continue  to  reinvest  the  majority  of  the  proceeds  from  paydowns  and  maturities  of  investment  securities  in  highly-rated  U.S.  and  nonU.S.  securities,  such  as  federal  agency  MBS,  sovereign  debt  securities  and
U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The pace at which we reinvest and the
types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market
conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation
of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and
the  levels  of  global  interest  rates  to  impact  our  reinvestment  program  and
future levels of NII and NIM.
Other Income
In  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  sold  a  majority  share  of  our  WMSbusiness, which resulted in a gain on sale of $53 million that was recorded inother income.
Provision for Credit LossesThere  was  a  $15  million  reserve  release  for  the  provision  for  creditlosses  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  which  reflects  a  positive  shift  inmanagement's economic outlook. This compares to a $52 million provision forcredit losses in the second quarter of 2020.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCompensation  and  employee  benefits  expenses  increased  2%  in  the
second quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due
to  the  impact  of  currency  translation.  Compensation  and  employee  benefits
expenses increased 3% in the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to
the  same  period  in  2020,  primarily  due  to  currency  translation  and  higher
seasonal expenses, partially offset by lower headcount in high cost locations
and  incentive  compensation.  Currency  translation  increased  compensation
and employee benefits expenses by 2% and 3% in the three and six months
ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020.
Total  headcount  was  flat  as  of  June  30,  2021  compared  to  June  30,
2020,  primarily  driven  by  hiring  in  global  hubs,  offset  by  a  reduction  in  high
cost locations.
Information systems and communications expenses increased 6% in the
second quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due
to  higher  technology  and  infrastructure  investments,  partially  offset  by
transformation initiatives. Information systems and communications expenses
increased 8% in the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same
period  in  2020,  primarily  related  to  higher  software  costs,  technology
infrastructure investments and notable items, partially offset by transformation
initiatives.  Currency  translation  increased  information  systems  and
communications  expenses  by  1%  in  both  the  three  and  six  months  ended
June 30, 2021, relative to the same periods in 2020.
Transaction processing services expenses increased 13% and 9% in the three
and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  the  same
periods in 2020, primarily due to higher sub-custody and market data costs.
Currency  translation  increased  transaction  processing  services  expenses  by
3% and 2% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,
relative to the same periods in 2020.
Occupancy  expenses  decreased  8%  and  4%  in  the  three  and  six  months
ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2020,
primarily  due  to  footprint  optimization.  Currency  translation  increased
occupancy expenses by 5% and 3% in the three and six months ended June
30, 2021, respectively, relative to the same periods in 2020.
Amortization of other intangible assets increased 9% and 4% in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2020, primarily due to the lift-out in the first quarter of 2021 of the depository
bank  and  fund  administrator  activities  of  Fideuram  Bank  Luxembourg,  a
subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo.
Other expenses decreased 18% and 11% in the three and six months endedJune 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020, primarilydriven by lower professional services and securities processing losses.Acquisition CostsWe recorded approximately $11 million and $22 million in the three andsix months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $12 million and$23 million in the same periods in 2020, respectively, related to our acquisitionof  CRD.  As  we  integrate  CRD  into  our  business,  we  expect  to  incur  up  toapproximately $225 million in total of acquisition costs for the period beginningthe last quarter of 2018 through 2021, after which we will no longer distinguishcertain CRD costs as acquisition costs. As of June 30, 2021, we have incurreda total of $186 million of acquisition costs related to CRD.Restructuring and Repositioning ChargesThe following table presents aggregate activity for repositioning chargesfor the periods indicated:

Our effective tax ratewas  18.6%  and  18.1%  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,respectively,  compared  to  13.6%  and  15.8%  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,respectively.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  higher  foreign  tax  credits  inthe second quarter of 2020 and lower benefits from tax credit investments in2021.

are  not  necessarily  comparable  with  those  of  other  companies,  including
companies in the financial services industry.
Investment Servicing, through State  Street  Institutional  Services,  State
Street  Global  Markets,  State  Street  Global  Exchange  and  CRD,  provides
services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment
funds  and  other  investment  pools,  corporate  and  public  retirement  plans,
insurance  companies,  investment  managers,  foundations  and  endowments
worldwide.  Products  include:  custody;  product  accounting;  daily  pricing  and
administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund

Included within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which
we  acquired  in  October  2018.  The  Charles  River  Investment  Management
solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify
the  institutional  investment  process  across  asset  classes,  from  portfolio
management  and  risk  analytics  through  trading  and  post-trade  settlement,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSServicing Fees
Servicing fees, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 10% and 8% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021,respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020, respectively, primarily due to higher average equity market levels, client flows, and net new business, partially offsetby normal pricing headwinds and lower client activity in the second quarter of 2021. Currency translation increased servicing fees by 3% in both the three and six monthsended June 30, 2021. Currency translation decreased servicing fees by 1% in both the same periods in 2020.
Servicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 49% and 48% of total servicing fees in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,compared to approximately 47% and 46% in the same periods in 2020, respectively.

Geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.
Asset servicing mandates newly announced in the second quarter of 2021 totaled approximately $1,187 billion. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in futureperiods totaled approximately  $1,236 billion as of June 30, 2021, which will be reflected  in AUC/A in future  periods after  installation  and will generate servicing  feerevenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized over several quarters as the assets are installed and additional services areadded over that period. With respect to the current asset mandates that are yet to be installed as of June 30, 2021, we expect the conversion will occur over the coming12 to 24 months, with the associated revenue benefits beginning in 2022, and expected to be largely realized in 2023.
New asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatoryapprovals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, butfor which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, whichfrom time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which theclient provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also donot include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time besignificant.
With respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting andmonitoring, custody, depository banking services, FX, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equityadministration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency and wealth management services. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates mayvary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs  a  result  of  a  decision  to  diversify  providers,  one  of  our  large  asset
servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its
ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending
necessary approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider
for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful
to our business. The transition is expected to begin in 2022 but will principally
occur  in  2023.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  the  fee  revenue
associated  with  the  transitioning  assets  represented  approximately  1.5%  of
our total fee revenue. The total revenue and income impact of this transition
will  depend  upon  a  range  of  factors,  including  potential  growth  in  our
continuing  business  with  the  client  and  expense  reductions  associated  with
the transition.
For  additional  information  about  the  impact  of  worldwide  equity  and
fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our
servicing  fee  revenue,  refer  to  "Fee  Revenue"  in  "Consolidated  Results  of
Operations" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Foreign Exchange Trading Services
Foreign  exchange  trading  services  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:
Investment  Servicing  Line  of  Business  Results,  decreased  13%  and 19%  in
the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the
same periods in 2020, primarily due to lower FX volatility, as compared to the
high levels of volatility experienced in the first half of 2020 during the COVID19 pandemic, partially offset by higher client FX volumes. Foreign exchange
trading  services  is  composed  of  revenue  generated  by  FX  trading  and
revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up
66% and 34%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in
both the second quarters of 2021 and 2020.
We  primarily  earn  FX  trading  revenue  by  acting  as  a  principal  marketmaker through both "direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.” • Direct  sales  and  trading:  Represent  FX  transactions  at  negotiated
rates  with  clients  and  investment  managers  that  contact  our  trading
desk  directly.  These  principal  market-making  activities  include
transactions  for  funds  serviced  by  third  party  custodians  or  prime
brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us. • Indirect FX trading: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which
we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to
our FX desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute
indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.Our FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors,  including: thevolume  and  type  of  client  FX  transactions  and  related  spreads;  currencyvolatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate,interest  rate  and  other  market  risks  associated  with  our  FX  activities.  Therelative impact of these factors on our total FX trading revenues often differsfrom  period  to  period.  For  example,  assuming  all  other  factors  remainconstant,  increases  or  decreases  in  volumes  or  bid-offer  spreads  acrossproduct mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, inclient-related FX revenue.
Our  clients  that  utilize  indirect  FX  trading  can,  in  addition  to  executingtheir  FX  transactions  through  dealers  not  affiliated  with  us,  transition  fromindirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our“Street FX” service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, inwhich we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients todefine  their  FX  execution  strategy  and  automate  the  FX  trade  executionprocess, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custodyat another bank.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSecurities Finance
Our securities finance business consists of three components:
(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed
investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which
we refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;
(2) an agency lending program for third-party  investment  managers and
asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and
(3)  security  lending  transactions  which  we  enter  into  as  principal,  which
we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
Securities  finance  revenue  earned  from  our  agency  lending  activities,
which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral
and  the  fees  related  to  non-cash  collateral,  is  principally  a  function  of  the
volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the
underlying collateral and our share of the fee split.
As principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the
lending  client  or  other  market  participants  and  then  lends  such  securities  to
the  subsequent  borrower,  either  our  client  or  a  broker/dealer.  We  act  as
principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly
with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our
role  as  principal,  we  provide  support  to  the  transaction  through  our  credit
rating. While we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by
us  in  our  role  as  principal  from  third  parties,  we  have  the  ability  to  source
securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us
as an eligible borrower.
Securities  finance  revenue,  as  presented  in  Table  10:  Investment  Servicing
Line of Business Results, increased 20% and 14% in the three and six months
ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2020,
driven  by  higher  agency  lending  and  enhanced  custody  balances,  partially
offset by lower spreads.
Market  influences  may  continue  to  affect  client  demand  for  securities
finance,  and  as  a  result  our  revenue  from,  and  the  profitability  of,  our
securities  lending  activities  in  future  periods.  In  addition,  the  constantly
evolving  regulatory  environment,  including  revised  or  proposed  capital  and
liquidity  standards,  interpretations  of  those  standards,  and  our  own  balance
sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which
we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of
our  securities  lending  activity  and  related  revenue  and  profitability  in  future
periods.
Software and Processing FeesSoftware  and  processing  fees  revenue  includes  diverse  types  of  feesand  revenue,  including  fees  from  software  licensing  and  maintenance,  feesfrom  our  structured  products  business  and  other  revenue  including  equityincome from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of otherassets,  market-related  adjustments  and  income  associated  with  certain  taxadvantaged investments.
Software  and  processing  fees  revenue,  presented  in  Table  10:  InvestmentServicing Line of Business Results, decreased 9% in the three months endedJune  30,  2021  and  increased  4%  in  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,compared  to  the  same  periods  in  2020,  respectively,  and  reflectsapproximately  $136  million  and  $223  million  from  CRD  in  the  three  and  sixmonths  ended  June  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  approximately$134  million  and  $225  million  from  CRD  in  the  same  periods  in  2020,respectively. Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD isprimarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and software as servicearrangements,  including  professional  services  such  as  consulting  andimplementation  services,  software  support  and  maintenance.  Approximately50%-70%  of  revenue  associated  with  a  sale  of  software  to  be  installed  onpremises  is  recognized  at  a  point  in  time  when  the  customer  benefits  fromobtaining  access  to  and  use  of  the  software  license,  with  the  percentagevarying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms. Theremainder  of  revenue  for  on-premise  installations  is  recognized  over  thelength of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Uponrenewal  of  an  on-premises  software  contract,  the  same  pattern  of  revenuerecognition  is  followed  with  50%-70%  recognized  upon  renewal  and  thebalance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a Software as aService  (SaaS)  related  arrangement,  where  the  customer  does  not  takepossession  of  the  software,  is  recognized  over  the  term  of  the  contract  asservices  are  provided.  Upon  renewal  of  a  SaaS  arrangement,  revenuecontinues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract.As  a  result  of  these  differences  in  how  portions  of  CRD  revenue  areaccounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarterto  quarter.  CRD  contributed  approximately  $140  million  and  $230  million  intotal revenue in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively,compared to approximately $138 million and $233 million in the same periodsin 2020, respectively, which included in the three and six months ended June30,  2021  approximately  $136  million  and  $223  million  in  software  andprocessing fees, respectively, and $3 million and $6 million in brokerage andother trading services, respectively, within foreign exchange trading services.State Street Corporation | 22
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAmortization of tax advantage investments negatively impacted software and processing fees by approximately $30 million and $56 million in the three and sixmonths ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $20 million and $43 million in the same periods in 2020, respectively.
In  addition,  FX  and  market-related  adjustments,  which  also  includes  certain  fair  value  adjustments,  impacted  software  and  processing  fees  by  approximately($1)  million  and ($5)  million  in the  three  and six  months  ended June  30,  2021,  respectively,  compared  to  $8 million  and ($13)  million  in the  same  periods  in 2020,respectively.
Expenses
Total expenses for Investment Servicing increased 2% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same periods in 2020, primarilyreflecting unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation increased expenses for Investment Servicing by 2% in both the three and six months ended June 30,2021 relative to the same periods in 2020. Seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were $141 million in the six months ended June 30,2021 compared to $125 million in the same period in 2020. Total expenses contributed by CRD were approximately $70 million and $137 million in the three and sixmonths ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to $61 million and $119 million in the same periods in 2020, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSExpenses
Total expenses for Investment Management decreased 2% in the three
months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, primarily
due  to  expense  savings  initiatives,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable  currency
translation. Total expenses for Investment Management increased 1% in the
six  months  ended  June  30,  2021,  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,
primarily due to higher seasonal expenses and currency translation. Seasonal
deferred incentive compensation expense and payroll taxes were $35 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to $26 million in the same
period  in  2020.  Currency  translation  increased  expenses  for  Investment
Management by 2% in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021,
relative to the same periods in 2020.
Additional information about expenses is provided under "Expenses" in
"Consolidated  Results  of  Operations"  included  in  this  Management's
Discussion and Analysis.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The  structure  of  our  consolidated  statement  of  condition  is  primarily
driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment
Management  lines  of  business.  Our  clients'  needs  and  our  operating
objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination.
As  our  clients  execute  their  worldwide  cash  management  and  investment
activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the
majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of interestbearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of
currencies;  non-interest-bearing  demand  deposits;  and  repurchase
agreements,  which generally  serve  as short-term  investment  alternatives  for
our clients.
Deposits  and  other  liabilities  resulting  from  client  initiated  transactions
are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly
longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our
deposits  and  seek  to  maintain  appropriate  short-term  liquidity  of  those
liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets
for our operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in
our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as
interest-bearing  deposits  with  banks  and  securities  purchased  under  resale
agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of
the  client  liabilities  and  our  desire  to  maintain  a  well-diversified  portfolio  of
high-quality assets.

funds, $8,380 million private  equity capital call  finance loans and $821 million  loans to business development
companies as of December 31, 2020.
Includes $1,406 million securities finance loans, $629 million loans to municipalities and $21 million other loans
as  of  June  30,  2021  and  $1,911  million  securities  finance  loans,  $754  million  loans  to  municipalities  and
$54 million other loans as of December 31, 2020.
 As  of  June  30,  2021,  excluding  overdrafts,  floating  rate  loans  totaled  $24,477  million  and  fixed  rate  loans
totaled $2,497 million.
The  increase  in  foreign  loans  as  of  June  30,  2021  compared  to
December  31,  2020  was  primarily  driven  by  the  purchase  of  $1,580  million
collateralized loan obligations in loan form in the second quarter of 2021. In
the second quarter of 2021, in addition to our CLOs in the investment portfolio,
we began purchasing CLOs in loan form.
As  of  June  30,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,  our  leveraged  loans
totaled  approximately  $4.55  billion  and  $4.17  billion,  respectively.  We  sold
$21  million  of  leveraged  loans  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  of  which
$16 million remained unsettled and was held for sale as of June 30, 2021.
In addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2021
and  December  31,  2020  of  $541  million  and  $149  million,  respectively,  to
participate in such syndications. Additional information about these unfunded
commitments is
provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.These leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under ourinternal  risk-rating  framework  (refer  to  Note  4  to  the  consolidated  financialstatements  in  this  Form  10-Q),  are  externally  rated  “BBB,”  “BB”  or  “B,”  withapproximately  88%  and  85%  of  the  loans  rated  “BB”  or  “B”  as  of  June  30,2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our investment strategy involvesgenerally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten bymajor global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis processto  each  potential  investment  and  diversifying  our  exposure  by  counterpartyand  industry  segment.  However,  these  loans  have  significant  exposure  tocredit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.Additional  information  about  all  of  our  loan  segments,  as  well  asunderlying  classes,  is  provided  in  Note  4  to  the  consolidated  financialstatements in this Form 10-Q.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSmanagement's economic outlook. As our view on current and future economic
scenarios change, our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may
be  impacted  through  a  change  to  the  provisions  for  credit  losses,  reflecting
credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as changes in management's
economic outlook as of year-end. The remaining $47 million and $50 million
as  of  June  30,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  was  related  to  other  loans,
commercial  real  estate  loans,  off-balance  sheet  commitments  and  other
financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities held to
maturity.
An  allowance  for  credit  losses  is  recognized  on  HTM  securities  upon
acquisition  of  the  security,  and  on  AFS  securities  when  the  fair  value  and
expected  future  cash  flows  of  the  investment  securities  are  less  than  their
amortized cost basis. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of
economic and security-specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates,
derived  by  management,  which  contemplate  current  market  conditions  and
security-specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse
than  management's  expectations  or  due  to  idiosyncratic  bond  performance,
the credit-related component of impairment, in particular, could increase and
would  be  recorded  in  the  provision  for  credit  losses.  Additional  information
with  respect  to  the  allowance  for  credit  losses,  net  impairment  losses  and
gross  unrealized  losses  is  provided  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements in this Form 10-Q.
Cross-Border Outstandings
Cross-border  outstandings  are  amounts  payable  to  us  by  non-U.S.
counterparties  which  are  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars  or  other  non-local
currency,  as  well  as  non-U.S.  local  currency  claims  not  funded  by  local
currency liabilities. Our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits
with  banks;  loans  and  lease  financing,  including  short-duration  advances;
investment securities; amounts related to FX and interest rate contracts; and
securities  finance.  In  addition  to  credit  risk,  cross-border  outstandings  have
the  risk  that,  as  a  result  of  political  or  economic  conditions  in  a  country,
borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of
principal  and/or  interest  when  due  because  of  the  unavailability  of,  or
restrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.
As  market  and  economic  conditions  change,  the  major  independent
credit rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions
and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant
counterparties  to  us,  or  whose  financial  instruments  serve  as  collateral  on
which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the
future. As a result, we may be
exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.The  cross-border  outstandings  presented  in  Table  27:  Cross-borderoutstandings,  represented  approximately  27%  and  30%  of  our  consolidatedtotal assets as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.TABLE 27: CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGS(In millions)

Risk Management
In the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed toa variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others morespecific  to  our  business  activities.  Our  risk  management  framework  focuseson material risks, which include the following: • credit and counterparty risk; • liquidity risk, funding and management; • operational risk; • information technology risk; • market risk associated with our trading activities;• market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we referto as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily ofinterest rate risk;

State Street Corporation | 30
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS• model risk; • strategic risk; and
• reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
Many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of
these  risks  that  could  affect  our  businesses  and  our  consolidated  financial
statements, are discussed in detail on pages 24 to 52 included under Item 1A,
Risk Factors, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
For additional information about our risk management, including our risk
appetite framework and risk governance committee structure, refer to pages
85  to  89  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Risk Management, in our 2020
Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
We  define  credit  risk  as  the  risk  of  financial  loss  if  a  counterparty,
borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable
or  unwilling  to  repay  borrowings  or  settle  a  transaction  in  accordance  with
underlying  contractual  terms.  We  assume  credit  risk  in  our  traditional  nontrading  lending  activities,  such  as  overdrafts,  loans  and  contingent
commitments,  in  our  investment  securities  portfolio,  where  recourse  to  a
counterparty  exists,  and  in  our  direct  and  indirect  trading  activities,  such  as
securities  purchased  under  a  resale  agreement,  principal  securities  lending
and FX and indemnified agency securities lending. We also assume credit risk
in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in
the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or
private sector institutions and fees receivables.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We  maintain  an  allowance  for  credit  losses  to  support  our  financial
assets  held at amortized  cost.  We also maintain an allowance for unfunded
commitments  and  letters  of  credit  to  support  our  off-balance  sheet  credit
exposure.  The  two  components  together  represent  the  allowance  for  credit
losses.  Review  and  evaluation  of  the  adequacy  of  the  allowance  for  credit
losses  is  ongoing  throughout  the  year,  but  occurs  at  least  quarterly,  and  is
based,  among  other  factors,  on  our  evaluation  of  the  level  of  risk  in  the
portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We
utilize  multiple  economic  scenarios,  consisting  of  a  baseline,  upside  and
downside  scenarios,  to  develop  management's  forecast  of  future  expected
losses.
The economic forecast utilized in the second quarter of 2021 reflects a
positive shift in management's economic outlook. Allowance
estimates  remain  subject  to  continued  model  and economic  uncertainty  andmanagement  may  use  qualitative  adjustments.  If  future  data  and  forecastsdeviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for creditlosses as of June 30, 2021, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower thanforecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowancefor credit losses will also change.
Additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided inNote 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q.For additional information about our credit risk management framework,including  our  core  policies  and  principles,  structure  and  organization,  creditratings, risk parameter estimates, credit risk mitigation, credit limits, reporting,monitoring  and  controls,  refer  to  pages  89  to  94  included  under  Item  7,Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations, Credit Risk Management, in our 2020 Form 10-K.Liquidity Risk Management
Our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on ouractivities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidityrisk  we  employ  limits,  maintain  established  metrics  and  early  warningindicators  and  perform  routine  stress  testing  to  identify  potential  liquidityneeds. This process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal andexternal  scenarios  which assist  us in measuring  our liquidity position  and inidentifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sourcesof cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the globalcapital markets.
We  manage  our  liquidity  on  a  global,  consolidated  basis.  We  alsomanage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company, as well as atcertain  branches  and  subsidiaries  of  State  Street  Bank.  State  Street  Bankgenerally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, suchas the federal funds market and the Federal Reserve's discount window. TheParent Company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflectingnarrower market access. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, orhas direct access to, primarily through SSIF, a direct subsidiary of the ParentCompany, and the support agreement, as discussed in the "Uses of Liquidity"section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis, enough cash to meetits current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over thenext  one-year  period.  Reference  our  SPOE  Strategy  as  discussed  in  the"Uses  of  Liquidity"  section  of  this  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis.Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available atState Street Corporation | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company. As of June 30, 2021,
our  Parent  Company  and  State  Street  Bank  had  no  senior  notes  or
subordinated  debentures  outstanding  that  will  mature  in  the  next  twelve
months.
As  a  systemically  important  financial  institution,  our  liquidity  risk
management  activities  are  subject  to  heightened  and  evolving  regulatory
requirements,  including  interpretations  of  those  requirements,  under  specific
U.S.  and  international  regulations  and  also  resulting  from  published  and
unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution
planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions. Satisfaction of these
requirements  could,  in  some  cases,  result  in  changes  in  the  composition  of
our investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain
business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products
and services. If we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of
our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a
resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or
otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding. Our efforts to satisfy, or our
failure  to  satisfy,  these  regulatory  requirements  could  materially  adversely
affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
For  additional  information  on  our  liquidity  risk  management,  as  well  as
liquidity metrics, refer to pages 94 to 99 included under Item 7, Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations,
Liquidity Risk Management, in our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information
on our liquidity ratios, including LCR and the net stable funding ratio, refer to
page 14 included under Item 1, Business, in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Asset Liquidity
Central  to  the  management  of  our  liquidity  is  asset  liquidity,  which
consists primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify
for  inclusion  in  the  LCR.  As  a  banking  organization,  we  are  subject  to  a
minimum LCR under the LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The
LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active
banking  organizations,  like  us,  to  improve  the  banking  industry's  ability  to
absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and
improve  the  measurement  and  management  of  liquidity  risk.  The  LCR
measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows. HQLA primarily
consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that
qualify  for  inclusion  under  the  LCR  rule.  The  LCR  was  fully  implemented
beginning on January 1, 2017. We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily.
For the
quarters ended June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, daily average LCR forthe Parent Company was 104% and 108%, respectively, with the lower dailyaverage LCR for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 driven primarily by higherdeposits,  the  maturity  of  long-term  debt  and  the  use  of  cash  to  facilitatecommon  share  repurchases.  The  impact  of  higher  deposits  on  the  ParentCompany's LCR is offset by a cap on the HQLA from State Street Bank andTrust that can be recognized at the Parent Company as defined in the U.S.LCR Final Rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of liquidity under stress. Theaverage HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR final rule definition was$169.11 billion and $143.61 billion, post-prescribed haircuts, for the quartersended June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase inaverage HQLA for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to the quarterended  December  31,  2020,  was  primarily  due  to  a  higher  level  of  clientdeposits. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, LCR for State Street Bank andTrust was approximately 131%. State Street Bank and Trust's LCR is higherthan  the  Parent  Company's  LCR,  primarily  due  to  application  of  thetransferability restriction in the LCR Final Rule to the calculation of the ParentCompany's LCR. This restriction limits the HQLA used in the calculation of theParent  Company's  LCR  to  the  amount  of  net  cash  outflows  of  its  principalbanking  subsidiary  (State  Street  Bank  and  Trust).  This  transferabilityrestriction does not apply in the calculation of State Street Bank and Trust'sLCR, and therefore State Street Bank and Trust's LCR reflects the benefit ofall of its HQLA holdings.
We  maintained  average  cash  balances  in  excess  of  regulatoryrequirements  governing  deposits  with  the  Federal  Reserve  of  approximately$96.82  billion  at  the  Federal  Reserve,  the  ECB  and  other  non-U.S.  centralbanks for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and $75.68 billion for the quarterended December 31, 2020. The higher levels of average cash balances withcentral banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.Liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledgedwithout  corresponding  advances  from  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Boston(FRBB), the FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is amember  of  the  FHLB.  This  membership  allows  for  advances  of  liquidity  invarying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-andliability management. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we hadno outstanding borrowings from the FHLB.
Access  to  primary,  intra-day  and  contingent  liquidity  provided  by  theseutilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject tounderlying conditions. As of June 30, 2021 andState Street Corporation | 32
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDecember  31,  2020,  we  had  no  outstanding  primary  credit  borrowings  fromthe FRBB discount window or any other central bank facility.
In  addition  to  the  securities  included  in  our  asset  liquidity,  we  have
significant  amounts  of  other  unencumbered  investment  securities.  These
securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed
as those included in our asset liquidity.
The  average  fair  value  of  total  unencumbered  securities  was  $97.02
billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to $89.12 billion for the
quarter ended December 31, 2020.
Uses of Liquidity
Significant  uses  of  our  liquidity  could  result  from  the  following:
withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of
credit;  advances  to  clients  to  settle  securities  transactions;  increases  in  our
investment  and  loan  portfolios;  or  other  permitted  purposes.  Such
circumstances  would  generally  arise  under  stress  conditions  including
deterioration  in  credit  ratings.  A  recurring  use  of  our  liquidity  involves  our
deployment  of  HQLA  from  our  investment  portfolio  to  post  collateral  to
financial  institutions  serving  as  sources  of  securities  under  our  enhanced
custody program.
We had unfunded commitments  to extend credit with gross contractual
amounts totaling $34.97 billion and $34.21 billion and standby letters of credit
totaling $3.47 billion and $3.33 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral.
As  of  June  30,  2021,  approximately  71%  of  our  unfunded  commitments  to
extend credit and 27% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year.
Since  many  of  our  commitments  are  expected  to  expire  or  renew  without
being  drawn  upon,  the  gross  contractual  amounts  do  not  necessarily
represent our future cash requirements.
Resolution Planning
State  Street,  like  other  bank  holding  companies  with  total  consolidated
assets of $50 billion or more, periodically submits a plan for rapid and orderly
resolution  in  the  event  of  material  financial  distress  or  failure,  commonly
referred to as a resolution plan or a living will, to the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC  under  Section  165(d)  of  the  Dodd-Frank  Act.  Through  resolution
planning,  we  seek,  in  the  event  of  our  insolvency,  to  maintain  State  Street
Bank’s role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while
minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of
our stakeholders. We have and will continue to focus management attention
and  resources  to  meet  regulatory  expectations  with  respect  to  resolution
planning.
The  Federal  Reserve  and  FDIC  jointly  issued  a  final  rule  that  waspublished in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019. This final rule revisedthe  implementation  requirements  under  the  Dodd  Frank  Act's  resolutionplanning provisions by means of establishing a biennial filing cycle for the U.S.G-SIBs,  including  State  Street.  This  cycle  alternates  between  a  targetedresolution plan, followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agenciespublished on June 29, 2020 the scope for the 2021 targeted resolution plan, toinclude the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm levelinformation, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We submittedour 2021 targeted resolution plan to the Agencies on July 1, 2021.In  the  event  of  material  financial  distress  or  failure,  our  preferredresolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. For additional information about theSPOE Strategy, refer to pages 18 to 20 included under Item 1, Business, inour 2020 Form 10-K. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcyof  the  Parent  Company  and  pursuant  to  a  support  agreement  among  theParent  Company,  SSIF,  our  Beneficiary  Entities  (as  defined  below)  andcertain other of our entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available resources, torecapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and our other entitiesbenefiting  from  such  capital  and/or  liquidity  (collectively  with  State  StreetBank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the BeneficiaryEntities  from  themselves  entering  into  resolution  proceedings.  Following  therecapitalization  of,  or  provision  of  liquidity  to  the  Beneficiary  Entities,  theParent  Company  would  enter  into  a  bankruptcy  proceeding  under  the  U.S.Bankruptcy  Code.  The  Beneficiary  Entities  and  our  subsidiaries  would  betransferred  to  a  newly  organized  holding  company  held  by  a  reorganizationtrust for the benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants.Under the support agreement, the Parent Company has pre-funded SSIFby contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits,debt  investments,  investments  in  marketable  securities  and  other  cash  andnon-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF contemporaneous with entering intothe  support  agreement  and  will  continue  to  contribute  such  assets,  to  theextent  available,  on  an  on-going  basis.  In  consideration  for  thesecontributions,  SSIF  has  agreed  in  the  support  agreement  to  provide  capitaland liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entitiesin accordance with the Parent Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Underthe support agreement, the Parent Company is only permitted to retain certainamounts  of  cash  needed  to  meet  its  upcoming  obligations  and  to  fundexpenses  during  a  potential  bankruptcy  proceeding.  SSIF  has  provided  theParent Company with a committed credit line andState Street Corporation | 33
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSissued (and may issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company
(the Parent Company Funding Notes) that together are intended to allow us to
continue to meet our obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence
of a "Recapitalization Event" (as defined below). The support agreement does
not  contemplate  that  SSIF  is  obligated  to  maintain  any  specific  level  of
resources  and  SSIF  may  not  have  sufficient  resources  to  implement  the
SPOE Strategy.
In the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding
under the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or
be  exchanged  for  capital  contributed  to  SSIF.  The  obligations  of  the  Parent
Company  and  SSIF  under  the  support  agreement  are  secured  through  a
security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company
and SSIF would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to
the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent
Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.
In accordance with its policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing
basis,  the  capital  and  liquidity  needs  of  State  Street  Bank  and  the  other
Beneficiary  Entities.  To  support  this  process,  we  have  established  a  trigger
framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions
that  would  need  to  be  made  if  certain  events  tied  to  our  financial  condition
occur. In the event that we experience material financial distress, the support
agreement  requires  us  to  model  and  calculate  certain  capital  and  liquidity
triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not the Parent Company
should commence  preparations  for a bankruptcy  filing and whether or not a
Recapitalization Event has occurred.
Upon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be
authorized  to  provide  any  further  liquidity  to  the  Parent  Company;  (2)  the
Parent  Company  would  be  required  to  contribute  to  SSIF  any  remaining
assets  it  is  required  to  contribute  to  SSIF  under  the  support  agreement;  (3)
SSIF  would  be  required  to  provide  capital  and  liquidity  support  to  the
Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation; and (4) the
Parent  Company  would  be  expected  to  commence  Chapter  11  proceedings
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the
support agreement, should rely, including in evaluating any of our entities froma  creditor's  perspective  or  determining  whether  to  enter  into  a  contractual
relationship with any of our entities, on any of our affiliates being or remaining
a  Beneficiary  Entity  or  receiving  capital  or  liquidity  support  pursuant  to  the
support agreement.
A “Recapitalization Event” is defined under the support agreement as theearlier  occurrence  of  one  or  more  capital  and  liquidity  thresholds  beingbreached or the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors forthe Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. These thresholdsare set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital andliquidity  to  enable  an  orderly  resolution  without  extraordinary  governmentsupport. The SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreementmay result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencementof  bankruptcy  proceedings  by  the  Parent  Company  at  an  earlier  stage  offinancial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place.An  expected  effect  of  the  SPOE  Strategy  and  applicable  TLAC  regulatoryrequirements  is  that  losses  will  be  imposed  on  the  Parent  Companyshareholders  and  the  holders  of  long-term  debt  and  other  forms  of  TLACsecurities  currently  outstanding  or  issued  in  the  future  by  the  ParentCompany, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of itslosses  are  imposed  on  the  holders  of  the  debt  securities  of  the  ParentCompany's  operating  subsidiaries  or  any  of  their  depositors  or  creditors,  orbefore U.S. taxpayers are put at risk.
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  credit  rating  agencies,  in  response  toour 2021 resolution plan or the support agreement, will not downgrade, placeon negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings, generallyor  on  specific  debt  securities.  Any  such  downgrade,  placement  on  negativewatch or change in outlook could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limitour  access  to  the  capital  markets  or  result  in  restrictive  covenants  in  futuredebt  agreements  and  could  also  adversely  impact  the  trading  prices,  or  theliquidity, of our outstanding debt securities.
State Street Bank is also required to submit, periodically in accordancewith  applicable  regulations  and  FDIC  guidance,  a  plan  for  resolution  in  theevent of its failure, referred to as an Insured Depository Institution (IDI) plan.On April 22, 2019, the Federal Register published the FDIC’s advance noticeof proposed rulemaking in which it invited comment on potential revisions toits  IDI  plan  requirements.  In  addition  to  this  advance  notice  of  proposedrulemaking, on April 16, 2019, the FDIC Board voted to delay the next roundof  submissions  under  the  IDI  Rule  until  the  rulemaking  process  has  beencompleted.  On  June  25,  2021,  the  FDIC  issued  a  statement  adjusting  thetiming of IDI plan submissions to a triennial filing for State Street and the otherU.S. G-SIBs.

Deposits
We  provide  products  and  services  including  custody,  accounting,
administration,  daily  pricing,  FX  services,  cash  management,  financial  asset
management,  securities  finance  and  investment  advisory  services.  As  a
provider  of  these  products  and  services,  we  generate  client  deposits,  which
have  generally  provided  a  stable,  low-cost  source  of  funds.  As  a  global
custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of
both  June  30,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,  approximately  65%  of  our
average  total  deposit  balances  were  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars,
approximately 15% in EUR, 10% in the British pound Sterling (GBP) and 10%in all other currencies.
Short-Term Funding
Our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our
liquidity  management  strategy.  These  assets  provide  liquidity  through
maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability
to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through
outright sales. In addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us
the  ability  to  source  incremental  funding  from  wholesale  investors.  As
discussed earlier under “Asset Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in
the  FHLB  allows  for  advances  of  liquidity  with  varying  terms  against  highquality collateral.
Short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or
sold  under  agreements  to  repurchase.  These  transactions  are  short-term  in
nature,  generally  overnight  and  are  collateralized  by  high-quality  investment
securities. These balances were $0.66 billion and $3.41 billion as of June 30,
2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
State  Street  Bank  currently  maintains  a  line  of  credit  with  a  financial
institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.13 billion, as of June 30,
2021,  to  support  its  Canadian  securities  processing  operations.  The  line  of
credit  has  no  stated  termination  date  and  is  cancelable  by  either  party  with
prior notice. As of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there was no
balance outstanding on this line of credit.
Long-Term Funding
We have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current
universal  shelf  registration  statement  to  meet  current  commitments  and
business  needs,  including  accommodating  the  transaction  and  cash
management  needs  of  our  clients.  The  total  amount  remaining  for  issuance
under  the  registration  statement  is  $6.15  billion  as  of  June  30,  2021.  In
addition, State Street Bank also
has current authorization from the Board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecuredsenior debt.
On March 3, 2021, we issued $850 million aggregate principal amount of2.200% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2031.
Agency Credit RatingsOur  ability  to  maintain  consistent  access  to  liquidity  is  fostered  by  themaintenance  of  high  investment  grade  ratings  as  measured  by  the  majorindependent  credit  rating  agencies.  Factors  essential  to  maintaining  highcredit ratings include: • diverse and stable core earnings; • relative market position; • strong risk management; • strong capital ratios; • diverse  liquidity  sources,  including  the  global  capital  markets  andclient deposits; • strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and• preparedness for current or future regulatory developments.High ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:• providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;• increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our abilityto offer products; • serving markets; and• engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.A  downgrade  or  reduction  of  our  credit  ratings  could  have  a  materialadverse  effect  on  our  liquidity  by  restricting  our  ability  to  access  the  capitalmarkets,  which  could  increase  the  related  cost  of  funds.  In  turn,  this  couldcause  the  sudden  and  large-scale  withdrawal  of  unsecured  deposits  by  ourclients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extendcredit  or  trigger  requirements  under  securities  purchase  commitments;  orrequire additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivativecontracts.
A  majority  of  our  derivative  contracts  have  been  entered  into  underbilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateralor  terminate  the  transactions  based  on  changes  in  our  credit  ratings.  Weassess  the  impact  of  these  arrangements  by  determining  the  collateral  thatwould  be  required  assuming  a  downgrade  by  all  rating  agencies.  Theadditional  collateral  or  termination  payments  related  to  our  net  derivativeliabilities  under  these  arrangements  that  could  have  been  called  bycounterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levelsspecified in the agreements is provided in Note 7 to the consolidatedState Street Corporation | 35
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSfinancial  statements  in  this  Form  10-Q.  Other  funding  sources,  such  as
secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there
are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
Operational Risk Management
Operational  risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed
internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
In  light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  continue  to  have  business
continuity arrangements in place across our operating locations, and we, and
a  significant  percentage  of  our  key  service  providers,  are  operating
significantly  or  entirely  in  a  work  from  home  environment.  The  current
operating environment increases operational risk and information technology
risk,  including  cyber-threats.  See  also  “Information  Technology  Risk
Management” below.
For additional information about our operational risk framework, refer to
pages  100  to  103  included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Operational Risk
Management", in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Information Technology Risk Management
We  define  information  technology  risk  as  the  risk  associated  with  the
use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence and adoption of information
technology. Information technology risk includes risks triggered by technology
non-compliance  with  regulatory  obligations,  information  security  and  privacy
incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps,
technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies.
For  additional  information  about  our  information  technology  risk
framework  and  associated  risks,  refer  to  pages  103  to  104  included  under
Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and
Results  of  Operations,  "Information  Technology  Risk  Management"  in  our
2020 Form 10-K, and pages 48 to 49 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in
our 2020 Form 10-K - "Any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized
access to our information technology systems or facilities or disruptions to our
continuous  operations,  including  the  systems,  facilities  or  operations  of  third
parties with which we do business, such as resulting from cyber-attacks, could
result  in  significant  costs,  reputational  damage  and  limits  on  our  ability  to
conduct our business activities".
Market Risk Management
Market risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that
could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general
level of
interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Weare exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading,or asset-and-liability management, activities.
Information about the market risk associated with our trading activities isprovided  below  under  “Trading  Activities.”  Information  about  the  market  riskassociated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interestrate risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”Trading ActivitiesIn the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the levelof  which  is  a  function  of  our  overall  risk  appetite,  business  objectives  andliquidity  needs,  our  clients'  requirements  and  market  volatility  and  ourexecution against those factors.
For  additional  information  about  the  market  risk  associated  with  ourtrading  activities,  refer  to  pages  104  to  105  included  under  Item  7,Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations, "Market Risk Management" in our 2020 Form 10-K.As  part  of  our  trading  activities,  we  assume  positions  in  the  foreignexchange  and  interest  rate  markets  by  buying  and  selling  cash  instrumentsand  entering  into  derivative  instruments,  including  foreign  exchange  forwardcontracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps,interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures. As of June 30, 2021,the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.75 trillion, of which$2.73  trillion  was  composed  of  foreign  exchange  forward,  swap  and  spotcontracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of mitigatingrelated  currency  and  interest  rate  risk.  All  foreign  exchange  contracts  arevalued daily at current market rates.
Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaRWe  use  a  variety  of  risk  measurement  tools  and  methodologies,including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within astated  statistical  confidence  interval.  We  use  a  risk  measurementmethodology  to  measure  trading-related  VaR  daily.  We  have  adoptedstandards  for  measuring  trading-related  VaR,  and  we  maintain  regulatorycapital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity withcurrently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements. Our regulatoryVaR-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market riskfactors  during  a  two-year  observation  period  calibrated  to  a  one-tail,  99%confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period.State Street Corporation | 36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSWe calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we
use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a
range  of  continuous  twelve-month  periods  that  reflect  significant  financial
stress.  The  stressed  VaR  model  is  designed  to  identify  the  second-worst
outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July
2007. This stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during
that  twelve-month  period  of  financial  stress.  For  each  portfolio,  the  stress
period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that
produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical
data.  This historical  data set  includes the financial  crisis  of 2008, the highly
volatile  period  surrounding  the  Eurozone  sovereign  debt  crisis  and  the
Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the
historical  data  set  used  to  determine  the  stress  period  expands  over  time,
future market stress events will be incorporated.
For  additional  information  about  our  VaR  measurement  tools  and
methodologies,  refer  to  pages  107  to  110  included  under  Item  7,
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, "Value-at-Risk and Stressed VaR" in our 2020 Form 10-K.
Stress Testing
We  have  a  corporate-wide  stress  testing  program  in  place  that
incorporates  an  array  of  techniques  to  measure  the  potential  loss  we  could
suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions.
We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk
component,  and  currency  pairs.  We  conduct  stress  testing  on  a  daily  basis
based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in
order  to  estimate  the  potential  impact  to  our  current  portfolio  should  similar
market  conditions  recur,  and  we  also  perform  stress  testing  as  part  of  the
Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and
reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor
level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).Stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis byERM and reported to the TMRC. Limit breaches are addressed by ERM riskmanagers  in  conjunction  with  the  business  units,  escalated  as  appropriate,and  reviewed  by  the  TMRC  if  material.  In  addition,  we  have  establishedseveral  action  triggers  that  prompt  review  by  management  and  theimplementation of a remediation plan.
Validation and Back-TestingWe  perform  frequent  back-testing  to  assess  the  accuracy  of  our  VaRbased  model  in  estimating  loss  at  the  stated  confidence  level.  This  backtesting  involves  the  comparison  of  estimated  VaR  model  outputs  to  daily,actual  profit-and-loss  (P&L)  outcomes  observed  from  daily  marketmovements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which excludesnon-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimatedrevenue from intra-day trading.
Our VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specificto the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such asfees,  commissions,  changes  to  reserves  and  gains  or  losses  from  intra-dayactivity.
We  experienced  no  back-testing  exceptions  in  the  quarters  endedJune  30,  2021,  March  31,  2021  and  June  30,  2020.  At  a  99%  confidenceinterval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exceptionevery hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year).The following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with ourtrading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended June 30,2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, as measured by ourVaR  methodology.  Diversification  effect  in  the  tables  below  represents  thedifference  between  total  VaR  and  the  sum  of  the  VaRs  for  each  tradingactivity.  This  effect  arises  because  the  risks  present  in  our  trading  activitiesare not perfectly correlated.

The decrease in the average stressed VaR for thequarter ended June 30, 2021, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2021, is primarily attributed to lower interest rate risk positions.
The VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk inour trading activities. Overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the periodused for the calculations. Both the ten-day VaR-based measures and the stressed VaR-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-dayperiods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.
We have in the past and may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory reviewand approval, and any future modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.
The following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility riskas of June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The sum of the VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures for each attribute exceeded thetotal  VaR  and  the  total  stressed  VaR  as  of  each  period-end.  This  is  primarily  due  to  diversification  benefits  across  attributes.TABLE 30: TEN-DAY VaR ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIES BY RISK FACTOR

Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by themeasures used for interest rate risk.  Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAsset and Liability Management Activities
The primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of theassets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the levelof NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earnedfrom the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balancesheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities.
We  quantify  NII  sensitivity  using  an  earnings  simulation  model  that  includes  our  expectations  for  new  business  growth,  changes  in  balance  sheet  mix  andinvestment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a widerange of rate shocks.  The baseline view of NII is updated on a regular  basis. Relative to the year  ago period,  the June 30, 2021 baseline forecast  is based on anincreased balance sheet size. Compared to March 31, 2021, the baseline forecast assumes a modest reduction in balance sheet size over the subsequent twelve-monthhorizon. Table 32, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2021 and June30, 2020. Our June 30, 2021 baseline forecast assumes no changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.
TABLE 32: KEY INTEREST RATES FOR BASELINE FORECASTS
June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020Fed Funds Target 10-Year Treasury Fed Funds Target 10-Year TreasurySpot rates 0.25 % 1.47 %0.25 %0.66 %12-month forward rates 0.25 1.83 0.25  0.92 In Table 33: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on theyield curve, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest ratechanges on our financial performance. While investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change,our modeling approach during the relevant periods has been to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rates scenarios.While this approach was used for the June 30, 2021 reporting period, we did deviate in June 2020 experiencing a rapid increase in client deposits at the beginning of theglobal pandemic. For the +100bp shock scenario in the June 30, 2020 reporting period, client deposits were modeled to return to average balance levels experienced inthe fourth quarter of 2019 with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents held with central banks.
Beginning with the December 31, 2020 reporting period, we enhanced our NII sensitivity methodology so that the full impact of rate shocks are realized for allcurrencies even if the result is negative interest rates. Prior to the December 31, 2020 reporting period, our results in lower rate scenarios were impacted by an assumedfloor  at  zero  for  certain  currencies  including  U.S.  dollar.  For  consistency  in  this  disclosure,  the  June  30,  2020  reporting  period  is  restated  in  the  table  below  usingenhanced modeling for negative rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSAs of June 30, 2021, NII and U.S. dollar NII is expected to benefit fromboth parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to June 30,
2020, our NII and U.S. dollar NII is more sensitive to parallel rate increases,
primarily  due  to  higher  forecasted  levels  of  deposits  and  hedging  activity,
partially offset by growth in fixed rate securities.
Compared to June 30, 2020, our NII and U.S. dollar NII benefit to lower
rates has increased primarily due to growth in fixed and contractually floored
securities and loans, partially offset by hedging activity. Our projection of an
NII benefit to a larger upward rate shock of +100bps assumes deposit betas
remain low consistent with the last rising rate cycle. Our projection of an NII
benefit  from  a  larger  downward  rate  shock  of  -100  bps  assumes  negative
interest  rates  and  charging  interest  on  client  deposits  and  the  effect  of
contractual  floors  on  loans  and  securities.  NII  is  also  exposed  to  smaller
shocks to short-end U.S. interest rates. If short-end U.S. market interest rates
increase  or  (decrease)  by  5  bps,  we  estimate  the  annualized  impact  to  be
approximately $20 million in higher (or lower) NII primarily due to the impact
on our sponsored repo activity.
NII is still positioned to benefit  from  changes in non-U.S.  interest  rates
with  the  majority  of  our  sensitivity  derived  from  the  short-end  of  the  curve
given deposit pricing expectations. Compared to June 30, 2020, our non-U.S.
benefit from higher rates increased due to higher non-U.S. deposit balances.
Our  benefit  from  lower  rates  decreased  due  to  lower  levels  of  non-U.S.
securities.
EVE sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the
fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a
long-term horizon. In the following table, we report our EVE sensitivity to 200
bps  instantaneous  rate  shocks,  relative  to  spot  interest  rates.  Management
compares the change in EVE sensitivity against our aggregate Tier 1 and Tier
2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory
requirements.  EVE  sensitivity  is  dependent  on  the  timing  of  interest  and
principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet
and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.

As of June 30, 2021, EVE sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts ininterest rates. Compared to June 30, 2020, the sensitivity to the up 200 shockscenarios increased due to growth in our investment portfolio, partially offsetby our hedging activity.
Both NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitored as marketconditions  change.  For  additional  information  about  our  Asset  and  LiabilityManagement  Activities,  refer  to  "Risk  Management"  in  this  Management'sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Model Risk Management
The  use  of  models  is  widespread  throughout  the  financial  servicesindustry,  with  large  and  complex  organizations  relying  on  sophisticatedmodels to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. Themodels  contemporaneously  represent  both  a  significant  advancement  infinancial management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations likeus, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have aharmful  effect  on  our  financial  performance.  As  a  result,  the  Model  RiskManagement Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.For additional information about our model risk management framework,including  our  governance  and  model  validation,  refer  to  pages  112  to  113included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition and Results of Operations, "Model Risk Management", in our 2020Form 10-K.
Strategic Risk Management
We define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earningsor capital  arising  from  adverse  business  decisions,  improper  implementationof  strategic  initiatives,  or  lack  of  responsiveness  to  industry-wide  changes.Strategic  risks  are  influenced  by  changes  in  the  competitive  environment;decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and thepotential  secondary  impacts  of  reputational  risks,  not  already  captured  asmarket,  interest  rate,  credit,  operational,  model  or  liquidity  risks.  Weincorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and riskand capital management processes.
On  March  5,  2021,  the  Intercontinental  Exchange  BenchmarkAdministration  announced,  in conjunction  with the United Kingdom FinancialConduct  Authority  (FCA),  that  it  would  cease  the  publication  of  GBP,  EUR,Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen LIBOR settings for all tenors, as well asone week and two months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021and would cease the publication of overnight and twelve months U.S. dollarLIBOR settings on June 30, 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOn April 6, 2021, the state of New York adopted Alternative Reference
Rate Committee sponsored legislation that would, among other things, provide
for  the  replacement  of  LIBOR  references  in  hard  to  modify  legacy  financial
contracts governed by New York law with a benchmark rate based on SOFR.
Other states may adopt similar legislation.
U.S.  bank  regulators  have  issued  guidance  strongly  encouraging
banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in
new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.
We  are  continuing  our  efforts  to  work  to  facilitate  an  orderly  transition  fromLIBOR, and other interbank offered rates, to alternative reference rates for us
and our clients in a manner consistent with supervisory expectations.
For  additional  information  about  our  strategic  risk  management
framework  and  associated  risks,  refer  to  page  113  included  under  Item  7,
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, "Strategic Risk Management", in our 2020 Form 10-K, and page
46 included under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our 2020 Form 10-K - "The market
transition away from broad use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
as  an  interest  rate  benchmark  may  impose  additional  costs  on  us  and  may
expose us to increased operational, model and financial risk."
Capital
Managing  our  capital  involves  evaluating  whether  our  actual  and
projected  levels  of  capital  are  commensurate  with  our  risk  profile,  are  in
compliance  with  all  applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  are  sufficient  to
provide  us  with  the  financial  flexibility  to  undertake  future  strategic  business
initiatives.  We  assess  capital  adequacy based  on relevant  regulatory  capital
requirements,  as  well  as  our  own  internal  capital  goals,  targets  and  other
relevant metrics.
Our  designation  as  a  G-SIB  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  as
evaluated  by  banking  regulators,  and  requires  us  to  maintain  an  additional
capital  surcharge  above the minimum  capital  ratios  set  forth  in the Basel III
final rule. Further, like all other U.S. G-SIBs, we are also currently subject to a
2.0% SLR buffer in addition to the required minimum of 3% under the Basel III
final rule. If we fail to exceed any regulatory  buffer  or surcharge,  we will be
subject to increased restrictions  (depending upon the extent of the shortfall)
regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments.
Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically
important  nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a
bank  or  financial  holding  company,  and  therefore  some  of  our  competitors
may  not  be  subject  to  the  same  capital,  liquidity  and  other  regulatory
requirements.
For  additional  information  about  our  capital,  refer  to  pages  113  to  121included  under  Item  7,  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  FinancialCondition and Results of Operations, in our 2020 Form 10-K.Regulatory Capital
We  and  State  Street  Bank,  as  advanced  approaches  bankingorganizations,  are subject to the U.S.  Basel III  framework.  Provisions  of theBasel  III  final  rule  became  effective  on  January  1,  2014  with  fullimplementation required on January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the finalmarket  risk  capital  rule  issued  by  U.S.  banking  regulators  effective  as  ofJanuary 2013.
The Basel III final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capitaladequacy:  the  “standardized  approach"  and  the  “advanced  approaches",applicable  to  advanced  approaches  banking  organizations,  like  us.  Thestandardized  approach  prescribes  standardized  calculations  for  credit  riskRWA,  including  specified  risk  weights  for  certain  on  and  off-balance  sheetexposures.  The  advanced  approaches  consist  of  the  Advanced  InternalRatings-Based Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk,and  the  Advanced  Measurement  Approach  used  for  the  calculation  of  RWArelated to operational risk.
As  required  by  the  Dodd-Frank  Act  enacted  in  2010  and  the  StressCapital  Buffer  (SCB)  rule  enacted  in  2020,  we  and  State  Street  Bank,  asadvanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a "capital floor,"also  referred  to  as  the  Collins  Amendment,  in  the  assessment  of  ourregulatory  capital  adequacy,  including  the  capital  conservation  buffer  (CCB)and  the  SCB,  for  the  advanced  approaches  and  standardized  approach,respectively, and a countercyclical capital buffer. In addition, we are subject toa  G-SIB  surcharge.  Our  risk-based  capital  ratios  for  regulatory  assessmentpurposes  are  the  lower  of  each  ratio  calculated  under  the  advancedapproaches and standardized approach.
The  SCB  replaced,  under  the  standardized  approach,  the  capitalconservation  buffer  with  a  buffer  calculated  as  the  difference  between  theinstitution’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severelyadverse  scenario  plus  planned  common  stock  dividend  payments  (as  apercentage  of  RWA)  from  the  fourth  through  seventh  quarter  of  the  CCARplanning horizon.  The  SCB requirement,  which  became  effective  October  1,2020,  can  be  no  less  than  2.5%  of  RWA.  Breaching  the  SCB  or  otherregulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to makecapital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.State Street Corporation | 41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe  countercyclical  capital  buffer  is  currently  set  at  zero  by  U.S.  banking
regulators.
Our minimum risk-based capital ratios as of January 1, 2021, include a
CCB  of  2.5%  and  a  SCB  of  2.5%  for  the  advanced  approaches  and
standardized  approach,  respectively,  a  G-SIB  surcharge  of  1.0%,  and  a
countercyclical  buffer  of  0.0%.  This  results  in  minimum  risk-based  ratios  of
8.0% for the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, 9.5% for the tier 1
capital ratio, and 11.5% for the total capital ratio.
Based  on  a  calculation  date  of  December  31,  2019,  our  current  G-SIB
surcharge, through December 31, 2022, is 1.0%. Based on a calculation date
of December 31, 2020, our G-SIB surcharge beginning January 1, 2023 could
have  been  1.5%.  However,  in  May  2021,  the  Federal  Reserve  granted  our
request  for  relief  relating  to  the  effects  of  the  MMLF  program  on  the
calculation  of  our  G-SIB  surcharge.  As  a  result  of  this  relief,  our  G-SIB
surcharge for 2023 will be 1.0%.
To  maintain  the  status  of  the  Parent  Company  as  a  financial  holding
company, we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required,
among other requirements, to be "well capitalized" as defined by Regulation Y
and Regulation H.
The  market  risk  capital  rule  requires  us  to  use  internal  models  to
calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain
of our trading positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as
stressed-VaR  measures  to  supplement  the  VaR  measures.  The  rule  also
requires  a  public  disclosure  composed  of  qualitative  and  quantitative
information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our
related  VaR  and  stressed-VaR  measures.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative
information required by the rule is provided under "Market Risk Management"
included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related
regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated.
We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated
under  the  standardized  approach  and  those  calculated  under  the  advanced
approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank
regulatory standards.

 Under the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results ofoperations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, ifapplicable,  model  revalidation  and  regulatory  review  and related  supervisory  processes.  An  individual  loss  event  can  have  a  significant  effect  on the  output  of  our  operational  RWA  under  the  advanced  approaches  depending on  the  severity  of  the  loss  event  and  itscategorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.
 Minimum requirements include a CCB of 2.5% and a SCB of 2.5% for the advanced approaches and the standardized approach, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur CET1 capital decreased $0.69 billion as of June 30, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by common stock repurchases, lower capitalrelated to AOCI and capital distributions from common and preferred dividends, partially offset by net income.
Our Tier 1 capital decreased $1.18 billion as of June 30, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower CET1 capital and the partial redemption ofthe Series F preferred stock. Total capital decreased under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $0.55 billion and $0.58 billion, respectively,due to the changes in our CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, partially offset by the issuance of Tier 2 qualifying debt.

 Not applicable As of June 30, 2021, total advanced approaches RWA increased $6.75 billion compared to December 31, 2020, mainly due to an increase in credit risk RWA. Theincrease in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by a net increase in all other, and loans RWA.
As  of  June  30,  2021,  total  standardized  approach  RWA  increased  $4.84  billion  compared  to  December  31,  2020,  mainly  due  to  higher  credit  risk  RWA.  Theincrease in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by an increase in FX trading and loans RWA, partially offset by repo-style transactions RWA.
The regulatory capital ratios as of June 30, 2021, presented in Table 35: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated underthe  advanced  approaches  and  standardized  approach  in  conformity  with  the  Basel  III  final  rule.  The  advanced  approaches-based  ratios  reflect  calculations  anddeterminations with respect to our capital and related matters as of June 30, 2021, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historicalcorrelations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in aquarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and ourregulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results forwhich they are designed or intended.
Our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces andevents experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are alsosubject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experiencea related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA andour capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational riskunder  the  advanced  approaches,  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  loss  event,  its  characterization  among  the  seven  Basel-defined  UOM,  and  the  stability  of  thedistributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.Due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation,specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with theBasel III final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period toperiod. The full effects of the Basel III final rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action orrule-making.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios
We are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a supplementary
leverage  ratio.  The  Tier  1  leverage  ratio  is  based  on  Tier  1  capital  and
adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio
differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage
ratio  is  a  quarterly  average  of  on-balance  sheet  assets,  while  the  SLR
additionally  includes  off-balance  sheet  exposures.  We  must  maintain  a
minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.
We are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we
must  maintain  a  2%  SLR  buffer  in  order  to  avoid  any  limitations  on
distributions  to  shareholders  and  discretionary  bonus  payments  to  certain
executives. If we do not maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions
and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon
the extent of the shortfall.

to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well-capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
In 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD andclean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us,that  is  intended  to  improve  the  resiliency  and  resolvability  of  certain  U.S.banking  organizations  through  enhanced  prudential  standards.  Among  otherthings, the TLAC final rule requires us to comply with minimum requirementsfor external TLAC and external LTD effective January 1, 2019. Specifically, wemust hold:
Amount equal to:
Combined eligible tier 1
regulatory capital and LTDGreater of: • 21.5%  of  total  RWA  (18.0%  minimum  plus  2.5%plus  a  G-SIB  surcharge  calculated  for  thesepurposes  under  Method  1  of  1.0%  plus  anyapplicable  counter-  cyclical  buffer,  which  iscurrently 0%); and• 9.5%  of  total  leverage  exposure  (7.5%  minimumplus  the  SLR  buffer  of  2.0%),  as  defined  by  theSLR final rule.

As  of  April  1,  2020,  the  TLAC  and  LTD  requirements  calibrated  to  theSLR  denominator  reflect  the  deduction  of  certain  central  bank  balances  asprescribed by the regulatory relief implemented under the EGRRCPA.The following table presents external LTD and external TLAC as of June30, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSthis point in time, it is unclear whether this proposal will be implemented as
proposed.
In November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking
agencies  issued  a  final  rule  to  implement  the  Standardized  Approach  for
Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) as a replacement of the Current Exposure
Method  for  calculating  exposure-at-default  of  derivatives  exposures.
Mandatory compliance with the final rule is required by January 1, 2022.
On  March  4,  2020,  the  U.S.  federal  banking  agencies  issued  the  SCB
final  rule  that  replaces,  under  the  standardized  approach,  the  capital
conservation buffer (2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between
an  institution’s  starting  and  lowest  projected  CET1  ratio  under  the  CCAR
severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as
a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR
planning horizon.  The  SCB requirement,  which  became  effective  October  1,
2020, can be no less than 2.5% of RWA.
The Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an
interim  final rule effective  in March  2020 and later  finalized  on a permanent
basis  on  August  26,  2020,  which  revised  the  definition  of  eligible  retained
income  for  all  U.S.  banking  organizations.  The  revised  definition  of  eligible
retained  income  makes  any  automatic  limitations  on  capital  distributions,
where  a  banking  organization's  regulatory  ratios  were  to  decline  below  the
respective minimum requirements, take effect on a more gradual basis.
Following the launch of the MMLF program, which we participated in, the
Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule on March 19, 2020 (followed by a
final rule on September 29, 2020), allowing Bank Holding Companies (BHCs)
to  exclude  assets  purchased  with  the  MMLF  program  from  their  RWA,  total
leverage  exposure  and  average  total  consolidated  assets.  No  new  credit
extensions were made after March 31, 2021, as the program had expired.
On  March  27,  2020,  the  BCBS  announced  the  deferral  of  the
implementation of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023.
As of now, the U.S. federal banking agencies have not formally proposed the
implementation of the BCBS revisions.
Effective  April  1,  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  federal
banking agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes a
deduction  for  qualifying  central  bank  deposits  from  a  custodial  banking
organization’s total leverage
exposure  equal  to  the  lesser  of  (i)  the  total  amount  of  funds  the  custodialbanking  organization  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have  on  deposit  atqualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit atthe custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial andsafekeeping  accounts.  For  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2021,  we  deducted$97.5  billion  of  average  balances  held  on  deposit  at  central  banks  from  thedenominator  used  in  the  calculation  of  our  SLR,  based  on  this  custodialbanking deduction.
On  October  20,  2020,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  other  U.S.  federalbanking agencies issued a final rule that will require us and State Street Bankto make certain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certainunsecured  debt  instruments,  including  eligible  LTD  under  the  TLAC  rule,issued by the Parent Company and other U.S. and foreign G-SIBs. The finalrule became effective on April 1, 2021.
In  light  of  considerable  economic  uncertainty  created  by  the  COVID-19pandemic,  all  participating  CCAR  banking  organizations  were  required  toresubmit  their  capital  plans  by  November  2,  2020,  based  on  updatedscenarios provided by the Federal Reserve on September 17, 2020.In  light  of  the  decision  to  administer  a  new  stress  test,  the  FederalReserve limited the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to make capitaldistributions  in  the  third  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020,  although  bankingorganizations  were  permitted  to  pay  common  stock  dividends  at  previouslevels provided such distributions did not exceed an amount determined by aformula  based  on  the  banking  organization's  recent  income.  As  a  result,CCAR banking organizations, including us, were not permitted to return capitalto  shareholders  in  the  form  of  common  share  repurchases  during  the  thirdquarter and fourth quarter of 2020.
On  December  18,  2020,  following  the  release  of  a  second  round  ofstress test results for 2020, the Federal Reserve modified the restrictions oncapital distributions for the first quarter of 2021. Common stock dividends andshare repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 were limited to the average ofour net income for the four preceding quarters plus a number of shares equalto  the  share  issuances  in  the  quarter  related  to  expensed  employeecompensation, provided that we did not increase the amount of our commonstock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020.On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve extended these restrictions throughthe second quarter of 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOn June 24, 2021, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2021 supervisory stress test. Our preliminary SCB calculated under this year'ssupervisory stress test was well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in an SCB at that floor, which will go into effect starting October 1, 2021 and run through September30, 2022. The Federal Reserve also lifted the restrictions on capital distributions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we are currently governed inour capital distributions by minimum capital requirements inclusive of SCB.

In June 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2019 CCAR submission; and in connection with that capitalplan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30,2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased $500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program.
On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020.As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2020. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarterof 2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31,2021. We repurchased $475 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for thepurchase of up to $425 million of our common stock through June 30, 2021, in compliance with the limit set by the Federal Reserve. We repurchased $425 million of ourcommon stock in the second quarter of 2021. In July 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $3.0 billion of our common stockthrough the end of 2022.

On  behalf  of  clients  enrolled  in  our  securities  lending  program,  we  lend  securities  to  banks,  broker/dealers  and  other  institutions.  In  most  circumstances,  weindemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized,the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities onloan totaled $421.86 billion and $440.88 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount inexcess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and thecollateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. We revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral isnecessary  or  if  excess  collateral  is  required  to  be  returned  to  the  borrower.

The cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, forwhich we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in anamount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by usare not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.
