This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (2019 Form 10-K). 

When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries 
(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the Glossary of Acronyms for definitions of terms used

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified, community-based 
financial services company with $1.92 trillion in assets. Founded 
in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, 
investment and mortgage products and services, as well as 
consumer and commercial finance, through 7,200 locations, more 
than 13,000 ATMs, digital (online, mobile and social), and contact 
centers (phone, email and correspondence), and we have offices 
in 31 countries and territories to support customers who conduct 
business in the global economy. We serve one in three households 
in the United States and ranked No. 30 on Fortune’s 2020 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at September 30, 2020. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements to build the right foundation for all that lies ahead. 
To do that, the Company is committing the resources necessary 
to ensure that we operate with the strongest business practices 
and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an 
appropriate culture in place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 

As required under the amendment to the consent order, certain 
fees and other economic benefits received by the Company from 
loans made in connection with these programs shall be 
transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-profit organizations 
approved by the FRB that support small businesses. After 
removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also 
be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the 
enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of 
$1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding the 
Company’s compliance risk management program and past 
practices involving certain automobile collateral protection 
insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock 
extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance 
risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s 
internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial 
law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required 
by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-objection 
plans to remediate customers affected by the automobile 
collateral protection insurance and mortgage interest rate lock 
matters, as well as a plan for the management of remediation 
activities conducted by the Company. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation.

matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors”

Overview (continued) 

section in our 2019 Form 10-K and Note 14 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. We 
are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We have 
previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our rebuilding 
trust efforts and are in the process of providing remediation for 
those matters. We have accrued for the reasonably estimable 
remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust efforts, which 
amounts may change based on additional facts and information, 
as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our 
regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For additional information, including related legal 
and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K and Note 14 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Recent Developments 

Efficiency Initiatives 
We are pursuing various initiatives to reduce expenses and create 
a more efficient and streamlined organization. Actions from these 
initiatives may include reorganizing and simplifying business 
processes and structures, reducing headcount, optimizing third-
party spending, and rationalizing our branch and administrative 
locations, which may include consolidations and closures. We have 
established dedicated teams in each of our lines of businesses and 
functions to focus on an organized and structured approach for 
implementing these initiatives. The evaluation of potential 
actions will continue in future periods. In third quarter 2020, we 
recognized $718 million of restructuring charges, predominantly 
severance costs, within noninterest expense in our consolidated 
statement of income as a result of these initiatives. For additional 
information, see Note 2 (Restructuring Charges) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working 
diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry 
out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of critical and essential 
services to the public. We have taken comprehensive steps to 
help customers, employees and communities. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing 
forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans 
guaranteed under a new program called the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). The intent of the PPP is to provide loans to small 
businesses in order to keep their employees on the payroll and 
make certain other eligible payments. Loans granted under the 
PPP are guaranteed by the SBA and are fully forgivable if used for 
qualifying expenses such as payroll, mortgage interest, rent and 
utilities. If the loans are not forgiven, they must be repaid over a 

4 

term not to exceed five years. Under the PPP, through 
September 30, 2020, we funded $10.5 billion in loans to more 
than 190,000 borrowers and deferred $417 million of SBA 
processing fees that will be recognized as interest income over 
the term of the loans. As of September 30, 2020, $10.2 billion of 
principal remained outstanding on these PPP loans. We have 
committed to donating the gross processing fees received from 
funding PPP loans to non-profit organizations that support small 
businesses as the fees are recognized in earnings. Through 
September 30, 2020, we donated $51 million of processing fees. 

SBA SIX-MONTH PAYMENT ASSISTANCE  Under the CARES Act, the 
SBA will make principal and interest payments on behalf of 
certain borrowers for six months. During the first nine months of 
2020, over 20,000 of our lending customers were eligible for SBA 
payment assistance, and we received $393 million in payments 
from the SBA. 

LIBOR Transition 
Due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability 
of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), central banks and 
global regulators have called for financial market participants to 
prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR by the end of 2021. 
LIBOR is a widely-referenced benchmark rate, which is published 
in five currencies and a range of tenors, and seeks to estimate the 
cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other 
banks. We have a significant number of assets and liabilities 
referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs), 
such as commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, 
derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt. 

Accordingly, we established a LIBOR Transition Office (LTO) 
in February 2018, with senior management and Board oversight. 
The LTO is responsible for developing a coordinated strategy to 
transition the IBOR-linked contracts and processes across 
Wells Fargo to alternative reference rates and serves as the 
primary conduit between Wells Fargo and relevant industry 
groups, such as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee 
(ARRC). 

In addition, the Company is actively working with regulators, 

industry working groups (such as the ARRC) and trade 
associations that are developing guidance to facilitate an orderly 
transition away from the use of LIBOR. We are closely monitoring 
and seeking to follow the recommendations and guidance 
announced by such organizations, including those announced by 
the ARRC and the Bank of England’s Working Group on Sterling 
Risk-Free Reference Rates. We continue to assess the risks and 
related impacts associated with a transition away from IBORs. 
See the “Risk Factors” section in the 2019 Form 10-K for 
additional information regarding the potential impact of a 
benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or other referenced financial 
metric being significantly changed, replaced, or discontinued. 
On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards 

Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 
2020-04 – Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on 
Financial Reporting (Update) that provides temporary relief from 
existing GAAP accounting requirements for entities that perform 
activities related to reference rate reform. The relief provided by 
the Update is primarily related to contract modifications and 
hedge accounting relationships that are impacted by the 
Company’s reference rate reform activities. For additional 
information on the Update, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

For additional information on the amount of our IBOR-linked 

assets and liabilities, as well as the program structure and 
initiatives created by the LTO, see the “Risk Management –

Reserve System (FRB) announced that it was extending through 
fourth quarter 2020 measures it announced on June 25, 2020, 
prohibiting large bank holding companies (BHCs) subject to the 

FRB’s capital plan rule, including Wells Fargo, from making capital 
distributions, subject to certain limited exceptions. For additional 
information about capital planning, including the FRB’s recent 
prohibition on capital distributions, see the “Capital Management 
– Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section in this Report.

Wells Fargo had net income of $2.0 billion in third quarter 2020 
with diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $0.42, 
compared with net income of $4.6 billion and diluted EPS of 
$0.92 a year ago. Financial performance for third quarter 2020 
was impacted by $961 million of customer remediation accruals 
and $718 million of restructuring charges included in noninterest 
expense. Also, in third quarter 2020 compared with the same 
period a year ago: 
• 

total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income 
and lower noninterest income driven by lower other 
noninterest income, partially offset by higher mortgage 
banking noninterest income; 
noninterest expense increased due to higher restructuring 
charges, partially offset by lower operating losses; 
average loans decreased due to lower commercial and 
consumer loans; and 
average deposits increased on growth in interest-bearing and 
noninterest-bearing deposits.

Wells Fargo had net income of $309 million in the first nine 

months of 2020 with diluted loss per common share of $0.23, 
compared with net income of $16.7 billion and diluted EPS of 
$3.43 a year ago. Financial performance for the first nine months 
of 2020 was impacted by $14.3 billion of provision for credit 
losses, $1.9 billion of customer remediation accruals and 
$718 million of restructuring charges included in noninterest 
expense. Also, in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the 
same period a year ago: 
• 

total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income 
and lower noninterest income driven by lower other 
noninterest income and net gains (losses) from equity 
securities; 
noninterest expense increased due to higher restructuring 
charges, operating losses, and occupancy expense, partially 
offset by lower personnel and advertising and promotion 
expense; 

• 

• 

• 

average loans increased due to higher commercial loans, 
partially offset by lower consumer loans; and 
average deposits increased on growth in interest-bearing and 
noninterest-bearing deposits. 

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a solid capital position in the first nine months of 
2020, with total equity of $182.0 billion at September 30, 2020, 
compared with $188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Our liquidity 
and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at September 30, 
2020, and included: 
• 

our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 134% at 
September 30, 2020, which continued to exceed the 
regulatory minimum of 100%; 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.38% at 
September 30, 2020, which continued to exceed both the 
regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 
10%; and 
our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.76% as of 
September 30, 2020, compared with the regulatory 
minimum of 22.0%.

Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $356 million, 
or 29 basis points (annualized) of average commercial loans, 
in third quarter 2020, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$139 million, or 11 basis points (annualized), a year ago, 
predominantly driven by increased losses in our commercial 
and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $327 million, 
or 30 basis points (annualized) of average consumer loans, in 
third quarter 2020, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$506 million, or 46 basis points (annualized), a year ago, 
predominantly driven by lower losses in our credit card, 
automobile and other revolving credit and installment loan 
portfolios, partially offset by lower recoveries in our 
residential real estate portfolios. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $8.2 billion at 

September 30, 2020, increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, from 
December 31, 2019, predominantly driven by increases in 
commercial and industrial and commercial real estate 
mortgage nonaccrual loans. NPAs represented 0.89% of total 
loans at September 30, 2020. 

Overview (continued) 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality was affected by the economic impact that the 
COVID-19 pandemic had on our customer base. 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$20.5 billion at September 30, 2020, increased $10.0 billion 
from December 31, 2019. We had a $11.3 billion increase in 
the ACL for loans in the first nine months of 2020, partially 
offset by a $1.3 billion decrease as a result of our adoption on 
January 1, 2020, of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – 
Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on 
Financial Instruments (CECL). Our provision for credit losses 
for loans was $14.1 billion in the first nine months of 2020, 
up from $2.0 billion in the same period a year ago. The 
increase in the ACL for loans and the provision for credit 
losses reflected current and forecasted economic conditions 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 2.22% at 
September 30, 2020, compared with 1.09% at December 31, 
2019. 

• 

•  Net loan charge-offs were $683 million, or 0.29% 

(annualized) of average loans, in third quarter 2020, 
compared with $645 million a year ago (0.27%)(annualized).

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for third quarter 2020 was $2.0 billion 
($0.42 diluted earnings per common share), compared with 
$4.6 billion ($0.92 diluted per share) in the same period a year 
ago. Net income decreased in third quarter 2020, compared with 
the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a $2.3 billion 
decrease in net interest income and an $891 million decrease in 
noninterest income, partially offset by a $659 million decrease in 
income tax expense. 

Net income for the first nine months of 2020 was 

$309 million, compared with $16.7 billion in the same period a 
year ago. Net income decreased in the first nine months of 2020, 
compared with the same period a year ago, due to a $12.3 billion 
increase in our provision for credit losses, a $5.5 billion decrease in 
net interest income, and a $5.3 billion decrease in noninterest 
income, partially offset by a $6.6 billion decrease in income tax 
expense. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and the net interest margin are presented on 
a taxable-equivalent basis in Table 1 to consistently reflect 
income from taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity 
securities based on a 21% federal statutory tax rate for the 
periods ending September 30, 2020 and 2019. 

Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in 

both the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, compared 
with the same periods a year ago, driven by unfavorable impacts 
of repricing due to the lower interest rate environment and higher 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization. The 
decrease in third quarter 2020 also reflected changes in the mix 
of earning assets and funding sources. 

For additional information about net interest income and net 

interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest 
Income” section in our 2019 Form 10-K.

In third quarter 2020, service charges on deposit accounts, cash network fees, wire transfer and other remittance fees, and certain other fees were combined into a single line item for deposit-related 
fees; certain fees associated with lending activities were combined into a single line item for lending-related fees; and certain other fees were reclassified to other noninterest income. Prior period 
balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 

For additional information on servicing income, see Note 11 

(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 
increased driven by: 
• 

higher residential real estate held for sale (HFS) origination 
volumes; and 
an increase in production margin in both our retail and 
correspondent production channels, as well as a shift to more 
retail origination volume, which has a higher margin. 

• 

The production margin provides a measure of the 
profitability of our residential held for sale mortgage loan 
originations. Table 2a presents the information used in 
determining the production margin. 

Third quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2019 

Deposit-related fees decreased driven by: 
• 

lower customer transaction volumes and higher average 
consumer deposit account balances due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to 
support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by a lower earnings credit rate due to the lower 
interest rate environment. 

Card fees decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower interchange fees, net of rewards costs, driven by 
decreased purchase volume due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

• 

Servicing income, net increased reflecting: 
• 

higher mortgage servicing right (MSR) valuation gains, net of 
hedge results, driven by favorable hedge results, changes in 
expected servicing costs reflecting economic improvements 
in third quarter 2020 compared with second quarter 2020 
and negative valuation model adjustments made in third 
quarter 2019 reflecting higher prepayment estimates; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others.

Primarily includes the results of Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loss 
mitigation activities, interest rate management activities and changes in estimate to the 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. 

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting higher 
volumes and customer activity in equities trading due to volatility 
in the equity markets. 

Net gains on debt securities increased due to higher gains from 
the sales of agency MBS as a result of portfolio re-balancing and 
actions taken to manage under the asset cap. 

• 

Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees increased 
reflecting higher asset-based fees, partially offset by lower 
transactional revenue. Asset-based fees include fees from 
advisory accounts that are based on a percentage of the market 
value of the assets as of the beginning of the quarter. 

Trust and investment management fees decreased driven by 
lower trust fees due to the sale of our IRT business in third 
quarter 2019. 

Our assets under management (AUM) totaled $797.9 billion 

at September 30, 2020, compared with $691.9 billion at 
September 30, 2019. Substantially all of our AUM is managed by 
our Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating 
segment. Our assets under administration (AUA) totaled 
$1.6 trillion at September 30, 2020 and $1.8 trillion at 
September 30, 2019. Management believes that AUM and AUA 
are useful metrics because they allow investors and others to 
assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation 
of certain asset-based fees. 

Our AUM and AUA included IRT client assets of $22 billion 
and $708 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2020, which we 
continue to administer at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a 
transition services agreement that will terminate no later than 
July 2021. 

Card fees decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower interchange fees, net of rewards costs, driven by 
decreased purchase volume due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

lower realized gains on nonmarketable equity securities; 

Net gains from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

$224 million of net unrealized gains related to a change in 
the accounting measurement model for certain 
nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture 
capital partnerships. 

Other income decreased due to: 
• 

• 

a $1.1 billion gain in third quarter 2019 from the sale of our 
Institutional Retirement and Trust (IRT) business and 
$302 million of gains from the sales of purchased credit-
impaired (PCI) loans in third quarter 2019; and 
a decline in commercial real estate brokerage commissions as 
a result of the sale of Eastdil Secured (Eastdil) in fourth 
quarter 2019; 
partially offset by: 
• 

$228 million of higher equity method investment income 
related to a change in the accounting measurement model 
for certain nonmarketable equity securities from our 
affiliated venture capital partnerships. 

First nine months of 2020 vs. first nine months of 2019 

Deposit-related fees decreased driven by: 
• 

lower customer transaction volumes and higher average 
consumer deposit account balances due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to 
support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by a lower earnings credit rate due to the lower 
interest rate environment. 

Lending-related fees decreased driven by an increase in fee 
waivers and reversals as part of our actions to support customers 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Servicing income, net decreased reflecting: 
• 

higher MSR valuation losses, net of hedge results, as gains 
from favorable hedge results were more than offset by 
valuation adjustments for higher expected servicing costs 
and prepayment estimates due to changes in economic 
conditions; and 
lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others and the impacts of customer accommodations 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

• 

For additional information on servicing income, see Note 11 

(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 
increased driven by: 
• 
• 

higher residential real estate HFS origination volumes; and 
an increase in production margin due to higher margins in 
both our retail and correspondent production channels, as 
well as a shift to more retail origination volume, which has a 
higher margin. For additional information on the production 
margin on residential held for sale mortgage loan 
originations, see Table 2a. 

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting: 
• 

higher income driven by demand for interest rate products 
due to lower interest rates; 
higher volumes and customer activity for equities trading 
due to volatility in the equity markets; and

partially offset by: 
• 

losses due to higher prepayment speeds on agency MBS 
pools, net of hedge gains, and wider credit spreads for non-
agency and certain asset-backed securities. 

measurement model for certain nonmarketable equity 
securities from our affiliated venture capital partnerships; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains, including $658 million related to a 
change in the accounting measurement model for certain 
nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture 
capital partnerships. 

Net gains on debt securities increased due to higher gains from 
the sales of agency MBS as a result of portfolio re-balancing and 
actions taken to manage under the asset cap. 

Net gains from equity securities decreased driven by: 
• 

changes in the value of deferred compensation plan 
investments (largely offset in personnel expense). Refer to 
Table 3a for the results for our deferred compensation plan 
and related investments; 
lower realized gains on nonmarketable equity securities; and 
impairment on equity securities of $1.6 billion, including 
$434 million related to a change in the accounting

a decline in commercial real estate brokerage commissions as 
a result of the sale of Eastdil in fourth quarter 2019; and 
lower equity method investments income;

Third quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2019 

Personnel expense remained relatively flat, reflecting: 
• 

higher salaries expense driven by the impact of annual salary 
increases and higher staffing levels; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower incentive compensation expense. 

Occupancy expense increased due to additional cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Operating losses decreased driven by: 
• 

lower litigation accruals, as third quarter 2019 included a 
$1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual related to retail sales 
practices matters; 

partially offset by: 
• 

increased customer remediation accruals reflecting 
expansions of the population of affected customers, 
remediation payments, and/or remediation time frames for a 
variety of matters. 

12 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by 
decreases in marketing and brand campaign volumes due to the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Restructuring charges increased driven predominantly by 
severance costs, as well as facility closure costs, related to our 
efficiency initiatives that commenced in third quarter 2020. For 
additional information on restructuring charges, see Note 2 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

First nine months of 2020 vs. first nine months of 2019 

Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower deferred compensation expense (offset in net gains 
from equity securities); 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher salaries expense driven by annual salary increases and 
higher staffing levels; and

Table 3a presents results for our deferred compensation 
plan and related hedges. Historically, we used equity securities as 
economic hedges of our deferred compensation plan liabilities. 
Changes in the fair value of the equity securities used as 
economic hedges were recorded in net gains (losses) from equity 
securities within noninterest income. In second quarter 2020, we 
entered into arrangements to transition our economic hedges

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
decreased due to: 
• 
• 

a software impairment in third quarter 2019; and 
a software licensing liability accrual reversal in second quarter 
2020; 

partially offset by: 
• 
• 

higher pension plan settlement expenses; and 
higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit 
assessment expense driven by a higher assessment rate and 
higher deposit balances. 

partially offset by: 
• 
• 

higher cloud computing expenses; and 
higher telecommunications expense related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Occupancy expense increased due to additional cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Operating losses increased driven by: 
• 

higher customer remediation accruals reflecting expansions 
of the population of affected customers, remediation 
payments, and/or remediation time frames for a variety of 
matters; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower litigation accruals as third quarter 2019 included a 
$1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual related to retail sales 
practices matters. 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by 
reduced marketing and brand campaign volumes due to the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Restructuring charges increased driven predominantly by 
severance costs, as well as facility closure costs, related to our 
efficiency initiatives that commenced in third quarter 2020. For 
additional information on restructuring charges, see Note 2 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other expenses decreased driven by: 
• 

a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
ongoing expense management initiatives, as well as the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
lower foreclosed assets expense due to the suspension of 
certain mortgage foreclosure activities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was $645 million in third quarter 2020, 
compared with $1.3 billion in the same period a year ago, driven 
by lower pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate was 24.1% 
for third quarter 2020, compared with 22.1% for the same period 
a year ago. The effective income tax rate for third quarter 2020 
reflected lower pre-tax income and included net discrete income 
tax benefits primarily related to the resolution and reevaluation 
of prior period matters with U.S federal and state tax authorities. 
The effective income tax rate for third quarter 2019 reflected a 
net discrete income tax expense related to the non-tax deductible 
treatment of a $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual. 

Income tax benefit was $3.1 billion in the first nine months of 

2020, compared with income tax expense of $3.5 billion in the 
same period a year ago, driven by lower pre-tax income. The 
effective income tax rate was 111.0% for the first nine months of 
2020, compared with 17.3% for the same period a year ago. The 
effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2020 
reflected lower pre-tax income and included net discrete income 
tax benefits primarily related to the resolution and reevaluation 
of prior period matters with U.S federal and state tax authorities. 
The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2019 
reflected a net discrete income tax expense related to the non-
tax deductible treatment of a $1.6 billion discrete litigation 
accrual, partially offset by net discrete income tax benefits 
related to the results of U.S. federal and state income tax 
examinations.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
Our operating segments are defined by product type and 
customer segment, and their results are based on our 
management reporting process. The management reporting 
process is based on U.S. GAAP with specific adjustments, such as 
for funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, for 
shared revenues and expenses, and tax-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
On February 11, 2020, we announced a new organizational 
structure. We continue to refine the composition of our operating 
segments and allocation methodologies. Additionally, we are still 
in the process of transitioning key leadership positions. We now 
expect to update our operating segment disclosures, including 
comparative financial results, in fourth quarter 2020. These 
changes will not impact previously reported consolidated financial 
results of the Company. Table 4 and the following discussion 
present our results by current operating segment. For additional 
description of our operating segments, including additional 
financial information and the underlying management reporting 
process, see Note 22 (Operating Segments) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We perform a goodwill impairment assessment annually in 

the fourth quarter. Since our last annual assessment, we have 
observed a significant decline in market capitalization given 
deteriorated macroeconomic conditions from the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In first and second quarter 2020, we 
performed interim, quantitative impairment assessments of our 
goodwill with no evidence of goodwill impairment. Given the 
uncertainty of the severity or length of the current economic 
downturn, we continue to monitor our performance against our 
internal forecasts as well as market conditions for circumstances 
that could have a further negative effect on the estimated fair 

Table 4:  Operating Segment Results – Highlights 

values of our reporting units. In third quarter 2020, we performed 
a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment and concluded 
that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting 
units were greater than their carrying amounts as of September 
30, 2020. 

The aggregate fair value of our reporting units calculated 

during our latest interim quantitative assessment exceeded our 
market capitalization as of September 30, 2020. Individual 
reporting unit fair values cannot be directly correlated to the 
Company’s market capitalization. However, we consider several 
factors in the comparison of aggregate fair value to market 
capitalization, including (i) control premiums adjusted for the 
current market environment, which include synergies that may 
not be reflected in current market pricing, (ii) degree of 
complexity and execution risk at the reporting unit level 
compared with the enterprise level, and (iii) issues or risks related 
to the Company level that may not be included in the fair value of 
the individual reporting units. 

In connection with the planned change to our operating 
segment disclosures, we will realign our goodwill to the reporting 
units that underlie our operating segments, which could impact 
the results of our goodwill impairment assessment. We will 
reassess goodwill for impairment at the time of the realignment. 
In addition, we may divest or otherwise wind down certain 
businesses or portfolios of assets in connection with the 
realignment of our operating segments, which may result in the 
impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets related to these 
businesses or portfolios. 

For additional information about goodwill, see Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2019 Form 
10-K.

Third quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and changes in the mix of earning assets and 
funding sources; 
lower deposit-related fees driven by lower customer 
transaction volumes and higher average consumer deposit 
account balances due to the economic slowdown associated 
with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as fee waivers and 
reversals as part of our actions to support customers during 
the COVID-19 pandemic; 
lower net gains from equity securities due to impairments; 
and 

• 

• 

• 

lower other income driven by higher gains in third quarter 
2019 related to sales of PCI loans; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher mortgage banking revenue due to an increase in real 
estate HFS origination volumes and higher MSR valuation 
gains, net of hedge results, driven by favorable hedge results. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher restructuring charges driven predominantly by 
severance costs, as well as facility closure costs, related to 
our efficiency initiatives that commenced in third quarter 
2020. All restructuring charges were included in the 
Community Banking segment. For additional information on

Provision for credit losses increased driven by a decline in 
economic conditions due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher restructuring charges driven predominantly by 
severance costs, as well as facility closure costs, related to 
our efficiency initiatives that commenced in third quarter 
2020. All restructuring charges were included in the 
Community Banking segment. For additional information on 
restructuring charges, see Note 2 (Restructuring Charges) to 
Financial Statements in this Report; and 
higher operating losses, personnel expense, occupancy 
expense, FDIC deposit assessment expense within other 
expense, and charitable donations within other expense; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower advertising and promotion expense and travel and 
entertainment expense within other expense; and 
lower stock-based compensation expense within personnel 
expense and lower deferred compensation plan expense 
within personnel expense (largely offset by net losses from 
equity securities). 

• 

• 

Average deposits increased driven by government stimulus 
programs and lower consumer spending due to the COVID-19 
pandemic.

• 

restructuring charges, see Note 2 (Restructuring Charges) to 
Financial Statements in this Report; 
higher personnel expense, and technology, 
telecommunications and equipment expense; 
higher charitable contributions expense within other 
expense; and 
higher FDIC deposit assessment expense within other 
expense driven by a higher assessment rate and higher 
deposit balances; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower operating losses, as third quarter 2019 included a 
$1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual related to retail sales 
practices matters; and 
lower advertising and promotion expense. 

Average deposits increased driven by government stimulus 
programs and lower consumer spending due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

First nine months of 2020 vs. first nine months of 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment; 
a decrease in deposit-related fees and card fees driven by 
lower customer transaction volumes and higher average 
consumer deposit account balances due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well 
as fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
net losses from equity securities due to impairments and 
changes in the value of deferred compensation plan 
investments (largely offset in personnel expense); and 
lower other income driven by higher gains in third quarter 
2019 related to sales of PCI loans; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher mortgage banking revenue as a result of an increase in 
real estate HFS origination volumes; and 
higher gains on debt securities.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

In third quarter 2020, service charges on deposit accounts, cash network fees, wire transfer and other remittance fees, and certain other fees were combined into a single line item for deposit-related 
fees; certain fees associated with lending activities were combined into a single line item for lending-related fees; and certain other fees were reclassified to other noninterest income. Prior period 
balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
In third quarter 2020, expenses for outside professional services, contract services, and outside data processing were combined into a single line item for professional and outside services expense; 
expenses for technology and equipment and telecommunications were combined into a single line item for technology, telecommunications and equipment expense; and certain other expenses were 
reclassified to other noninterest expense. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
Income tax expense for our Wholesale Banking operating segment included income tax credits related to low income housing and renewable energy investments of $469 million and $1.4 billion for 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, and $422 million and $1.3 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. 

(2) 

(3) 

Third quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, as well as lower average loan balances and 
lower funds transfer pricing credit earned from lower deposit 
balances; 
lower other noninterest income due to lower commercial real 
estate brokerage fees related to our sale of Eastdil in fourth 
quarter 2019, lower community lending investments, lower 
strategic capital and renewable energy equity method 
income, and lower lease income; and 
lower investment banking fees, mortgage banking fees, and 
gains from equity securities; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher gains from trading activities and gains on debt 
securities, as well as higher deposit-related fees. 

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting economic 
uncertainty due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 
commercial loan portfolios, including the oil and gas portfolio. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher other expense, including increased risk management 
expense; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower personnel expense, travel expense within other 
expense, and project-related expense within professional and 
outside services expense. 

Average loans decreased driven by lower loan demand and higher 
paydowns reflecting continued liquidity and strength in the 
capital markets.

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher other expense, including increased risk management 
expense and charitable donations; and 
higher operating losses; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower personnel expense, and lower lease and travel expenses 
within other expense, as well as the impact of the sale of 
Eastdil in fourth quarter 2019. 

Average loans increased reflecting broad-based growth across 
the lines of business driven by draws of revolving lines due to the 
economic slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Average deposits increased reflecting customers’ preferences for 
liquidity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Average deposits decreased reflecting continued actions taken 
to manage under the asset cap. 

First nine months of 2020 vs. first nine months of 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher investment asset 
spread and higher average loan balances and higher funds 
transfer pricing credit earned from higher deposit balances; 
and 
lower noninterest income driven by lower other income from 
community lending investments, lower strategic capital and 
renewable energy equity method income, and lower 
commercial real estate brokerage fees related to our sale of 
Eastdil in fourth quarter 2019, as well as lower mortgage 
banking fees and net losses from equity securities; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher investment banking fees, gains from trading activities, 
gains on debt securities, and deposit-related fees. 

Provision for credit losses increased due to: 
• 

increases in the ACL reflecting current and forecasted 
economic conditions due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
higher charge-offs in the oil and gas, commercial real estate, 
and commercial capital portfolios.

In third quarter 2020, service charges on deposit accounts, cash network fees, wire transfer and other remittance fees, and certain other fees were combined into a single line item for deposit-related 
fees; certain fees associated with lending activities were combined into a single line item for lending-related fees; and certain other fees were reclassified to other noninterest income. Prior period 
balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
In third quarter 2020, expenses for outside professional services, contract services, and outside data processing were combined into a single line item for professional and outside services expense; 
expenses for technology and equipment and telecommunications were combined into a single line item for technology, telecommunications and equipment expense; and certain other expenses were 
reclassified to other noninterest expense. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 

(2) 

Third quarter 2020 vs. third quarter 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher funds transfer pricing 
credit earned from higher average deposit balances; and 
lower noninterest income predominantly related to a 
$1.1 billion gain from the sale of our IRT business in third 
quarter 2019 (in other income). 

• 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

lower personnel expense from lower incentive compensation; 
lower technology, telecommunications and equipment 
expense driven by a $103 million impairment of capitalized 
software reflecting a reevaluation of software under 
development in third quarter 2019; and 
lower operating losses; 

• 
partially offset by: 

• 

higher project spending on regulatory and compliance 
related initiatives included within other expense. 

Average loans increased driven by growth in real estate 1-4 first 
mortgage loans. 

Average deposits increased primarily due to growth in brokerage 
clients’ cash balances.

The following discussions provide additional information for 
client assets we oversee in our retail brokerage advisory and trust 
and investment management business lines. 

Retail Brokerage Client Assets  Brokerage advisory, commissions 
and other fees are received for providing full-service and discount 
brokerage services to retail brokerage clients. A majority of our 
retail brokerage client assets are in accounts that earn brokerage 
commissions generally based on the number and size of 
transactions executed at the client’s direction. In addition to 
these types of accounts, we also offer advisory account 
relationships as an important component of our broader strategy 
of meeting brokerage clients’ financial needs. Fees from advisory 
accounts are based on a percentage of the market value of the 
assets as of the beginning of the quarter, which vary across the 
account types based on the distinct services provided, and are 
affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and 
outflows. A majority of our brokerage advisory, commissions and 
other fee income is earned from advisory accounts. Table 4d 
shows advisory account client assets as a percentage of total 
retail brokerage client assets at September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First nine months of 2020 vs. first nine months of 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher funds transfer pricing 
credit earned from higher average deposit balances; and 
lower noninterest income largely related to a $1.1 billion gain 
from the sale of our IRT business in third quarter 2019 (in 
other income), as well as net losses from equity securities 
driven by a decline in deferred compensation plan 
investment results (largely offset by lower personnel 
expense), and lower trust and investment management 
income; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher retail brokerage advisory fees (priced at the beginning 
of the quarter). 

Provision for credit losses increased due to current and 
forecasted economic conditions due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 

lower personnel expense driven by lower deferred 
compensation plan expense (largely offset by net losses from 
equity securities) and lower incentive compensation; 
lower technology, telecommunications and equipment 
expense driven by a $103 million impairment of capitalized 
software reflecting a reevaluation of software under 
development in third quarter 2019, and the reversal of an 
accrual for software costs in second quarter 2020; and 
lower operating losses;

Advisory accounts include assets that are financial advisor-
directed and separately managed by third-party managers, as well 
as certain client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee 
for advisory and other services, but do not have investment 
discretion. For third quarter 2020 and 2019, the average fee rate

Trust and Investment Client Assets Under Management  We 
earn trust and investment management fees from managing and 
administering assets, including mutual funds, separate accounts, 
and personal trust assets, through our asset management and 
wealth businesses. Prior to the sale of our IRT business, which 
closed on July 1, 2019, we also earned fees from managing 
employee benefit trusts through the retirement business. Our 
asset management business is conducted by Wells Fargo Asset 
Management (WFAM), which offers Wells Fargo proprietary 
mutual funds and manages institutional separate accounts, and 

our wealth business, which manages assets for high net worth 
clients. Generally, our trust and investment management fee 
income is earned from AUM where we have discretionary 
management authority over the investments and generate fees 
as a percentage of the market value of the AUM. For additional 
information on the sale of our IRT business, including its impact 
on our AUM and AUA, see the “Earnings Performance – 
Noninterest Income” section in this Report. Table 4f presents 
AUM activity for the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 
and 2019.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At September 30, 2020, our assets totaled $1.92 trillion, down 
$5.3 billion from December 31, 2019. The decline in assets 
reflected: 
• 
• 
• 

a decrease in debt securities of $20.7 billion; 
a decrease in loans of $42.2 billion; 
a decrease in federal funds sold and securities purchased 
under resale agreements of $32.8 billion; and 
a decrease in equity securities of $17.1 billion; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

an increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 
$105.5 billion. 

The following discussion provides additional information 

about the major components of our balance sheet. Information 
regarding our capital and changes in our asset mix is included in 
the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” and “Capital 
Management” sections and Note 23 (Regulatory and Agency 
Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses, of $79 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $26 million related to held-to-maturity debt 
securities at September 30, 2020. The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities was $0 at December 31, 2019, due to our adoption of CECL on 
January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, which includes the allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Table 5 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in 
available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities, which decreased in balance sheet carrying value from 
December 31, 2019, as purchases were more than offset by 
runoff and sales. While the overall portfolio decreased from 
December 31, 2019, HTM debt securities increased due to 
actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital 
management purposes. See Note 5 (Available-for-Sale and Held-
to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information on AFS and HTM debt 
securities, including a summary of debt securities by security 
type. 

The total net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities 
increased from December 31, 2019, driven by lower interest 
rates, partially offset by wider credit spreads. For a discussion of 
our investment management objectives and practices, see the 
“Balance Sheet Analysis” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. Also, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in 
this Report for information on our use of investments to manage 
liquidity and interest rate risk.

Loan Portfolios 
Table 6 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans decreased from 
December 31, 2019, driven by: 
• 

lower demand for originations of new loans and lower 
utilization on existing revolving loans in commercial and 
industrial loans; and 
loan paydowns on continued customer liquidity from 
strength in capital markets. 

• 

Consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2019, due to: 
• 

paydowns exceeding originations in first and junior lien 
mortgage loans; and 
lower consumer spending and originations in credit cards; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

the repurchase of $26.9 billion of first lien mortgage loans 
from GNMA loan securitization pools, including $21.9 billion 
in third quarter 2020.

Deposits 
Deposits increased from December 31, 2019, reflecting: 
• 

consumer and wealth customers’ preferences for liquidity 
given the economic uncertainty associated with the 

COVID-19 pandemic, loan payment deferrals, government 
stimulus programs, and lower customer spending; 

partially offset by: 
• 

actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in 
declines in interest-bearing checking, other time deposits, 
such as brokered certificates of deposit (CDs), and deposits 
in non-U.S. offices. 

Table 7 provides additional information regarding deposits. 

Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest 
income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided

Equity 
Total equity was $182.0 billion at September 30, 2020, compared 
with $188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was 
driven by: 
• 

common stock repurchases of $3.4 billion (substantially all of 
which occurred in first quarter 2020); and 
dividends of $5.6 billion; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

issuances of common stock of $2.4 billion predominantly 
related to employee stock ownership plans.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our 
off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend 
and purchase debt and equity securities, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other 
commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the 
financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or 
liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. For 
additional information on our contractual obligations that may 
require future cash payments, see the “Off-Balance Sheet 
Arrangements – Contractual Cash Obligations” section in our 
2019 Form 10-K. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, we 
are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For additional information, see Note 6 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 13 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and 
Collateral, and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 10 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, direct pay 
letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange 
and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types 
of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 13 
(Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral, and Other 
Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and 
volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which 
is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined. The notional 
amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. For additional information about how we 
manage risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K. The discussion that follows supplements our 
discussion of the management of certain risks contained in the 
“Risk Management” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower 
or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance 
with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of our 
assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain 
derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Credit Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, Credit 
Risk, which is part of the Company’s Independent Risk 
Management (IRM) organization, has primary oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO) and also provides periodic reports related to credit 
risk to the Board’s Credit Committee. 

Loan Portfolios 
The following discussion focuses on our loan portfolios, which 
represent the largest component of assets on our balance sheet 
for which we have credit risk. Table 8 presents our total loans 
outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing 
receivable.

Changes in interest rates; 

• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Reputation risk. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in third quarter 2020 
continued to be affected by the economic impact that the 
COVID-19 pandemic had on our customer base. Third quarter 
2020 results reflected: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $8.0 billion at September 30, 2020, up 

from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans increased to $4.4 billion at September 30, 
2020, compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans increased to $3.6 billion at 
September 30, 2020, compared with $3.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.87% of 
total loans at September 30, 2020, compared with 0.56% at 
December 31, 2019. 

• 

•  Net loan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of our 
average commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 
0.29% and 0.30% in the third quarter and 0.33% and 0.44% in 
the first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared with 
0.11% and 0.46% in the third quarter and 0.12% and 0.47% in 
the first nine months of 2019. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were $108 million 
and $549 million in our commercial and consumer portfolios, 
respectively, at September 30, 2020, compared with 
$78 million and $855 million at December 31, 2019. 
Provision for credit losses for loans was $751 million and 
$14.1 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2020, respectively, compared with $695 million and 
$2.0 billion for the same periods a year ago. 
The ACL for loans totaled $20.5 billion, or 2.22% of total 
loans, at September 30, 2020, up from $10.5 billion, or 
1.09%, at December 31, 2019.

quality trends follows. 

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate 
including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING RELIEF  The CARES Act provides 
banks optional, temporary relief from accounting for certain loan 
modifications as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The 
modifications must be related to the adverse effects of 
COVID-19, and certain other criteria are required to be met in 
order to apply the relief. In first quarter 2020, we elected to apply 
the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act, which expires no later 
than December 31, 2020. 

On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued the 
Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for 
Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Coronavirus (Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The 
Interagency Statement provides additional TDR relief as it 
clarifies that it is not necessary to consider the impact of 
COVID-19 on the financial condition of a borrower in connection 
with short-term (e.g., six months or less) loan modifications 
related to COVID-19 provided the borrower is current at the date 
the modification program is implemented. For additional 
information regarding the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act 
and the clarifying TDR accounting guidance from the Interagency 
Statement, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The TDR relief provided under the CARES Act, as well as from 

the Interagency Statement, does not change our processes for 
monitoring the credit quality of our loan portfolios or for 
updating our measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 
loans based on expected losses. 

Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief provided by 

the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement impacts our 
regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications related to 
COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting normally 
required with TDR classification. 

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations 
During the first nine months of 2020, we provided 
accommodations to customers in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, including fee reversals for consumer and small 
business banking customers, and payment deferrals, fee waivers, 
covenant waivers, and other expanded assistance for mortgage, 
credit card, automobile, small business, personal and commercial 
lending customers. Certain foreclosure, collection and credit 
bureau reporting activities were also suspended. Additionally, we 
deferred rental payments on certain leased assets for which we 
are the lessor.

Table 9 and Table 9a summarize the unpaid principal balance 

(UPB) of commercial and consumer loans that received 
accommodations under loan modification programs established 
to assist customers with the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic (COVID-related modifications) and that remained in a 
deferral period as of September 30, 2020. These amounts 
included accommodations made for customers with loans 
reported on our consolidated balance sheet and excluded 
accommodations made for customers with loans that we service 
for others. COVID-related modifications primarily included 
payment deferrals of principal, interest or both as well as interest 
and fee waivers. 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of net 
charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual status for those 
customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or 
nonaccrual status. Customers requiring assistance after receiving 
payment deferrals under the programs described in Tables 9 and 
9a may be eligible to receive modifications consistent with those 
offered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as interest rate 
reductions, term extensions, or principal forgiveness. 

Of the total modifications granted during the first nine 
months of 2020, $222 million and $6.1 billion of unpaid principal 
balance of commercial and consumer loans, respectively, were 
classified as TDRs as of September 30, 2020, including 
$201 million and $4.0 billion, respectively, that were already 
classified as a TDR when the COVID-related modification was 
granted. 

For information related to loans that are classified as TDRs, 
see Note 6 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early 
identification of developing risk and to support our determination 
of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following 
discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our 
significant loan portfolios. See Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each 
of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to 
market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally 
subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to 
individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to federal 
banking regulators’ definitions of pass and criticized categories 
with the criticized category including special mention, 
substandard, doubtful, and loss categories. 

The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio totaled $337.9 billion, or 37% of total loans, at 
September 30, 2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) of 
average loans for this portfolio was 0.34% and 0.42% in the third 
quarter and first nine months of 2020, respectively, compared 
with 0.17% for both the third quarter and first nine months of 
2019. At September 30, 2020, 0.89% of this portfolio was 
nonaccruing, compared with 0.44% at December 31, 2019. 
Nonaccrual loans in this portfolio increased $1.4 billion from 
December 31, 2019, a significant portion of which was in the oil, 
gas and pipelines category due to the economic impact of the 

COVID-19 pandemic. Also, $24.6 billion of the commercial and 
industrial loan and lease financing portfolio was internally 
classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at 
September 30, 2020, compared with $16.6 billion at 
December 31, 2019, reflecting increases primarily in the oil, gas 
and pipelines, real estate and construction, entertainment and 
recreation, and retail categories due to the economic impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and lease 

financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory, and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment. 

Table 10 provides our commercial and industrial loans and 

lease financing by industry, and includes non-U.S. loans of 
$62.8 billion and $71.7 billion at September 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. Significant industry 
concentrations of non-U.S. loans included $33.0 billion and 
$31.2 billion in the financials except banks category, and 
$13.0 billion and $19.9 billion in the banks category, at 
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. The 
oil, gas and pipelines category included $1.5 billion of non-U.S. 
loans at both September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The 
industry categories are based on the North American Industry 
Classification System. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 

concentration, is comprised of loans to investment firms, financial 
vehicles, and non-bank creditors, including those that invest in 
financial assets backed predominantly by commercial or 
residential real estate or consumer loan assets. We had 
$72.8 billion and $75.9 billion of loans originated by our Asset 
Backed Finance (ABF) and Financial Institution Group (FIG) lines 
of business at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. These ABF and FIG loans are limited to a percentage

of the value of the underlying financial assets considering 
underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance. 
These ABF and FIG loans may also have other features to manage 
credit risk such as cross-collateralization, credit enhancements, 
and contractual re-margining of collateral supporting the loans. 
Loans to financials except banks included collateralized loan 
obligations (CLOs) in loan form of $7.7 billion and $7.0 billion at 
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. 
Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $8.1 billion and 

$9.2 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at September 30, 

Table 10:  Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing by Industry 

2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines 
nonaccrual loans increased at September 30, 2020, compared 
with December 31, 2019, due to new downgrades to nonaccrual 
status in 2020. 

In addition to the oil, gas and pipelines category, industries 

with escalated credit monitoring include real estate and 
construction, retail (including restaurants), and hotels/motels.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to federal 
banking regulators' definitions of pass and criticized categories 
with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included 
$8.1 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans, totaled $144.4 billion, or 16% 
of total loans, at September 30, 2020, and consisted of 
$121.9 billion of mortgage loans and $22.5 billion of construction 
loans. 

Table 11 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type 

with the related nonaccrual totals at September 30, 2020. The 
portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. 
The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in 
California, New York, Florida, and Texas, which combined 
represented 48% of the total CRE portfolio. By property type, the 

largest concentrations are office buildings at 26% and apartments 
at 19% of the portfolio. CRE nonaccrual loans totaled 0.95% of 
the CRE outstanding balance at September 30, 2020, compared 
with 0.43% at December 31, 2019. The increase in CRE 
nonaccrual loans was predominantly driven by the hotel/motel, 
shopping center, and office buildings property types and reflected 
the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At 
September 30, 2020, we had $11.2 billion of criticized CRE 
mortgage loans, compared with $3.8 billion at December 31, 
2019, and $1.5 billion of criticized CRE construction loans, 
compared with $187 million at December 31, 2019. The increase 
in criticized CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans was driven 
by the hotel/motel, shopping center, and retail (excluding 
shopping center) property types and reflected the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At September 30, 2020, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$71.2 billion, representing approximately 8% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $80.5 billion, or 
approximately 8% of total consolidated loans outstanding, at 
December 31, 2019. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of 
our consolidated total assets at both September 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which 
gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk such as 
guarantees and collateral and may be different from the reporting 
based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. based on 

our assessment of risk at September 30, 2020, was the United 
Kingdom, which totaled $38.1 billion, or approximately 2% of our 
total assets, and included $12.2 billion of sovereign claims. Our 

Table 12:  Select Country Exposures 

United Kingdom sovereign claims arise predominantly from 
deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to 
regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. The 
United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union (Brexit) on 
January 31, 2020, and is currently subject to a transition period 
during which the terms and conditions of its exit are being 
negotiated. For additional information on our plans to address 
Brexit, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Country Risk Exposure” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. For 
additional information on risks associated with Brexit, see the 
“Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 12 provides information regarding our top 
20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 12: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and net 
short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 

• 

•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes 

some loans with an interest-only feature as part of the loan terms 
and some with adjustable-rate features. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both September 30, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019. We believe we have manageable adjustable-
rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our mortgage loan 
portfolios, including ARM loans that have negative amortizing 
features that were acquired in prior business combinations. We 
do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate 
mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly 
referred to within the financial services industry as negative 
amortizing mortgage loans. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL on January 1, 2020, our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which had a carrying value 
of $568 million, were reclassified as purchased credit-
deteriorated (PCD) loans. PCD loans are generally accounted for 
in the same manner as non-PCD loans. For additional information 
on PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For additional information on our modification 
programs, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K. For additional information on customer 
accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in this Report. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan 
portfolio. These credit risk indicators on the mortgage portfolio 
exclude government insured/guaranteed loans. Loans 30 days or 
more delinquent at September 30, 2020, totaled $3.1 billion, or 
1% of total mortgages, compared with $3.0 billion, or 1%, at 
December 31, 2019. Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 
totaled $6.1 billion, or 2% of total mortgages at September 30, 
2020, compared with $7.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2019. 
Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 
$2.0 billion at September 30, 2020, or 1% of total mortgages, 
compared with $2.5 billion, or 1%, at December 31, 2019. 
Information regarding credit quality indicators can be found in 
Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Real estate 1-4 mortgage loans by state are presented in 
Table 14. Our real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans to borrowers 
in California represented 13% of total loans at September 30, 
2020, located predominantly within the larger metropolitan 
areas, with no single California metropolitan area consisting of 
more than 5% of total loans. We monitor changes in real estate 
values and underlying economic or market conditions for all 
geographic areas of our real estate 1-4 family mortgage 
portfolios as part of our credit risk management process. Our 
underwriting and periodic review of loans and lines secured by 
residential real estate collateral includes original appraisals 
adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates 
from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property 
values. Additional information about appraisals and AVMs and our 
policy for their use can be found in Note 6 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Real Estate 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans” section in our 2019 
Form 10-K.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

First Lien Mortgage Portfolio  Our total real estate 1-4 family 
first lien mortgage portfolio (first mortgage) increased 
$1.1 billion from December 31, 2019, driven by our repurchase of 
$26.9 billion of loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, 
including $21.9 billion in third quarter 2020, and mortgage loan 
originations of $44.1 billion that were more than offset by 
paydowns. We also reclassified $9.0 billion of loans that were 
designated as mortgage loans held for sale (MLHFS) in second 
quarter 2020 to held for investment in third quarter 2020. 

Net loan charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of average 

first mortgage loans were 0.00% in both the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2020, compared with a net recovery of 0.01% 
and 0.02%, respectively, for the same periods a year ago.

Nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion at September 30, 2020, up 
$491 million from December 31, 2019. The increase in nonaccrual 
loans from December 31, 2019 was driven by COVID-related loan 
payment deferrals that did not qualify for legislative or regulatory 
relief, as well as the implementation of CECL, which required PCI 
loans to be classified as nonaccruing based on performance. For 
additional information, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and 
Foreclosed Assets)” section in this Report.

Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio  The junior lien mortgage 
portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It is 
not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, 
interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates, and 
similar features. Junior lien loan products are mostly amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. 

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our 

junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that 
influence the frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien 
mortgage performance when the first mortgage loan is 
delinquent. Table 16 shows certain delinquency and loss 
information for the junior lien mortgage portfolio and lists the 
top five states by outstanding balance. The decrease in 
outstanding balances since December 31, 2019, predominantly 

reflected loan paydowns. Beginning in second quarter 2020, we 
suspended the origination of junior lien mortgages. As of 
September 30, 2020, 4% of the outstanding balance of the junior 
lien mortgage portfolio was associated with loans that had a 
combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. Of those 
junior lien mortgages with a CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 3% 
were 30 days or more past due. CLTV means the ratio of the total 
loan balance of first mortgages and junior lien mortgages 
(including unused line amounts for credit line products) to 
property collateral value. The unsecured portion (the outstanding 
amount that was in excess of the most recent property collateral 
value) of the outstanding balances of these loans totaled 1% of 
the junior lien mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2020. For 
additional information on consumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 
6.12 in Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report.

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and are therefore included with other non-PCD loans in this table. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit portfolios 
generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable 
interest rate and payment options available during the draw 
period of (1) interest only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal 
balance plus accrued interest. As of September 30, 2020, lines of 
credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-only option. 
During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 
increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 
of borrowers in our first and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In 
September 2020, excluding borrowers with COVID-related loan 
modification payment deferrals, approximately 43% of borrowers 
paid the minimum amount due and approximately 52% paid more 
than the minimum amount due. The rest were either delinquent 
or paid less than the minimum amount due. For the borrowers 
with an interest-only payment feature, approximately 28% paid 
the minimum amount due and approximately 67% paid more than 
the minimum amount due. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may experience 

higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their 
draw or term period. We have considered this increased inherent 
risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only 
to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Table 17 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
junior lien mortgages, including lines and loans, and first lien lines 
segregated into scheduled end-of-draw or end-of-term periods 
and products that are currently amortizing, or in balloon 
repayment status. At September 30, 2020, $383 million, or 2%, of 
lines in their draw period were 30 days or more past due, 

compared with $377 million, or 5%, of amortizing lines of credit. 
Included in the amortizing amounts in Table 17 is $64 million of 
end-of-term balloon payments which were past due. The 
unfunded credit commitments for junior and first lien lines 
totaled $55.7 billion at September 30, 2020.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2029, with annual scheduled amounts through 2029 ranging from $1.5 billion to $4.1 billion and averaging 
$2.7 billion per year. 

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $36.0 billion at 
September 30, 2020, which represented 4% of our total 
outstanding loans. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our 
credit card portfolio was 2.71% for third quarter 2020, compared 
with 3.22% for third quarter 2019, and 3.39% and 3.54% for the 
first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in 
the net charge-off rate in the third quarter and first nine months 
of 2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, was driven 
by payment deferral activities in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic and the effects of government stimulus programs. 

AUTOMOBILE  Our automobile portfolio totaled $48.5 billion at 
September 30, 2020. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our 
automobile portfolio was 0.25% for third quarter 2020, compared 
with 0.65% for third quarter 2019, and 0.60% and 0.64% for the 
first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in 
the net charge-off rate in the third quarter and first nine months 
of 2020, compared with the same periods in 2019, was driven by 
payment deferral activities in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic and stronger recoveries from higher used car values. 

OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other revolving 
credit and installment loans totaled $33.2 billion at 
September 30, 2020, and predominantly included student and 
securities-based loans. Our private student loan portfolio totaled 
$10.0 billion at September 30, 2020. On September 22, 2020, we 
notified customers of our exit from the student lending business. 
New applications from current customers will be accepted for the 
2020-2021 academic year until January 28, 2021, with final 
disbursement of funds to colleges by June 30, 2021. The net 
charge-off rate (annualized) for other revolving credit and 
installment loans was 0.80% for third quarter 2020, compared 
with 1.60% for third quarter 2019, and 1.16% and 1.54% for the 
first nine months of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in 
the net charge-off rate in the third quarter and first nine months 
of 2020, compared with the same periods a year ago, was driven 
by payment deferral activities in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  Table 18 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs) for 
each of the last four quarters. Total NPAs increased $378 million 
from second quarter 2020 to $8.2 billion. Nonaccrual loans of 
$8.0 billion increased $417 million from second quarter 2020. The 
increase in nonaccrual loans was due to the economic impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, including real estate 1-4 family 
mortgage loans in COVID-related payment deferral programs 
that were classified as nonaccrual because they did not qualify for 
legislative or regulatory relief. Customer payment deferral 
activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may 
delay recognition of delinquencies for customers who otherwise 
would have moved into nonaccrual status. Prior to January 1, 
2020, PCI loans were excluded from nonaccrual loans because 
they continued to earn interest income from accretable yield, 
independent of performance in accordance with their contractual 
terms. However, as a result of our adoption of CECL on January 1, 

2020, $275 million of real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans were 
reclassified from PCI to PCD loans, and as a result, were also 
classified as nonaccrual loans given their contractual delinquency. 
For additional information on PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

For information about when we generally place loans on 

nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 
10-K. For additional information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in this 
Report. 

Foreclosed assets of $156 million were down $39 million 

from second quarter 2020.

Real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on foreclosed assets, see Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 10-K.

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, we classified $275 million of PCD loans as nonaccruing based on performance. 

• 

• 

• 

74% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest 
and 70% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
both principal and interest, but were on nonaccrual status 
because the full or timely collection of interest or principal 
had become uncertain. 
of the $1.3 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$848 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered in developing our allowance for loan losses. 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 
financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under our 
proprietary modification programs, customers may be required to 
provide updated documentation, and some programs require 
completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate 
sustained performance before the loan can be removed from 
nonaccrual status. 

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in 
accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that are 
paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities. 

We believe exposure to loss on nonaccrual loans is mitigated 

by the following factors at September 30, 2020: 
• 

92% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 94% are secured by real estate and 90% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $701 million and $1.0 billion have already been 
recognized on 18% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 32% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively, in accordance 
with our charge-off policies. Once we write down loans to the 
net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated 
costs to sell), we re-evaluate each loan regularly and record

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed automobiles. 

Foreclosed assets at September 30, 2020, included 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 

$104 million of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 21% is 
predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining amount of 
foreclosed assets has been written down to estimated net 
realizable value. Of the $156 million in foreclosed assets at 
September 30, 2020, 52% have been in the foreclosed assets 
portfolio one year or less. 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended certain 
mortgage foreclosure activities, which may affect the amount of 
our foreclosed assets for the remainder of the year. For additional 
information on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 6 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

For additional information on our nonaccrual policies when a 
restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Table 22 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the 
period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as 
foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove 
loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if they 
have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and qualify 
as new loans. 

Table 21 provides information regarding the recorded 
investment of loans modified in TDRs. The allowance for loan 
losses for TDRs was $732 million and $1.0 billion at 
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. See 
Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
regarding TDRs. In those situations where principal is forgiven, 
the entire amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off. 
When we delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of 
principal (principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of 
forbearance if that amount is not considered fully collectible. As 
part of our actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we have provided borrowers relief in the form of loan 
modifications. Under the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, loan modifications related to the COVID-19 
pandemic will not be classified as TDRs if they meet certain 
eligibility criteria. For additional information on the CARES Act 
and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality Overview – Troubled 
Debt Restructuring Relief” section in this Report.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 

(2)  Other outflows consist of normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held for sale. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market 

terms qualify as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 

(3)  Net change in trial modifications includes inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 

modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

delinquencies in consumer loans as payment deferral activities 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic delayed 
recognition of delinquencies for customers who would have 
otherwise moved into past due status. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 
repayments are largely insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the 
VA for mortgages at September 30, 2020, were up from 
December 31, 2019, driven by our repurchases of loans more 
than 90 days past due from GNMA loan securitization pools. 
Table 23 reflects loans 90 days or more past due and still 
accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed. 
For additional information on delinquencies by loan class, see

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 90 
days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 
family mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under 
regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later 
delinquency, usually 120 days past due. Prior to January 1, 2020, 
PCI loans were excluded from loans 90 days or more past due and 
still accruing because they continued to earn interest income 
from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance 
with their contractual terms. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and classified as 
accruing or nonaccruing based on performance. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding 

insured/guaranteed loans, at September 30, 2020, were down 
$276 million, or 30%, from December 31, 2019 due to lower

(1)  Quarterly net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

Table 24 presents net loan charge-offs for third quarter 2020 and 
the previous four quarters. 

The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in third 

quarter 2020 from the prior quarter was driven by lower 
commercial and industrial losses predominantly in our oil and gas 
portfolio, as well as lower commercial real estate mortgage 
losses. The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in third 
quarter 2020 from the prior quarter was driven by lower losses in 
our credit card and automobile portfolios. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could delay the recognition of net loan charge-offs. For 
additional information on customer accommodations in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded 
credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans 
and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for 
sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities 
classified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, other 
financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in 
leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. For additional information on our ACL for loans, see 
Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our allowance for credit losses for debt securities, 
see the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale and Held-
To-Maturity Debt Securities” section and Note 5 (Available-for-
Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Table 25 presents the allocation of the ACL for loans by loan 
segment and class for the most recent quarter end and last four 
year ends. The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by 
portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan 
class) is included in Note 6 (Loans and Related Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Disclosure is not comparative due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 
Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 25 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans increased $10.0 billion, or 96%, from 
December 31, 2019, driven by a $11.3 billion increase in the ACL 
for loans in the first nine months of 2020 reflecting current and 
forecasted economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease as a result of adopting 
CECL. Total provision for credit losses for loans was $751 million 
in third quarter 2020, compared with $695 million in third quarter 
2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses for loans in 
third quarter 2020, compared with the same period a year ago, 
reflected an increase in the ACL for loans due to the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans. The scenarios include a base case 
considered to be the most likely economic forecast, along with an 
optimistic (upside) and a pessimistic (downside) economic 
forecast. Our estimate of the ACL for loans at September 30, 
2020, was based on a weighting of the base case and downside 

economic scenarios of 80% and 20%, respectively, with no 
weighting applied to the upside scenario. The base case economic 
forecast assumed near-term economic stress recovering into late 
2021. The downside scenario assumed more sustained adverse 
economic impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic 
compared with the base case. The downside scenario assumed 
U.S. real GDP increasing slowly and not fully recovering during the 
remainder of 2020 and 2021, and a sustained elevation in the U.S. 
unemployment rate until mid-2022. We considered expectations 
for the impact of government economic stimulus programs in 
effect on September 30, 2020; however, we did not consider the 
impact of future government economic stimulus programs. In 
addition, we considered expectations for the impact of customer 
accommodation activity, as well as the estimated impact on 
certain industries that we consider to be directly and most 
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In addition to quantitative estimates, we consider qualitative 

factors that represent risks inherent in our processes and 
assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling 
assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors,

ACL for loans generally reflected improvement from our prior 
expectations resulting in lower loss expectations in the 
quantitative component of our ACL for loans at September 30, 
2020. However, we significantly increased the qualitative 
component of our ACL for loans at September 30, 2020, to 
consider the significant uncertainty related to the duration and 
severity of the economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the incremental risks to our loan portfolio, including 
specifically impacted industries in our commercial loan portfolio. 
The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at June 30 and September 30, 2020, are 
presented in Table 26.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
GDP), among other factors. Based on economic conditions at the 
end of third quarter 2020, it was difficult to estimate the length 
and severity of the economic downturn that may result from the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of other factors that may 
influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding 
requirements for future amounts of the ACL, including the impact 
of economic stimulus programs and customer accommodation 
activity. The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to result in the 
recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in 
our allowance for credit losses, particularly if the impact on the 
economy worsens. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $20.5 billion at 

September 30, 2020, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb expected credit losses from 
the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and 
reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including 
economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans 
to changes in the economic and business environment, it is 
possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  For 
information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk 

Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability For Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in government-sponsored 
entity (GSE)-guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-
guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage 
securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by 
institutional investors. In connection with our servicing activities, 
we could become subject to consent orders and settlement 
agreements with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing 
issues and practices. In general, these can require us to provide 
customers with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and 
foreclosure prevention and assistance, and can result in the 
imposition of certain monetary penalties. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement of these advances vary 
by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. Due to 
continued customer requests for payment deferrals as a result of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of our servicing advances of 
principal and interest remained elevated in third quarter 2020. 
The amount of these advances may continue to increase if 
additional payment deferrals are provided. Payment deferrals also 
delay the collection of contractually specified servicing fees, 
resulting in lower net servicing income. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, 

delinquency status continues to advance for loans with COVID-
related payment deferrals, which has resulted in an increase in 
delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase 
in loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. Our option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan 
securitization pools becomes exercisable when three scheduled 
loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally 
repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total 
consolidated assets do not change. In third quarter 2020, we 
repurchased $21.9 billion of these delinquent loans, substantially 
all of which had COVID-related payment deferrals. 

Loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in 
accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in 
future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance 
with guidance issued by GNMA, loans repurchased after June 30, 
2020 with COVID-related payment deferrals are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. At September 30, 2020, the amount of 
repurchased GNMA loans with COVID-related payment deferrals 
that were ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan 
securitization pools due to this requirement was $21.0 billion. 
For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
our 2019 Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage 
banking activities, see Note 11 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of our Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management

Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. At the management level we utilize a 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee (Corporate ALCO), which 
consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, 
to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the Board’s 
Finance Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As 
discussed in more detail for market risk activities below, we 
employ separate management level oversight specific to market 
risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk, which potentially can have 
a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
(for example, if assets reprice faster than liabilities and 
interest rates are generally rising, earnings will initially 
increase); 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts (for example, when the general level of 
interest rates is rising, we may increase rates paid on 
checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is 
less than the general rise in market interest rates); 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts (for example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs 
differently); 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change (for example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower 
than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income); or 
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage origination 
volume, the fair value of MSRs and other financial 
instruments, the value of the pension liability and other 
items affecting earnings. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest 
income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would 
reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in 
the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice 
downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities. 

Our most recent simulations estimate net interest income 
sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower 
and higher interest rates. Measured impacts from standardized 
ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (instantaneous changes) are 
summarized in Table 27, indicating net interest income sensitivity 
relative to the Company’s base net interest income plan. Ramp 
scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across 
the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one, and the 
full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the 
base scenario in year two. The following describes the simulation 
assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 27: 

44 

• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth 
across assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with 

the changes in interest rates are held constant. 

•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit mix 
is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the 
alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The sensitivity results above do not capture interest rate 
sensitive noninterest income and expense impacts. Our interest 
rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly 
driven by mortgage banking activities, and may move in the 
opposite direction of our net interest income. Mortgage 
originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates 
and generally increase, particularly refinancing activity, in 
response to lower interest rates. Mortgage results are also 
impacted by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. 
See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 
Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this 
Report for additional information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from 
changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that 
reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, 
for the trading portfolio, our trading assets are (before the 
effects of certain economic hedges) generally less sensitive to 
changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities. As a 
result, net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts 
and expands as interest rates rise and fall, respectively. The 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities and loans, which, along with the 
effects of related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest

our interest rate exposures. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – 
Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section 
in this Report for additional information on the use of the 
available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios. The 
notional or contractual amount, credit risk amount and fair value 
of the derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures 
as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, are 
presented in Note 15 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in two 
main ways: 
• 

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, 
swaptions, futures, forwards and options. 

• 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
additional information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” 
section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

While our hedging activities are designed to balance our 
mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. For example, the change in the value of ARM 
production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates 
may or may not be fully offset by index-based financial 
instruments used as economic hedges for such ARMs. Hedge 
results may also be impacted as the overall level of hedges 
changes as interest rates change, or as there are other changes in 
the market for mortgage forwards that may affect the implied 
carry on the MSRs. 

The total carrying value of our residential and commercial 
MSRs was $7.7 billion at September 30, 2020, and $12.9 billion at 
December 31, 2019. The weighted average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.13% at September 30, 
2020, and 4.25% at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of our 
total MSRs represented 0.52% and 0.79% of mortgage loans 
serviced for others at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 
2019, respectively. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis 
risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in the 
trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s market 
risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In 
addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting 
the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance 
Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk 
matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has primary 
oversight responsibility for market risk. The Market and 
Counterparty Risk Management function reports into the CRO 
and also provides periodic reports related to market risk to the 
Board’s Finance Committee. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our Wholesale Banking businesses 
and to a lesser extent other divisions of the Company. Debt 
securities held for trading, equity securities held for trading, 
trading loans and trading derivatives are financial instruments 
used in our trading activities, and all are carried at fair value. 
Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities include net interest income, changes in fair value and 
realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our 
trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest 
expense components of our income statement. Changes in fair 
value of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are 
reflected in net gains on trading activities, a component of 
noninterest income in our income statement. For additional 
information on the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 4 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For additional information, including 
information regarding our monitoring activities, sensitivity 
analysis and stress testing, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section 
in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
balance sheet. 

Table 28 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. As presented in Table 28, average Company Trading 
General VaR was $153 million for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2020, compared with $155 million for the quarter 
ended June 30, 2020, and $24 million for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2019. The increase in average as well as period end 
Company Trading General VaR for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2020, compared with the quarter ended 
September 30, 2019, was driven by market volatility due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, in particular changes in interest rate curves 
and a significant widening of credit spreads entering the 12-
month historical lookback window used to calculate VaR.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by 
management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO 
and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these 
marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For 
additional information, see Note 8 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that make 
similar private equity investments. These private equity 
investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly and 
assesses them for possible other-than-temporary impairment 
(OTTI) and observable price changes. For nonmarketable equity 
securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of 
each individual investment and the expectations for that 
investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business 
model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are 
similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable 
equity securities include private equity investments accounted 
for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and 
the measurement alternative. 

In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was 
apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To 
manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 
through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of 
September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to 
compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a 
litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated 
with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained 
litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our 
balance sheet. For additional information about the associated

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING  The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan 
requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board establishes 
liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to 
cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-
dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These 
guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate 
ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are 
established and monitored for both the consolidated company 
and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the 
Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-taking 
banking subsidiaries. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that 
includes a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the 
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires banking 
institutions, such as Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets 
(HQLA), predominantly consisting of central bank deposits, 
government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of 
federal agencies that can be converted easily and quickly into 
cash, in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash 
outflows during a 30-day stress period. The rule is applicable to 
the Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured 
depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets greater than 
$10 billion. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced 
liquidity management standards on large BHCs such as 
Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have issued a rule implementing a 
stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding ratio 
(NSFR), which will require large banking organizations, including 
Wells Fargo, to maintain a sufficient amount of available stable 
funding, such as common equity, long-term subordinated debt 
and most types of deposits, in relation to their assets, derivative 
exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. The 
rule will become effective on July 1, 2021. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of September 30, 2020, the 
consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo

National Bank West were above the minimum LCR requirement 
of 100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net 
cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 29 
presents the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-
calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the 
LCR rule requirements.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity 
which are presented in Table 30. Our primary sources of liquidity 
are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR 
rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 
exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued by federal agencies 
within our debt securities portfolio. We believe these debt 
securities provide quick sources of liquidity through sales or by 
pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. 
Some of these debt securities are within our held-to-maturity 
portfolio and as such are not intended for sale, but may be 
pledged to obtain financing. Some of the legal entities within our 
consolidated group of companies are subject to various 
regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that can limit the 
transferability of their funds. We believe we maintain adequate 
liquidity for these entities in consideration of such funds transfer 
restrictions.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 30, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or available-for-sale 
debt securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or 
financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are 
not encumbered. As of September 30, 2020, we also maintained 
approximately $262.7 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 150% of total loans at 
September 30, 2020, and 137% at December 31, 2019. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-
term borrowings. Table 31 shows selected information for short-
term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days.

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Long-term debt of $215.7 billion at 

Table 32:  Maturity of Long-Term Debt 

September 30, 2020, decreased $12.5 billion from December 31, 
2019. We issued $237.1 million and $37.9 billion of long-term 
debt in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020, 
respectively. Depending on market conditions, we may purchase 
our outstanding debt securities from time to time in privately 
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or 
otherwise. Table 32 provides the aggregate carrying value of 
long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) 
for the remainder of 2020 and the following years thereafter, as 
of September 30, 2020.

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well 
as other market participants, generally will consider, among other 
factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment decisions. 
Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and 
qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset 
quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating 
agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of 
federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial 
institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a 
reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not 
contain credit rating covenants. 

On July 22, 2020, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings 
lowered the long-term rating of the Company to BBB+ from A-
and revised the rating outlook to stable from negative. On 

Table 33:  Credit Ratings as of September 30, 2020 

September 2, 2020, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed the 
Company’s ratings and revised the ratings outlook to negative 
from stable. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K for 

additional information regarding our credit ratings and the 
potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our 
liquidity and operations, as well as Note 15 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 

as of September 30, 2020, are presented in Table 33.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home Loan 
Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. Each member of the FHLBs 
is required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, potential future payments to the FHLBs are not 
determinable.

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements 
and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end of 2021. The 
Basel III capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including 
Wells Fargo. Our capital adequacy is assessed based on the lower 
of our risk-based capital ratios calculated under the 
Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach. The 
difference between RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced 
Approach has narrowed in recent quarters due to economic 
conditions from the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our 
calculation of Advanced Approach RWAs. In particular, changes 
in internal credit ratings in our loan portfolio contributed to an 
increase in our Advanced Approach RWAs at September 30, 
2020. We expect this trend to continue if the economic impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our customer 
base. 

Effective October 1, 2020, a stress capital buffer replaced 
the 2.50% capital conservation buffer under the Standardized 
Approach. The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the 
decrease in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely 
adverse scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and 
related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), 
plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. On 
August 10, 2020, the FRB announced that the Company's 
stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2020, through 
September 30, 2021, is 2.50%. Because the stress capital buffer 
is calculated annually as part of the FRB’s supervisory stress 
test and related CCAR and will be based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus the regulatory 
minimums for our risk-based capital ratios, are subject to 
change in future years. 

As a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule 
implementing the additional capital surcharge of between 
1.00-4.50% on the minimum capital requirements of G-SIBs. 
Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under 
two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The 
first method (method one) considers our size, 
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 
wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than the BCBS methodology. Because the G-SIB capital 
surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in 
future years. 

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. 
We primarily fund our working capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
September 30, 2020, decreased $5.8 billion from December 31, 
2019, predominantly as a result of common and preferred stock 
dividends of $5.6 billion. During third quarter 2020, we issued 
$325 million of common stock, excluding conversions of 
preferred shares. On September 30, 2020, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) announced that 
it was extending through fourth quarter 2020 measures it 
announced on June 25, 2020, prohibiting large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) subject to the FRB’s capital plan rule, including 
Wells Fargo, from making capital distributions, subject to certain 
limited exceptions. For additional information about capital 
planning, including the FRB’s recent prohibition on capital 
distributions, see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” and 
“Securities Repurchases” sections below. 

In January 2020, we issued $2.0 billion of our Preferred 
Stock, Series Z. In March 2020, we redeemed the remaining 
$1.8 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series K, and redeemed 
$669 million of our Preferred Stock, Series T. In October 2020, we 
issued $1.2 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series AA. For 
additional information, see Note 17 (Preferred Stock) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Guidelines 
The Company and each of our insured depository institutions 
(IDIs) are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based 
capital (RBC) guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating 
capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet 
exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, 
among other things, required on a fully phased-in basis as of 
September 30, 2020: 
• 

a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.00%, 
comprised of a 4.50% minimum requirement plus a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.50% and for us, as a global 
systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge of 
2.00%; 
a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.50%, comprised of a 
6.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a minimum total capital ratio of 12.50%, comprised of a 
8.00% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 
buffer of 2.50% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.00%; 
a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% to be 
added to the minimum risk-based capital ratios, which could 
be imposed by regulators at their discretion if it is 
determined that a period of excessive credit growth is 
contributing to an increase in systemic risk; and 
a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%.

Fully phased-in total capital amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and monitor 
the Company’s capital position. See Table 35 for information regarding the calculation and components of our fully phased-in total capital amounts, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP 
financial measures. 
RWAs and capital ratios for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule permits 
certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the ACL under CECL for each period until December 31, 
2021, followed by a three-year phase-out of the benefits. The impact of the CECL transition provision on our regulatory capital at September 30, 2020, was an increase in capital of $1.9 billion, 
reflecting a $991 million (post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $11.5 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 2020, through 
September 30, 2020. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, in each case with any excess 
allowance for credit losses being deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk 
categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 
Includes an increase of $1.5 billion under the Standardized Approach and a decrease of $1.3 billion under the Advanced Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on our excess 
allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2020. See footnote (3) to this table. 
Amounts for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible 
common equity ratios are as follows: 
• 

Tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding; and 

• 

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which 
represents our annualized earnings contribution as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. 

The methodology of determining tangible common equity 
may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible 
book value per common share and return on average tangible 
common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful 
financial measures because they enable investors and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 38 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  As a BHC, we are required to 
maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 5.00% 
(comprised of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our IDIs 
are required to maintain a SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered 
well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy 
guidelines. In April 2018, the FRB and OCC proposed rules 
(Proposed SLR rules) that would replace the 2.00% 
supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of 
our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR rules would 
similarly tailor the current 6.00% SLR requirement for our IDIs. In 
April 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule that temporarily 
allows a BHC to exclude on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. 
Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from 
the calculation of its total leverage exposure in the denominator 
of the SLR. This interim final rule became effective on April 1, 
2020, and expires on March 31, 2021. In May 2020, federal 
banking regulators issued an interim final rule that permits IDIs to 
choose to similarly exclude these items from the denominator of 
their SLRs; however, if an IDI chooses to exclude such amounts 
from the calculation of its SLR, it will be required to request 
approval from its primary federal banking regulator before 
making capital distributions, such as paying dividends, to its 
parent company. As of September 30, 2020, none of the 
Company’s IDIs elected to apply this exclusion. 

At September 30, 2020, our SLR for the Company was 
7.75%, and we also exceeded the applicable SLR requirements for 
each of our IDIs. See Table 39 for information regarding the 
calculation and components of the SLR.

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt 
for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as 
Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to 
have a minimum TLAC amount (consisting of CET1 capital and 
additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered 
BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) equal to the greater of 
(i) 18.00% of RWAs and (ii) 7.50% of total leverage exposure (the 
denominator of the SLR calculation). Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs are 
required to maintain (i) a TLAC buffer equal to 2.50% of RWAs 
plus our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under 

method one plus any applicable countercyclical buffer to be added 
to the 18.00% minimum and (ii) an external TLAC leverage buffer 
equal to 2.00% of total leverage exposure to be added to the 
7.50% minimum, in order to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. U.S. G-SIBs are 
also required to have a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 6.00% of RWAs plus our 
applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method two 
and (ii) 4.50% of the total leverage exposure. Under the Proposed 
SLR rules, the 2.00% external TLAC leverage buffer would be 
replaced with a buffer equal to one-half of our applicable G-SIB 
capital surcharge, and the leverage component for calculating the 
minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt would be 
modified from 4.50% of total leverage exposure to 2.50% of total 
leverage exposure plus one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital 
surcharge. As of September 30, 2020, our eligible external TLAC 
as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.76% 
compared with a required minimum of 22.00%. Similar to the risk-
based capital requirements, our minimum TLAC requirement is 
assessed based on the greater of RWAs determined under the 
Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  As 
discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report, federal banking regulators have issued a 
final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR 
and a proposed rule regarding the NSFR. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
based on the final Basel III capital rules under the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced Approaches CET1 capital ratios, we 
currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 
10.00%, which includes a 2.00% G-SIB capital surcharge. Our 
capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, 
including changes to the regulatory capital framework and 
expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory 
agencies, changes to the regulatory minimums for our capital 
ratios (including changes to our stress capital buffer), planned 
capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to 
submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB 
has any objections before making any capital distributions. The 
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material 
changes in a BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any 
significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses, among other things, 
the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of 
BHCs when evaluating capital plans. 

Our 2020 capital plan, which was submitted on April 3, 2020, 

as part of CCAR, included a comprehensive capital outlook 
supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of 
capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected 
and stress scenarios. As part of the 2020 CCAR, the FRB also 
generated a supervisory stress test, which assumed a sharp 
decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing 
using the information provided by the Company to estimate 
performance. The FRB reviewed the supervisory stress test

On September 30, 2020, the FRB announced that it was 

extending through fourth quarter 2020 measures it announced 
on June 25, 2020, prohibiting large BHCs subject to the FRB’s 
capital plan rule, including Wells Fargo, from making capital 
distributions, subject to certain limited exceptions that are 
described in the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section 
above. 

At September 30, 2020, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 167 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during third quarter 2020, see Part II, Item 2 in 
this Report. 

Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under 

the “safe harbor” conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 
limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all 
of the consideration. Our management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, including 
the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not 
there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. 

Capital Management (continued) 

results both as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a 
common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking 
into account the Company’s proposed capital actions. The FRB 
published its supervisory stress test results as required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act on June 25, 2020. 

On June 25, 2020, the FRB also announced that it was 
requiring large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to update and 
resubmit their capital plans within 45 days after the FRB provides 
updated scenarios. The FRB released the updated scenarios on 
September 17, 2020, and has announced that it will release BHC-
specific results under the updated scenarios by the end of 2020. 
On September 30, 2020, the FRB announced that it was 
extending through fourth quarter 2020 measures it announced 
on June 25, 2020, prohibiting large BHCs subject to the FRB's 
capital plan rule, including Wells Fargo, from making any capital 
distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the 
issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the 
numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise 
approved by the FRB. The FRB has generally authorized BHCs to 
(i) make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock 
related to employee stock ownership plans; (ii) provided that the 
BHC does not increase the amount of its common stock 
dividends, pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an 
amount equal to the average of the BHC’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters, unless otherwise specified by the 
FRB; and (iii) make scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and 
tier 2 capital instruments. These provisions may be extended by 
the FRB quarter-by-quarter. 

Concurrently with CCAR, federal banking regulators also 
require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to 
evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue 
to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial 
conditions. These stress testing requirements set forth the 
timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and banks 
must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls, 
oversight and disclosure requirements. We submitted the results 
of our stress test to the FRB and disclosed a summary of the 
results in June 2020. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future 
stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, 
including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block 
transactions, forward repurchase transactions, and similar 
transactions. Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase 
stock that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount of 
our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the 
number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans 
and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price of 
our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including the 
FRB’s response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk 
profile. Due to the various factors impacting the amount of our 
share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market 
regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital

In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued guidelines for banks 

and BHCs related to working with customers affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect to waiving 
fees, offering repayment accommodations, and providing 
payment deferrals. Any current or future rules, regulations, and 
guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts 
could require us to change certain of our business practices, 
reduce our revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us, 
or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or 
competitive position. 

Regulatory Matters 

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. 
financial services industry has been subject to a significant 
increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This 
increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how 
most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has 
increased their regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. The 
following supplements our discussion of the other significant 
regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected 
or may affect our business contained in the “Regulatory Matters” 
and “Risk Factors” sections in our 2019 Form 10-K and in our 
2020 First and Second Quarter Reports on Form 10-Q. 

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO COVID-19  In response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal banking 
regulators have undertaken a number of measures to help 
stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, and 
facilitate the ability of banking organizations like Wells Fargo to 
continue lending to consumers and businesses. For example, in 
order to facilitate the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security Act (CARES Act), federal banking regulators issued rules 
designed to encourage financial institutions to participate in 
stimulus measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s 
Paycheck Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending 
Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a number of lending 
facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the functioning of 
markets, including facilities covering money market mutual funds 
and term asset-backed securities loans. Federal banking 
regulators also issued several rules amending the regulatory 
capital and TLAC rules and other prudential regulations to ease 
certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage the 
use of certain FRB-established facilities in order to further 
promote lending to consumers and businesses.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2019 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses (ACL); 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; and 
liability for contingent litigation losses. 

Management and the Board’s Audit Committee have 
reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies. These 
policies are described further in the “Financial Review – Critical 
Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2019 Form 
10-K. In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 
2020, we have updated our critical accounting policy for the 
allowance for credit losses. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an ACL for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded 
credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans 
and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for 
sale. Additionally, we maintain an allowance for credit losses for 
debt securities classified as either held-to-maturity (HTM) or 
available-for-sale (AFS), other financial assets measured at 
amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-balance 
sheet credit exposures. In connection with our adoption of CECL, 
we updated our approach for estimating expected credit losses, 
which includes new areas for management judgment, described 
more fully below, and updated our accounting policies. For 
additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a 
discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the 
judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, and the length of 
the initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to 
time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business 
strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment 
strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in 
our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL 
to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security 
portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and 

58 

consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of 
the Company. 

•

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast 
period.  Forecasted economic variables, such as gross 
domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate or collateral 
asset prices, are used to estimate expected credit losses. 
While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the 
macro-economy level, some economic variables may be 
forecasted at more granular levels, for example, using the 
metro statistical area (MSA) level for unemployment rates, 
home prices and commercial real estate prices. Quarterly, we 
assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have 
currently set the period to one year. Management exercises 
judgment when assigning weight to the three economic 
scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses. The 
three scenarios include a most likely expectation of economic 
variables referred to as the base case scenario, as well as an 
optimistic (upside) scenario and a pessimistic (downside) 
scenario. 
Reversion of losses beyond the initial forecast period.  We use a 
reversion approach to connect the losses estimated for our 
initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical loss 
forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement 
date. Our reversion methodology considers the type of 
portfolio, point in the credit cycle, expected length of 
recessions and recoveries, as well as other relevant factors. 
The length of reversion period varies by asset type – one year 
for shorter contractual term loans such as commercial loans 
and two years for longer contractual term loans such as real 
estate 1-4 family mortgage loans. We assess the reversion 
approach on a quarterly basis and the length of the reversion 
period by asset type annually. 

•  Historical loss expectations.  At the end of the reversion 

• 

• 

period, we incorporate the changes in economic variables 
observed during representative historical time periods that 
include both recessions and expansions. This analysis is used 
to compute average losses for any given portfolio and its 
associated credit characteristics. Annually, we assess the 
historical time periods and ensure the average loss estimates 
are representative of our historical loss experience. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually 
assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit 
variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower quality 
ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial strength and 
contribute to forecasted probability of default curves. 
Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral 
prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted severity of 
loss in the event of default. These credit risk ratings are 
reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected 
to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. 
Management uses a combination of judgement and 
quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, 
modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the 
models. These models are validated in accordance with the 
Company’s policies by an internal model validation group. We 
routinely assess our model performance and apply 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s 

view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We 
applied 50% weight to both the base case scenario and the 
downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the 
potential for further economic deterioration from a COVID-19 
resurgence. The outcomes of both scenarios were influenced by 
the duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic 
variables within those scenarios. The sensitivity analysis resulted 
in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately 
$2.3 billion at September 30, 2020. The hypothetical increase in 
our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of 
management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the 
current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative 
effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar 
sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities 

given its size relative to the overall ACL. Management believes 
that the estimate for the ACL for loans was appropriate at the 
balance sheet date.

• 

adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss 
estimation. We also assess our models for limitations against 
the company-wide risk inventory to help ensure that we 
appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our 
estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as 
needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial 
asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply 
judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases 
in collateral valuation are included in the allowance for credit 
losses as a negative allowance when the financial asset has 
been previously written-down below current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We 
extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension 
options. We also incorporate into our allowance for credit 
losses any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide 
an extension through a TDR. 

•  Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions 
used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity  The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by 
management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based 
on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio 
credit quality, and general economic conditions. General 
economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, 
which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or 
portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, there 
are observed changes in economic variables such as the 
unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not

directions or differ across portfolios or geography.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 40 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 40:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description 

Effective date and financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 

The Update requires all features in long-duration insurance 
contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to 
be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair 
value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. Currently, two measurement models 
exist for these features, fair value and insurance accrual. The 
Update requires the use of a standardized discount rate and 
routine updates for insurance assumptions used in valuing the 
liability for future policy benefits for traditional long-duration 
contracts. The Update also simplifies the amortization of 
deferred acquisition costs. 

The guidance becomes effective on January 1, 2022. Certain of our variable annuity 
reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the 
associated insurance related reserves for these products to be measured at fair value 
as of the earliest period presented, with the cumulative effect on fair value for changes 
attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated 
other comprehensive income. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair 
value and carrying value, excluding the effect of our own credit, will be recognized in 
the opening balance of retained earnings. As of September 30, 2020, we held 
$1.2 billion in insurance-related reserves of which $583 million was in scope of the 
Update. A total of $531 million was associated with products that meet the definition 
of market risk benefits, and of this amount, $47 million was measured at fair value 
under current accounting standards. The market risk benefits are largely indexed to 
U.S. equity and fixed income markets. Upon adoption, we may incur periodic earnings 
volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the 
long duration of these contracts. We plan to economically hedge this volatility, where 
feasible. The ultimate impact of these changes will depend on the composition of our 
market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption. Changes in the accounting for 
the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and 
deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding long-duration contracts on 
the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period 
presented, and are not expected to be material. 

The following Updates are applicable to us but are not 
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements:

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future common 
stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of 
capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return on 
equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) expectations 
regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the outcome of 
contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s 
plans, objectives and strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts 

but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions 
regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. 
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they 
are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in 
circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may 
differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-
looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on 
any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither 
statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of 
future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of 
risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
those in the forward-looking statements include the following, 
without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our credit 
quality and business operations, as well as its impact on 
general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
financial services reform and other current, pending or future 
legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on 
our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act 
and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products 
and services;

developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability 
to attract and retain qualified employees, and our reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or 
infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other 
service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk 
Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 2019, as supplemented by the “Risk 
Factors” section in this Report. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common

stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), 
and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of 
Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or 
conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as 
supplemented by the “Risk Factors” section in this Report, as filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its 
website at www.sec.gov1. 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of 

the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause 
our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it 
is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no 
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Moreover, the pandemic has created additional operational

measures for our employees and customers, comply with rapidly 
changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of 
fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of 
our systems and networks as a larger number of our employees 
work remotely. The pandemic could also result in or contribute to 
additional downgrades to our credit ratings or credit outlook. In 
response to the pandemic, we have temporarily suspended 
certain mortgage foreclosure activities, and have provided fee 
waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for 
credit card, automobile, mortgage, small business, personal and 
commercial lending customers, and future governmental actions 
may require these and other types of customer-related 
responses. In addition, we have reduced our common stock 
dividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases, and we 
could take, or be required to take, other capital actions in the 
future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our 
business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as 
our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future 
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and 
actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties 
in response to the pandemic. 

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially 
and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could 
be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that 
could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the 
value of, and return on, an investment in the Company, we refer 
you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following risk factor supplements the “Risk Factors” 

section in our 2019 Form 10-K. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business 
and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on 
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic 
and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to 
the pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted 
the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, affected 
equity market valuations, created significant volatility and 
disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment 
levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in restrictions and 
closures for many businesses, as well as the institution of social 
distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states 
and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and 
services may continue to be significantly impacted, which could 
adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, the pandemic could 
continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan 
portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, 
particularly if businesses remain closed, the impact on the global 
economy worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of credit 
or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Similarly, 
because of changing economic and market conditions affecting 
issuers, we may be required to recognize further impairments on 
the securities we hold, as well as reductions in other 
comprehensive income. Moreover, the persistence of adverse 
economic conditions and reduced revenue may adversely affect 
the fair value of our operating segments and underlying reporting 
units which may result in the impairment of goodwill or other 
long-lived assets. Our business operations may be further 
disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to 
work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, 
government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the 
pandemic, and we have already temporarily closed certain of our 
branches and offices.

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2020, of the Company’s disclosure controls and 
procedures. The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the 
Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective as of September 30, 2020. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the 
Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
and includes those policies and procedures that: 
• 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

• 

• 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during third quarter 
2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
