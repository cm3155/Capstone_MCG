This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K).

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one 
in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses 
in the U.S., and is the leading middle market banking provider in 
the U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and 
mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance, through our four reportable operating 
segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, 
Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment 
Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 37 on Fortune’s 2021 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at September 30, 2021. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements to build the right foundation for all that lies ahead. 
The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or 
delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or 
delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on 
others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory 
action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, 
enforcement actions, and other negative consequences. While 
we still have significant work to do, the Company is committed to 
devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong 
business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of 
integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 

of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 
As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the 
extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from 
the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received 
by the Company from loans made in connection with these 
programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-
profit organizations approved by the FRB that support small 
businesses. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had not 
excluded these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of 
the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be 
conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the 
enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet 
satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we 
believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other 
enforcement actions. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a

Overview (continued) 

$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to 
insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s 
April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the 
Company’s Home Lending business. 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the 
execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party 
residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB consent 
order regarding retail sales practices expired. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2020 Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable 
and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust 
efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and 
information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with 
our regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For additional information, including related legal 
and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working 
diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry 
out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the 

public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help customers, 
employees and communities. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing 
forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans 
guaranteed under a program called the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). Since its inception, we have funded 
approximately 282,000 loans under the PPP totaling 
approximately $14.0 billion, and more than $8.8 billion of 
principal forgiveness has been provided on qualifying PPP loans. 
As of September 30, 2021, we had $4.7 billion of PPP loans 
outstanding. We voluntarily committed to donate all of the gross 
processing fees received from PPP loans funded in 2020 and 
have committed to donate any net profits from processing fees 
received from PPP loans funded in 2021. For additional 
information on the CARES Act and the PPP, see the “Overview – 
Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic” section in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely-
referenced benchmark rate, which is published in five currencies 
and a range of tenors, and seeks to estimate the cost at which 
banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On 
March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority and the 
administrator of LIBOR announced that LIBOR will no longer be 
published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, 
with the exception of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. 
dollar (USD) LIBOR which will no longer be published on a 
representative basis after June 30, 2023. Additionally, federal 
banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging 
banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a reference 
rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by 
December 31, 2021. We have made significant progress in 
preparation for the December 31, 2021, cessation date and in 
response to the regulatory guidance. 

We have continued to expand our product offerings using 

the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and other 
alternative reference rates for our commercial customers. We 
expect to have a suite of alternative reference rate products 
available for our customers prior to the end of 2021. In addition, 
we have continued the transition of interdealer derivative 
contracts to SOFR in accordance with the recommendation of 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Market Risk 
Advisory Committee. 

For additional information on the initiatives undertaken by 

our LIBOR Transition Office in an effort to mitigate the risks 
associated with a transition away from LIBOR, as well as the 
amount of our LIBOR-linked assets and liabilities, see the 
“Overview – Recent Developments – LIBOR Transition” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. For information regarding the risks and 
potential impact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial 
metric being significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see 
the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Actions and Restrictions 
In June 2021, the Company completed the 2021 Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test process. On 
August 5, 2021, the FRB confirmed that the Company's stress

In third quarter 2021, we generated $5.1 billion of net income 
and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.17, 
compared with net income of $3.2 billion and diluted EPS of 
$0.70 in the same period a year ago. Financial performance for 
third quarter 2021, compared with the same period a year ago, 
included the following: 
• 
• 

total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income; 
provision for credit losses decreased reflecting lower net 
charge-offs and improvements in the economic 
environment; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower restructuring 
charges, operating losses, and professional and outside 
services expense; 
average loans decreased due to lower residential mortgage 
loans driven by paydowns exceeding originations and the 
resecuritization of loans we purchased from Government 
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization 
pools, lower commercial loans driven by weak demand and a 
reduction of PPP loans outstanding, and the reclassification 
of student loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) included in 
other consumer loans; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in the 
Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, and 
Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating 
segments due to higher levels of liquidity and savings for 
consumer and commercial customers reflecting government 
stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the 
impact of payment deferral programs on consumer 
customers, partially offset by actions taken to manage under 
the asset cap which reduced deposits in the Corporate and 
Investment Banking operating segment and Corporate.

In the first nine months of 2021, we generated $15.8 billion 

of net income and diluted EPS of $3.57, compared with net 
income of $286 million and diluted loss per common share of 
$0.23 in the same period a year ago. Financial performance for 
the first nine months of 2021, compared with the same period a 
year ago, included the following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity 
securities, mortgage banking income, and investment 
advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset 
by lower net interest income; 
provision for credit losses decreased reflecting lower net 
charge-offs due to better portfolio credit quality driven by 
improvements in the economic environment; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses, professional and outside services expense, and 
restructuring charges, partially offset by higher incentive 
and revenue-related compensation in personnel expense; 
average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, weak 
demand for commercial loans, and the reclassification of 
student loans to LHFS included in other consumer loans; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in the 
Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, and 
WIM operating segments due to higher levels of liquidity 
and savings for consumer and commercial customers 
reflecting government stimulus programs and continued 
economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19

and the provision for credit losses in the first nine months of 
2021, compared with the same period a year ago, reflected 
improvements in current and forecasted economic 
conditions. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.70% at 
September 30, 2021, compared with 2.22% at December 31, 
2020. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $38 million, 
or 3 basis points of average commercial loans, in third 
quarter 2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$356 million, or 29 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, predominantly driven by lower losses and higher 
recoveries in our commercial and industrial portfolio 
primarily within the oil, gas and pipelines industry, and in the 
real estate mortgage portfolio. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $221 million, 
or 23 basis points of average consumer loans, in third 
quarter 2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$327 million, or 30 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, predominantly driven by lower losses in our credit card 
portfolio as a result of payment deferral activities and 
government stimulus programs instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $7.2 billion at 

September 30, 2021, decreased $1.7 billion, or 19%, from 
December 31, 2020, predominantly driven by our 
commercial and industrial portfolio reflecting improvements 
in the economic environment. NPAs represented 0.83% of 
total loans at September 30, 2021. 

securitization pools, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
this Report. The first nine months of 2021 decrease was due to 
the impact of lower interest rates and lower loan balances 
reflecting soft demand, elevated prepayments and refinancing 
activity, as well as unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting 
results and higher mortgage-backed securities premium 
amortization, partially offset by a lower cost of funding liabilities. 

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended September 30, 
2021 and 2020. 

For additional information about net interest income and 

net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net 
Interest Income” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Overview (continued) 

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in the first nine months 
of 2021, with total equity of $191.1 billion at September 30, 
2021, compared with $185.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Our 
liquidity and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at 
September 30, 2021, including: 
• 

our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 119%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%; 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.62%, which 
continued to exceed both the regulatory requirement of 9% 
and our current internal target; and 
our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.68%, 
compared with the regulatory requirement of 21.50%. 

• 

• 

See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the improving economic environment. 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$14.7 billion at September 30, 2021, decreased $5.0 billion 
from December 31, 2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(3.7) billion in 

the first nine months of 2021, down from $14.1 billion in the 
same period a year ago. The decrease in the ACL for loans 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for third quarter 2021 was $5.1 billion 
($1.17 diluted EPS), compared with $3.2 billion ($0.70 diluted 
EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income increased in third 
quarter 2021, compared with the same period a year ago, 
predominantly due to a $2.2 billion decrease in provision for 
credit losses, and a $1.9 billion decrease in noninterest expense, 
partially offset by a $1.6 billion increase in income tax expense 
and a $470 million decrease in net interest income. 

Net income for the first nine months of 2021 was 

$15.8 billion ($3.57 diluted EPS), compared with $286 million 
($0.23 diluted loss per common share) in the same period a year 
ago. Net income increased in the first nine months of 2021, 
compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to 
a $18.0 billion decrease in provision for credit losses, a 
$5.9 billion increase in noninterest income, and a $2.2 billion 
decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $5.6 billion 
increase in income tax expense and a $4.1 billion decrease in net 
interest income. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in both 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, compared with 
the same periods a year ago. The third quarter 2021 decrease 
was due to the impact of lower loan balances reflecting soft 
demand and elevated prepayments, and the impact of lower 
yields on earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in long-
term debt and lower mortgage-backed securities premium 
amortization. Third quarter 2021 included interest income from 
PPP loans of $117 million. Additionally, in third quarter 2021, we 
had interest income associated with loans we purchased from 
GNMA loan securitization pools of $212 million. For additional 
information about loans purchased from GNMA loan

Deposit-related fees increased driven by: 
• 

higher consumer transaction volumes compared with a third 
quarter 2020 that included reduced volumes due to the 
economic slowdown associated with the COVID-19 
pandemic; 
lower fee waivers and reversals compared with a third 
quarter 2020 that included elevated fee waivers due to our 
actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by an increase in transaction service volumes and 
repricing. 

• 

• 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees increased 
reflecting higher market valuations on client investment assets. 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” and “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Corporate – Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) 
Assets Under Management” sections in this Report. 

Investment banking fees increased driven by higher loan 
syndication fees, advisory fees, and equity underwriting fees. 

Card fees increased reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction volumes. 

Net servicing income decreased predominantly due to lower 
income from mortgage servicing right (MSR) valuation changes 
and related hedges driven by more favorable valuation 
adjustments in third quarter 2020 due to improving economic 
conditions. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
• 

lower residential real estate held for sale (HFS) origination 
volumes and margins in our retail and correspondent 
production channels; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020. 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities decreased driven by: 
• 

lower gains on equity products compared with a third 
quarter 2020 that reflected higher volumes and customer 
activity due to volatility in the equities markets; 
lower client trading activity for credit products due to 
widening credit spreads; and 
lower asset-backed finance client trading activity due to a 
decline in demand for commercial mortgage-backed 
securities (CMBS) and residential mortgage-backed 
securities (RMBS) products. 

• 

• 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities increased due to 
higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities from 
our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. 

Other income decreased due to lower equity method investment 
income compared with a third quarter 2020 that included 
$228 million of equity method investment income related to a 
change in the accounting measurement model for certain 
nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Lending-related fees increased reflecting higher loan 
commitment fees. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees increased 
reflecting higher market valuations on client investment assets. 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” and “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Corporate – Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) 
Assets Under Management” sections in this Report. 

Investment banking fees increased driven by higher loan 
syndication fees, advisory fees, and equity underwriting fees. 

Card fees increased reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction volumes. 

Net servicing income increased reflecting negative MSR 
valuation adjustments in the first nine months of 2020 for higher 
expected servicing costs and higher prepayment estimates due 
to changes in economic conditions that improved in 2021. 

• 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales increased 
driven by: 
• 
• 

a higher production margin in our retail production channel; 
higher gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020; and 
losses in the first nine months of 2020 driven by the impact 
of interest rate volatility on hedging activities associated 
with our residential mortgage loans held for sale portfolio 
and pipeline, as well as valuation losses on certain residential 
and commercial loans held for sale due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on market conditions. 

Net gains from trading activities decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower client trading activity for interest rate products, 
equities, and commodities; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher client trading activity for asset-backed finance 
products. 

Net gains on debt securities decreased primarily due to lower 
gains on sales of agency MBS and municipal bonds. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities increased driven by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
from our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; 
higher realized gains on the sales of equity securities; 
higher gains on deferred compensation plan investments 
(largely offset in personnel expense). Refer to Table 3a for 
the results for our deferred compensation plan and related 
hedges; and 
lower impairment of equity securities due to the market 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in first quarter 2020. 

• 
• 

• 

Other income decreased due to: 
• 

lower gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans which 
were reclassified to held for sale in 2019; and 
higher valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk, 
including the timing and amount of final settlement, 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we previously sold. For additional information, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – 
Equity Securities” section in our 2020 Form 10-K; and 
lower income from investments accounted for under the 
equity method; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

a gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio. 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

higher incentive compensation expense; and 
higher revenue-related compensation expense; 

Personnel expense increased driven by: 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower salaries as a result of reduced headcount. 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
decreased due to lower expense for contracts related to 
telecommunications, hardware, and maintenance. 

Occupancy expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

lower rent expense; and 
lower cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expenses 
compared with a third quarter 2020 that included higher 
expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
customer remediation accruals and litigation accruals, partially 
offset by a $250 million operating loss associated with the 
September 2021 OCC enforcement action. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors.

information on restructuring charges, see Note 19 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Personnel expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense, including the 
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based 
compensation; 
higher revenue-related compensation expense; and 
higher deferred compensation expense; 

• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower salaries as a result of reduced headcount. 

Table 3a presents results for our deferred compensation 
plan and related hedges. In second quarter 2020, we entered into 
arrangements to transition our economic hedges of the deferred 
compensation plan liabilities from equity securities to derivative 
instruments. As a result of this transition, changes in fair value of 
derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred 
compensation plan are reported in personnel expense rather than 
in net gains (losses) from equity securities within noninterest 
income. For additional information on the derivatives used in the 
economic hedges, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was $1.5 billion in third quarter 2021, 
compared with an income tax benefit of $83 million in the same 
period a year ago. The effective income tax rate was 22.9% for 
third quarter 2021, compared with (2.6)% for the same period a 
year ago. 

Income tax expense was $3.9 billion in the first nine months 

of 2021, compared with an income tax benefit of $1.7 billion in 
the same period a year ago. The effective income tax rate was 
19.7% for the first nine months of 2021, compared with 119.8% 
for the same period a year ago. 

The increase in our income tax expense for both the third 

quarter and first nine months of 2021, compared with the same 
periods a year ago, was driven by higher pre-tax income. In 
addition, the third quarter and first nine months of 2020 included 
net discrete income tax benefits primarily related to the 
resolution and reevaluation of prior period matters with U.S. 
federal and state tax authorities. 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for technology contracts and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in second 
quarter 2020. 

Occupancy expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

lower rent expense; and 
lower cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expenses 
compared with a first nine months of 2020 that included 
higher expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
customer remediation accruals and litigation accruals, partially 
offset by a $250 million operating loss associated with the 
September 2021 OCC enforcement action. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Leases expense decreased reflecting a reduction in the size of 
the operating lease asset portfolio. 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by a 
continued reduction in marketing and brand campaign volumes 
due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Restructuring charges decreased due to lower personnel-
related charges related to our efficiency initiatives that began in 
third quarter 2020. For additional information on restructuring 
charges, see Note 19 (Restructuring Charges) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Other expenses increased driven by: 
• 

a write-down of goodwill in the first nine months of 2021 
related to the sale of our student loan portfolio; and 
higher charitable donations expense driven by the donation 
of PPP processing fees; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 4. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income 
from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 

Table 4:  Management Reporting Structure 

business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

Third quarter 2021 vs. third quarter 2020 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
HFS origination volumes and margins, as well as lower 
income from MSR valuation changes and related hedges, 
partially offset by higher gains related to the resecuritization 
of loans we purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools 
in 2020; and 
lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances, partially offset by 
higher deposit balances; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher card fees reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction 
volumes; and 
higher deposit-related fees driven by higher consumer 
transaction volumes compared with a third quarter 2020 
that included reduced volumes due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
lower fee waivers and reversals compared with a third

quarter 2020 that included elevated fee waivers due to our 
actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; 
lower personnel expense driven by lower branch staffing 
expense related to efficiency initiatives in Consumer and 
Small Business Banking; 
lower occupancy expense related to lower cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses compared with a third 
quarter 2020 that included higher expenses due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic; and 
lower advertising and promotion expense.

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Revenue increased driven by:
•

•

higher mortgage banking noninterest income due to a 
higher production margin in our retail production channel, 
higher gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020, and 
losses in the first nine months of 2020 driven by the impact 
of interest rate volatility on hedging activities and valuation 
losses due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
market conditions; and
higher card fees reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction 
volumes; 
partially offset by:
•

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances, partially offset by 
higher deposit balances; and
lower other income driven by lower gains on the sales of 
residential mortgage loans which were reclassified to held 
for sale in 2019.

•

Noninterest expense decreased driven by:
•

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; 
lower personnel expense reflecting additional payments 
made in the first nine months of 2020 to certain customer-
facing and support employees and for back-up child care 
services, as well as lower branch staffing expense in the first 
nine months of 2021 related to efficiency initiatives in 
Consumer and Small Business Banking, partially offset by 
higher revenue-related compensation in Home Lending; 
lower advertising and promotion expense; and
lower occupancy expense related to lower cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses compared with a first nine 
months of 2020 that included higher expenses due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic;

•

•
•

partially offset by:
•

higher charitable donations expense driven by the donation 
of PPP processing fees.

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment.

Third quarter 2021 vs. third quarter 2020 

Total loans (average) decreased as paydowns exceeded 
originations. Home Lending loan balances were also impacted by 
actions taken to temporarily curtail certain non-conforming 
residential mortgage originations and suspend home equity 
originations, as well as the resecuritization of loans we purchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools. Small Business loan 
balances were also impacted by a decline in PPP loans.

Total deposits (average) increased driven by higher levels of 
liquidity and savings for consumer customers reflecting 
government stimulus programs and payment deferral programs, 

as well as continued economic uncertainty associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower spending related to efficiency initiatives, including 
lower personnel expense from reduced headcount; 
lower lease expense reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio; 
lower professional and outside services expense reflecting 
decreased project-related expense; 
lower occupancy expense; and 
lower expenses allocated from enterprise functions, 
including lower technology expenses. 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances and 
the lower interest rate environment; and 
lower lease income reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 
• 

higher income from renewable energy investments; and 
higher deposit-related fees due to higher treasury 
management fees, driven by an increase in transaction 
service volumes and repricing. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment.

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment.

Revenue decreased driven by:
•

lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances and 
the lower interest rate environment; and
lower lease income reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio;

partially offset by:
•

higher other noninterest income due to gains on equity 
securities and higher income from renewable energy 
investments; and
higher deposit-related fees due to higher treasury 
management fees, driven by a lower earnings credit rate due 
to the lower interest rate environment and repricing.

•

•

Noninterest expense decreased driven by:
•

lower spending related to efficiency initiatives, including 
lower personnel expense from reduced headcount;
lower lease expense reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio; and
lower professional and outside services expense reflecting 
decreased project-related expense; 

•

•

partially offset by:
•

higher expenses due to lower allocations of shared expenses 
with other lines of business.

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher loan balances 
and higher trading assets, partially offset by lower deposit 
balances and margins; 
higher investment banking fees due to higher loan 
syndication fees, advisory fees, and equity underwriting fees; 
and 
higher other noninterest income due to higher gains from 
equity securities and higher mortgage banking income 

•

related to higher servicing income and higher gains on the 
sales of mortgage loans; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net gains from trading activities due to lower gains on 
equity products compared with a third quarter 2020 that 
reflected higher volumes and customer activity due to 
volatility in the equities markets, lower client trading activity

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; 
lower expenses allocated from enterprise functions 
reflecting lower spending due to efficiency initiatives; 
lower professional and outside services expense reflecting 
decreased project-related expense; and 
a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

•

partially offset by: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher incentive 
compensation.

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net gains from trading activities driven by lower client 
trading activity for interest rate products, equities, and 
commodities, partially offset by higher client trading activity 
for asset-backed finance products; and 
lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, lower deposit balances, and lower average 
trading-related assets; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher investment banking fees due to higher loan 
syndication fees, advisory fees, and equity underwriting fees; 
higher other noninterest income driven by higher mortgage 
banking income due to higher servicing income and gains on 
the sales of mortgage loans, as well as higher income from 
low income housing investments; and 
higher lending-related fees reflecting increased loan 
commitment fees.

higher investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to higher market valuations on WIM advisory assets; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel expense 
driven by higher revenue-related compensation. 

Total loans (average) increased primarily due to higher 
securities-based lending balances.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

higher investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to higher market valuations on WIM advisory assets; and 
higher deferred compensation plan investment results 
included in other noninterest income (largely offset by 
personnel expense); 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation and higher deferred compensation expense; 
and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in the first 
nine months of 2020; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower professional and outside services expense driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants 
and contractors. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased primarily due 
to growth in customer balances in both The Private Bank and 
Wells Fargo Advisors. 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 5h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business for the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2021 and 2020. Management believes that 
advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, 
investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts 
may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. 

For third quarter 2021 and 2020, the average fee rate by 

account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

NM – Not meaningful

(2) 

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 
Beginning in first quarter 2021, employees who were notified of displacement remained as headcount in their respective operating segment rather than included in Corporate. 

Third quarter 2021 vs. third quarter 2020 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower equity method investment income compared with a 
third quarter 2020 that included $228 million of equity 
method investment income related to a change in the 
accounting measurement model for certain nonmarketable 
equity securities from our affiliated venture capital business; 
lower net interest income driven by lower loan balances; and 
lower gains on debt securities in our investment portfolio; 

• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher realized and unrealized gains on securities in our 
affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. 

lower restructuring charges; 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense; and 
higher operating losses driven by a $250 million operating 
loss associated with the September 2021 OCC enforcement 
action. 

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
in our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses, higher realized gains on the sales of equity 
securities, as well as impairment of equity securities in first 
quarter 2020 due to the market impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic; 

• 

• 

higher gains on deferred compensation plan investments 
(largely offset by personnel expense); and 
a gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio and a modest 
gain on the sale of our Canadian equipment finance business; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting 
results, and lower loan balances; 
higher valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk, 
including the timing and amount of final settlement, 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we previously sold; and 
lower gains on debt securities in our investment portfolio. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment and lower provision associated with the 
sale of our student loan portfolio. 

lower restructuring charges; 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense, including the 
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based 
compensation; 
higher deferred compensation expense; and 
a write-down of goodwill in 2021 related to the sale of our 
student loan portfolio. 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets (as a lessor) of $5.4 billion, 
which was net of $1.9 billion of accumulated depreciation, as of

Earnings Performance (continued) 

September 30, 2021. The average age of our rail cars is 21 years 
and the rail cars are typically leased under short-term leases of 
3 to 5 years. Our three largest concentrations, which represented 
55% of our rail car fleet as of September 30, 2021, were rail cars 
used for the transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and 
cement/sand products. Impairment may result in the future 
based on changing economic and market conditions affecting the 
long-term demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our 
assumptions for impairment are sensitive to estimated 
utilization and rental rates, as well as the estimated economic life 
of the leased asset. For additional information on the accounting 

for impairment of operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

In addition, Corporate includes assets under management 
(AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional 
Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets of $20 billion and 
$565 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2021, which we 
continue to administer at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a 
transition services agreement. The transition services agreement 
terminates in February 2022.

Third quarter 2021 vs. third quarter 2020 

First nine months of 2021 vs. first nine months of 2020 

Total assets (average) increased due to: 
• 

an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
managed by corporate treasury as a result of an increase in 
deposits from the reportable operating segments; 
an increase in held-to-maturity debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; and 
an increase in equity securities related to our affiliated 
venture capital business; 

partially offset by: 
• 

a decline in available-for-sale debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; and 
a decline in loans due to the sale of our student loan 
portfolio.

Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) Assets Under 
Management  We earn investment advisory and other asset-
based fees from managing and administering assets through 
WFAM, which offers Wells Fargo proprietary mutual funds and 
manages institutional separate accounts. Generally, we earn fees 
from AUM where we have discretionary management authority 
over the investments and generate fees as a percentage of the 
market value of the AUM. WFAM assets under management 
consist of equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money 

Table 5k:  WFAM Assets Under Management 

market, and stable value, and include client assets that are 
managed or sub-advised on behalf of other Wells Fargo lines of 
business. Table 5k presents WFAM AUM activity for the third 
quarter and first nine months of 2021 and 2020. Management 
believes that AUM is a useful metric because it allows 
management, investors, and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $21 million and $28 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $75 million and $41 million related to 
held-to-maturity debt securities at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 6 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in 
available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K for information on our investment management objectives 
and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for information on liquidity 
and interest rate risk. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities increased from December 31, 
2020. Purchases of AFS debt securities were partially offset by 
runoff and sales. Purchases of HTM debt securities, including 
securitizations of LHFS, were partially offset by runoff. In 
addition, we transferred $41.3 billion of AFS debt securities to 
HTM debt securities in the first nine months of 2021 due to 
actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital 
management purposes. 

The total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt 
securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher 
interest rates. 

At September 30, 2021, 96% of the combined AFS and HTM 

debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are 

based on external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-
for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and 
HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by 
security type.

Table 7 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased compared with 
December 31, 2020, predominantly due to an increase in the 
commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan 
demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, 
partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness. Consumer 
loans decreased from December 31, 2020, predominantly driven 
by a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due 
to loan paydowns as a result of the low interest rate environment 
and the transfer of $13.5 billion of first lien mortgage loans to 
loans held for sale (LHFS) substantially all of which related to the 
sales of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 
prior periods, partially offset by originations of $51.3 billion.

Deposits 
Deposits increased from December 31, 2020, reflecting: 
• 

higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer 
customers reflecting government stimulus programs and 
payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic 
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; 

partially offset by: 
• 

actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in 
declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of 

deposit (CDs), and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. 
offices. 

Table 8 provides additional information regarding deposits. 

Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest 
income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided 
in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” section and

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity 
securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, 
derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are 
designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) 
manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify 
our funding sources. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, 
we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 11 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 11 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. For additional information about how we 
manage risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K. The discussion that follows supplements our 
discussion of the management of certain risks contained in the 
“Risk Management” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part of 
IRM, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk 
reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to 
credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit 
Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio 
Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on 
our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk. 
Table 9 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio 
segment and class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Reputation risk. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in third quarter 2021 
reflected continued improvement in the economic environment. 
In particular: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $7.0 billion at September 30, 2021, 
down from $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans decreased to $3.0 billion at September 30, 
2021, compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans increased slightly to $4.0 billion 
at September 30, 2021, compared with $3.9 billion at 
December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.82% of 
total loans at September 30, 2021, compared with 0.98% at 
December 31, 2020. 

•  Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of our average 

commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 0.03% and 
0.23% in the third quarter and 0.07% and 0.31% in the first 
nine months of 2021, respectively, compared with 0.29% 
and 0.30% in the third quarter and 0.33% and 0.44% in the 
first nine months of 2020. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were 
$121 million and $394 million in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, at September 30, 2021, 
compared with $78 million and $612 million at 
December 31, 2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(1.4) billion and 
$(3.7) billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2021, respectively, compared with $751 million and 
$14.1 billion for the same periods a year ago. 
The ACL for loans decreased to $14.7 billion, or 1.70% of 
total loans, at September 30, 2021, compared with 
$19.7 billion, or 2.22%, at December 31, 2020.

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations  During 2020, we 
provided accommodations to customers in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals, and other 
expanded assistance for mortgage, credit card, auto, small 
business, personal and commercial lending customers. With the 
exception of residential mortgage-related accommodation 
programs, the COVID-related lending accommodations 
instituted during 2020 were no longer offered as of 
December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage accommodation 
programs, which continued during the first nine months of 2021, 
offered payment deferrals for up to a total of 18 months. 
Table 10 summarizes the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of 
consumer loans that received accommodations under loan 
modification programs established to assist customers with the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-related 
modifications) and that remained in a deferral period as of 
September 30, 2021. 

Based on guidance in the CARES Act and the Interagency 

Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial

(Revised) issued by federal banking regulators in April 2020 (the 
Interagency Statement), both of which we elected to apply, loan 
modifications related to COVID-19 and that meet certain other 
criteria are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) 
classification. Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief 
provided by the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement 
impacts our regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications

related to COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting 
normally required with TDR classification. At September 30, 
2021, substantially all residential mortgage loans that were in a 
deferral period, excluding those that were government insured/ 
guaranteed, met the criteria for TDR relief and were therefore 
not classified as TDRs. For additional information regarding the 
TDR relief provided by the CARES Act and the clarifying TDR 
accounting guidance from the Interagency Statement, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual status 
for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past 
due or nonaccrual status. Customer loans that are not further 
modified upon exit from the deferral period may be placed on 
nonaccrual status or charged-off in accordance with our policies 
if customers are unable to resume making payments in 
accordance with the contractual terms of their agreement. As of 
September 30, 2021, substantially all of our consumer loans were 
current after exiting the deferral period. For additional 
information about our COVID-related modifications, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related 
Lending Accommodations” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K.

Represents the UPB of loans that exited the deferral period and had a balance that was less than 30 days past due as of September 30, 2021. 
For residential mortgage loans still in active COVID-related accommodation programs as of September 30, 2021, 97% of first lien and 89% of junior lien mortgage loans had a loan-to-value ratio that 
was 80% or lower. 
Includes credit card, auto, and other consumer loans (including personal lines/loans). 
Represents residential mortgage – first lien loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that were primarily repurchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools. For additional information on GNMA loan securitization pools, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” 
section in this Report. FHA/VA loans are entitled to payment deferrals of scheduled principal and interest up to a total of 18 months. 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 

generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $13.5 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at September 30, 2021, 
compared with $19.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The change 
was driven by decreases in the oil, gas and pipelines, retail, 
transportation services, and entertainment and recreation 
industries, as these industries continue to recover from the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio increased at September 30, 2021, compared 

with December 31, 2020, driven by higher loan demand resulting 

Table 11:  Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing by Industry 

in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by 
paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness. Table 11 provides our 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry. 
The industry categories are based on the North American 
Industry Classification System.

(2)  No other single industry had total loans in excess of $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 

concentration, is predominantly comprised of loans to 
investment firms, financial vehicles, and nonbank creditors. We 
had $94.7 billion and $80.0 billion of loans originated by our 
Asset Backed Finance (ABF) and Financial Institution Group (FIG) 
lines of business at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 
2020, respectively. These loans include: (i) loans to customers 
related to their subscription or capital calls, (ii) loans to nonbank 
lenders collateralized by commercial loans, and (iii) loans to 
originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by 
residential real estate or other consumer loans such as credit 
cards, auto loans and leases, student loans and other financial 
assets eligible for the securitization market. These ABF and FIG 
loans are limited to a percentage of the value of the underlying 
financial assets considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, 
and ongoing performance. These ABF and FIG loans may also 
have other features to manage credit risk such as cross-
collateralization, credit enhancements, and contractual re-
margining of collateral supporting the loans. In addition, loans to 
financials except banks included collateralized loan obligations 
(CLOs) in loan form, all of which were rated AA or above, of 
$7.7 billion and $7.9 billion at September 30, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $6.1 billion and 

$7.5 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at September 30, 
2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Oil, gas and 

pipelines nonaccrual loans decreased at September 30, 2021, 
compared with December 31, 2020, driven by loan paydowns. 
We continue to perform escalated credit monitoring for 

certain industries that we consider to be directly and 
most adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio also includes non-U.S. loans of $74.7 billion and 
$63.8 billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. 
loans at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively, included: 
• 

$45.6 billion and $36.2 billion in the financials except banks 
category; 
$15.2 billion and $12.8 billion in the banks category; and 
$1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines 
category.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory 
definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized 
segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and 
loss categories. We had $15.2 billion of CRE mortgage loans 
classified as criticized at September 30, 2021, compared with 
$12.0 billion at December 31, 2020, and $2.3 billion of CRE 
construction loans classified as criticized at September 30, 2021,

compared with $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase 
in criticized CRE mortgage and construction loans was driven by 
the hotel/motel, apartment, institutional, and office property 
types and reflected the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Due to uncertainty in the recovery from the economic 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit quality of certain 
property types within our CRE loan portfolio, such as retail, hotel/ 
motel, office buildings, and shopping centers, could continue to 
be adversely affected. 

The total CRE loan portfolio decreased $411 million from 
December 31, 2020, driven by a decrease in CRE construction 

loans predominantly related to hotel/motel and apartments 
property types, partially offset by an increase in CRE mortgage 
loans. The CRE loan portfolio included $8.5 billion of non-U.S. 
CRE loans at September 30, 2021. The portfolio is diversified 
both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic 
concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida 
and Texas, which combined represented 49% of the total CRE 
portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are office 
buildings at 25% and apartments at 20% of the portfolio.

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At September 30, 2021, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$83.2 billion, representing approximately 10% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $72.9 billion, or 
approximately 8% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at 
December 31, 2020. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of 
our total consolidated assets at both September 30, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 

based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which 
gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

September 30, 2021, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$36.4 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $9.7 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $51.4 billion exposure to financial institutions and $43.0 billion to non-financial corporations at September 30, 2021. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 93% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at September 30, 
2021, compared with 92% at December 31, 2020. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both September 30, 2021, 
and December 31, 2020. We believe our origination process 
appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
reset risk across our residential mortgage loans and our ACL for 
loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM products, 
nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed 
payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial 
services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It 
is not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, 
interest-only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and 
similar features. Junior lien loan products are primarily 
amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and 
repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously 
monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – 
junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the 
frequency and severity of losses, such as junior lien performance 
when the first lien loan is delinquent. 

Our residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior 

lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with 
variable interest rate and payment options available during the 
draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding 
principal balance plus accrued interest. As of September 30, 
2021, lines of credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-
only option. The lines that enter their amortization period may 
experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased risk in our ACL estimate. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 
increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

In anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit 
borrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we 
have created a program to inform, educate and help these 
borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing

borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our 
ongoing program strategy. 

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of 
this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change 
in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated 
valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. Additional 
information about appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for their use 
can be found in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage 
Loans” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and 
junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit 
line products) to property collateral value. Excluding government 
insured/guaranteed loans, these credit risk indicators on the 
residential mortgage portfolio were: 
• 

Loans 30 days or more delinquent at September 30, 2021, 
totaled $3.5 billion, or 1% of residential mortgage loans, 
compared with $4.7 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020; 
Lines of credit in their draw period that were 30 days or 
more past due were $329 million, or 2% of such lines, at 
September 30, 2021, and $381 million, or 2%, at 
December 31, 2020, compared with amortizing lines of 
credit that were 30 days or more past due of $337 million, or 
6% of such lines, at September 30, 2021, and $378 million, 
or 5%, at December 31, 2020; 
Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 totaled $4.1 billion, 
or 2% of residential mortgage loans, at September 30, 2021, 
compared with $5.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020; 
and 
Loans with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 
$583 million at September 30, 2021, or less than 1% of 
residential mortgage loans, compared with $1.6 billion, or 
1%, at December 31, 2020. 

• 

• 

• 

With respect to residential mortgage – junior lien loans that had a 
CLTV greater than 100%: 
• 

Such loans totaled 2% of the junior lien portfolio at 
September 30, 2021, compared with 3% at December 31, 
2020; and 
3% were 30 days or more delinquent at both September 30, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. 

• 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of delinquencies. For additional information 
regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 4 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For additional information on our modification 
programs, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 
For additional information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in this 
Report. 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $33.7 billion from 
December 31, 2020, driven by loan paydowns as a result of the 
low interest rate environment and the transfer of $13.5 billion of 
first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) 
substantially all of which related to the sales of loans purchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods, partially 
offset by originations of $51.3 billion.

Consists of 45 states; no state in Other had loans in excess of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of 
credit was $24.5 billion at September 30, 2021. The unfunded 
credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $47.9 billion 
at September 30, 2021. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 

of borrowers in our residential mortgage – first and junior lien 
lines of credit portfolios. In September 2021, excluding 
borrowers with COVID-related loan modification payment 
deferrals: 
• 

Approximately 44% of these borrowers paid only the 
minimum amount due and approximately 51% paid more 
than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 
delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. 
For the borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, 
approximately 29% paid only the minimum amount due and 
approximately 66% paid more than the minimum amount 
due. 

• 

Credit Card  Our credit card portfolio totaled $36.1 billion at 
September 30, 2021, compared with $36.7 billion at 
December 31, 2020. 

Auto  Our auto portfolio totaled $53.8 billion at September 30, 
2021, compared with $48.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The 
increase in the outstanding balance at September 30, 2021, 
compared with December 31, 2020, was driven by strong 
consumer demand for automobiles. 

Other Consumer  Other consumer loans, which include revolving 
credit and installment loans, totaled $27.0 billion at 
September 30, 2021, compared with $24.4 billion at 
December 31, 2020, driven by an increase in margin loans.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  For information about when we generally place loans on 
nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 
10-K. Customer payment deferral activities instituted in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of nonaccrual loans for those customers who would 
have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For additional

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on foreclosed assets, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $1.8 billion from 

December 31, 2020, predominantly due to a decline in 
commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans, driven by a decrease 
in oil, gas, and pipeline nonaccrual loans, primarily as a result of 
paydowns. For additional information on commercial and 
industrial nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 
Financing” section in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans increased $89 million from 
December 31, 2020, predominantly driven by an increase in 
residential mortgage – first lien nonaccrual loans as customers 
exited from accommodation programs provided in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers requiring further payment 
assistance after exiting from these programs may have been 
modified or may be eligible to receive modifications.

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans

We believe exposure to loss on nonaccrual loans is mitigated 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing financial 

difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan modification. 
Under our proprietary modification programs, customers may be 
required to provide updated documentation, and some programs 
require completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate 
sustained performance before the loan can be removed from 
nonaccrual status. 

by the following factors at September 30, 2021: 
• 

96% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 94% are secured by real estate and 95% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
77% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 75% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain. 
of the $1.0 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$685 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered in developing our allowance for loan losses.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed autos. 

Foreclosed assets at September 30, 2021, included 

$47 million of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 33% is 
predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining amount of 
foreclosed assets has been written down to estimated net 
realizable value. Of the $121 million in foreclosed assets at 
September 30, 2021, 66% have been in the foreclosed assets 
portfolio for one year or less. 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended certain 
mortgage foreclosure activities, which has affected the amount 
of our foreclosed assets. For additional information on loans in 
process of foreclosure, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 20 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2020, 
predominantly related to commercial and industrial loans and 
residential mortgage – first lien loans. The decrease in 
commercial and industrial loans was primarily due to paydowns in 
the oil, gas, and pipelines industry. The decrease in residential 

mortgage – first lien loans was due to paydowns and a 
$773 million transfer from residential mortgage – first lien loans 
to LHFS, substantially all of which related to the sales of loans 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020. The 
amount of our TDRs at September 30, 2021, would have 
otherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the 
CARES Act and Interagency Statement.

In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire 
amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we 
delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal 
(principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance 
if that amount is not considered fully collectible. The allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs was $301 million and $565 million at 
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. As 
part of our actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we have provided borrowers relief in the form of loan 
modifications. Under the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, loan modifications related to the COVID-19 
pandemic will not be classified as TDRs if they meet certain 
eligibility criteria. For additional information on the CARES Act 

and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality Overview – COVID-
Related Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 
For information on our nonaccrual policies when a 

restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Table 21 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 

(2)  Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held for sale. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market terms 

qualify as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 

(3)  Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 

modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 
90 days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) residential 
mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory 
rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, 
usually 120 days past due.

Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding 
government insured/guaranteed loans, at September 30, 2021, 
were down from December 31, 2020, due to decreases in 
delinquent consumer loans driven by strong payment 
performance, partially offset by increases in delinquent 
commercial real estate mortgage loans. Customer payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies for customers who would have otherwise moved 
into past due status. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 
repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA for mortgages at September 30, 2021, were down 
from December 31, 2020, due to the sales of loans purchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods.

(1)  Quarterly net charge-offs as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in third 
quarter 2021, compared with the prior quarter, was due to higher 
recoveries in the commercial and industrial portfolio driven by 
the oil, gas, and pipeline industry. 

The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in third 

quarter 2021, compared with the prior quarter, was driven by 
lower losses in credit card and auto, partially offset by an increase 
in other consumer losses. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of loan charge-
offs. For additional information on customer accommodations in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management 
– Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related Lending 
Accommodations” section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other 
off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for 
loans, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our ACL for debt securities, see the “Balance 
Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale and Held-To-Maturity Debt 
Securities” section and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Instruments (CECL) on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K.

severe recession, reflecting continued economic impacts from 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent 

risks inherent in our processes and assumptions such as 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments. We also considered the 
significant uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the 
economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
incremental risks to our loan portfolio. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at September 30 and June 30, 2021, are 
presented in Table 25. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 24 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans decreased $5.0 billion, or 25%, from 
December 31, 2020, reflecting better portfolio credit quality and 
improvements in current and forecasted economic conditions. 
Total provision for credit losses for loans was $(1.4) billion in 
third quarter 2021, compared with $751 million in the same 
period a year ago, reflecting lower net charge-offs and 
improvements in current and forecasted economic conditions. 
The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio 
segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is 
included in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 

estimate of the ACL for loans. The scenarios generally include a 
base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. In our estimate of the ACL for 
loans at September 30, 2021, we weighted the base scenario and 
the downside scenarios. The base scenario assumed economic 
improvements in the near term with a return to normalized levels 
near the end of 2022. The downside scenarios assumed 
economic conditions ranging from a mild recession to a more

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
GDP), among other factors. We observed economic 
improvements in the first nine months of 2021; however, there 
remained significant uncertainty related to the length and 
severity of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the impact of other factors that may influence the level of 
eventual losses and corresponding requirements for future 
amounts of the ACL, including the impact of economic stimulus 
programs and customer accommodation activity. The COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to impact the recognition of credit 
losses in our loan portfolios and may result in increases or 
decreases in our ACL. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $14.7 billion at 

September 30, 2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total 
loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects 
existing factors as of the date of determination, including 
economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for 
loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is 
possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for 
determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  For 
information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability For Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and 
private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for 
unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 

• 

• 

• 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement of advances of 
delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. Due to payment deferrals provided as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of our servicing 
advances of principal and interest remained elevated. The 
amount of these advances may increase if additional payment 
deferrals are provided. Payment deferrals also delay the 
collection of contractually specified servicing fees, resulting in 
lower net servicing income. 

Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase 

loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes 
exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid 
by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash 
and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. As a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our repurchases of these loans 
were elevated in 2020 but returned to more normalized levels in 
the first nine months of 2021. These repurchased loan balances 
were $20.4 billion and $34.8 billion at September 30, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020, respectively, which included $17.0 billion 
and $29.9 billion, respectively, in our held for investment loan 
portfolio, with the remainder in loans held for sale. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage 
banking activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For 
information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 
Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a

slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 26, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and 
short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three 
years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 
0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for 
the scenarios presented in Table 26: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across 
the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The interest rate sensitivity included in Table 26 indicates 
that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our 
assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets 
would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. 

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by 

mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management 
– Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information. For additional information on our trading assets and 
liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
additional information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment of private equity investments. For information on 
our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities,

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For additional information on our 
monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market 
Risk – Trading Activities” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 

Table 27:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 27 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 
category. The decrease in average Company Trading General VaR 
for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, compared with the 
same period a year ago, was driven by a greater presence of 
market volatility dropping out of the 12-month historical 
lookback window used to calculate average Company Trading 
General VaR for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Market 
volatility present in average Company Trading General VaR for 
the quarter ended September 30, 2020, was driven by the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, changes in interest rate 
curves and a significant widening of credit spreads.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

We also have marketable equity securities that include 

investments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair 
value changes in these marketable equity securities are 
recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 6 
(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To help achieve this objective, we monitor both 

the consolidated company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis 
to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, 
deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. The Parent acts as a source 
of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term 
debt and equity, and WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), provides 
funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the 
Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For 
additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, 
see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section 
in our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on the IHC, 
see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and 
Related Matters” section in our 2021 Second Quarter Report on 
Form 10-Q. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that 
establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity requirement 
consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) established by 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule 
requires a covered banking organization to hold high-quality 
liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its 
projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our 
HQLA under the rule predominantly consists of central bank 
deposits, government debt securities, and mortgage-backed 
securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company 
on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions 
(IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules 
issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies 
to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total 
assets of $10 billion or more. As of September 30, 2021, we were 
compliant with the NSFR requirement.

(2)  Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule. 

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the 
exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 29, which also includes encumbered securities that are not 
included as available HQLA in the calculation of the LCR. 

Table 29:  Primary Sources of Liquidity 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of September 30, 2021, the 
consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo 
National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 
100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash 
outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 28 presents 
the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated 
LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule 
requirements.

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

Included in encumbered securities at September 30, 2021, were securities with a fair value of $2.0 billion, which were purchased in September 2021, but settled in October 2021. 

September 30, 2021 

December 31, 2020 

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 29, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. As of September 30, 2021, we also maintained 
approximately $208.3 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 170% and 158% of total 
loans at September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. Additional funding is provided by long-term debt 
and short-term borrowings. Table 30 shows selected information 
for short-term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 
30 days. We pledge certain financial instruments that we own to 
collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities 
financings. For additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” 
section of Note 12 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 

proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Depending on market conditions and our 
liquidity position, we may redeem or repurchase, and 
subsequently retire, our outstanding debt securities in privately 
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or 
otherwise. Table 31 provides the aggregate carrying value of 
long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) 
for the remainder of 2021 and the following years thereafter, as 
of September 30, 2021.

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

On July 12, 2021, Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) 
upgraded the senior debt rating of the Company to A1 from A2 

as a result of revisions to its bank ratings methodology. On 
September 28, 2021, S&P Global Ratings affirmed the 
Company’s ratings and retained the stable ratings outlook. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 Form 10-K for 

additional information regarding our credit ratings and the 
potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our 
liquidity and operations, as well as Note 14 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 

as of September 30, 2021, are presented in Table 32.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. FHLB members are 
required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, the amount of any future investment in the capital 
stock of the FHLBs is not determinable.

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
September 30, 2021, increased $13.0 billion from December 31, 
2020, predominantly as a result of $15.8 billion of Wells Fargo 
net income, partially offset by $2.6 billion of common and 
preferred stock dividends. During the first nine months of 2021, 
we issued $957 million of common stock, substantially all of 
which was issued in connection with employee compensation and 
benefits. During the first nine months of 2021, we repurchased 
167 million shares of common stock at a cost of $7.5 billion. For 
additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital 
Planning and Stress Testing” section below. 

In the first nine months of 2021, we issued $5.8 billion of 
preferred stock and redeemed $6.7 billion of preferred stock. For 
additional information, see Note 16 (Preferred Stock) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo. 
Our capital adequacy is assessed based on the lower of our risk-
based capital ratios calculated under the two approaches. The 
Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments. Table 33 and Table 34 present the 
risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company on a 
fully phased-in basis under the Standardized Approach and 
Advanced Approach, respectively, as of September 30, 2021. 

Table 33:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach 

Table 34:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 33 and Table 34, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress. 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. The Company’s stress capital 
buffer for the period October 1, 2020, through September 30, 
2021, was 2.50%. On August 5, 2021, the FRB confirmed that the 
Company's stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2021, 
through September 30, 2022, is 3.10%. 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are 

also subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional 
capital surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must 
annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use 
the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method 
one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-
jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, 
consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and 
the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method 
(method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability 
with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally 
result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because 
the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on 
data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is 
subject to change in future years. We expect our G-SIB capital 
surcharge to decrease by 50 basis points to 1.50% beginning in 
first quarter 2022, subject to finalization in fourth quarter 
2021. 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with transition requirements

Capital Management (continued) 

and are scheduled to be fully phased-in beginning January 1, 
2022. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Although we report certain capital amounts and 
ratios in accordance with transition requirements for bank 
regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our capital on a fully 

phased-in basis. For information about our capital requirements 
calculated in accordance with transition requirements, see 
Note 23 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other 
Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 35 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, 

RWAs and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at 
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. Fully phased-in 
total capital amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP 
financial measures that are used by management, bank 
regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and 
monitor the Company’s capital position. See Table 36 for 
information regarding the calculation and components of our 
CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital and RWAs, as well as a 
corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures for our 
fully phased-in total capital amounts.

In second quarter 2021, we elected to change our accounting method for low-income housing tax credit investments and elected to change the presentation of investment tax credits related to solar 
energy investments. Prior period total equity was revised to conform with the current period presentation. Prior period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related metrics were not 
revised. 
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
At September 30, 2021, the impact of the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking regulators on our regulatory capital was an increase in capital of $463 million, reflecting a $991 million 
(post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $5.8 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in tier 2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, in each case with any excess 
allowance for credit losses being deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
Includes an increase of $132 million under the Standardized Approach and a decrease of $1.4 billion under the Advanced Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on our excess 
allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2021. See footnote (4) to this table.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) 
tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; 
and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), 

which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of 
tangible common equity. The methodology of determining 
tangible common equity may differ among companies. 
Management believes that tangible book value per common 
share and return on average tangible common equity, which 
utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures 
because they enable management, investors, and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 39 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 40 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
September 30, 2021. 

Table 40:  Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 
rules. For information regarding the proposed amendments to 
the SLR rules, see the “Capital Management – Leverage 
Requirements” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

At September 30, 2021, the Company’s SLR was 6.94%, and 

each of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements. 
Table 41 presents information regarding the calculation and 
components of the Company’s SLR and tier 1 leverage ratio.

Adjustment represents derivatives and collateral netting exposures as defined for

Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum

TLAC ratios are calculated using the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking 
regulators. 
Represents the minimum required to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments. 

(3)  Our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements are calculated 
based on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced 
Approaches. 
Total leverage exposure at December 31, 2020, reflected an interim final rule issued by the 
FRB that temporarily allowed a bank holding company to exclude on-balance sheet 
amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the 
calculation of its total leverage exposure.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 100 
basis points above our regulatory requirement plus an 
incremental buffer of 25 to 50 basis points. Our capital targets 
are subject to change based on various factors, including changes 
to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large 
banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies, changes to the 
regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital 
actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the 
institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 

amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At September 30, 2021, we had remaining Board authority 

to repurchase approximately 500 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during third quarter 2021, see Part II, Item 2 in 
this Report. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. For a 
discussion of other significant regulations and regulatory 
oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our 
business, see the “Regulatory Matters” and “Risk Factors” 
sections in our 2020 Form 10-K and the “Regulatory Matters” 
section in our 2021 First and Second Quarter Reports on Form 
10-Q.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern:

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2020. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or

Forward-Looking Statements (continued) 

financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company, we refer you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K.
