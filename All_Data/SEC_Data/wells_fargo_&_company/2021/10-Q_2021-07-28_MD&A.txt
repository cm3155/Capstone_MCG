This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2020 Form 10-K). 

When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one 
in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses 
in the U.S., and is the leading middle market banking provider in 
the U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and 
mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance, through our four reportable operating 
segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, 
Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment 
Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 37 on Fortune’s 2021 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at June 30, 2021. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements to build the right foundation for all that lies ahead. 
The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we may experience issues or delays along 
the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or delays with 
one regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and 
failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a 
timely basis could result in additional penalties, enforcement 
actions, and other negative consequences. While we still have 
significant work to do, the Company is committed to devoting 
the resources necessary to operate with strong business 
practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and 
have an appropriate culture in place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 

of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 
As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the 
extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from 
the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received 
by the Company from loans made in connection with these 
programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-
profit organizations approved by the FRB that support small 
businesses. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had not excluded 
these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of the asset 
cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to 
assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and 
improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet 
satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we 
believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other 
enforcement actions.

Overview (continued) 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2020 Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable 
and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust 
efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and 
information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with 
our regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For additional information, including related legal 
and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
Change in Accounting Policies 
In second quarter 2021, we retroactively changed the accounting 
for certain tax-advantaged investments to better align the 
financial statement presentation with the economic impact of 
these investments. 

Specifically, we elected to change our accounting for low-
income housing tax credit investments from the equity method 
of accounting to the proportional amortization method. Under 
the proportional amortization method, the amortization of the 
investments and the related tax impacts are recognized in 
income tax expense. Previously, we recognized the amortization 
of the investments in other noninterest income and the related 
tax impacts were recognized in income tax expense. 

Also, we elected to change the presentation of investment 
tax credits related to solar energy investments. We reclassified 
the investment tax credits on our consolidated balance sheet 
from accrued expenses and other liabilities to a reduction of the 
carrying value of the investment balances. We also reclassified 
the investment tax credits from income tax expense to interest 
income for solar energy leases or noninterest income for solar 
energy equity investments. 

These changes had a nominal impact on net income and 
retained earnings on an annual basis; however, our quarterly 
results were affected in both the second and third quarters of 

2020 due to the impact of these changes on the estimated 
annual effective income tax rate applied to each quarter. These 
changes also improved our efficiency ratio and generally 
increased our effective income tax rate from what was previously 
reported. 

Prior period financial statement line items have been revised 

to conform with the current period presentation. Prior period 
risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related metrics 
were not revised. For additional information, including the 
financial statement line items impacted by these changes, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working 
diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry 
out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the 
public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help customers, 
employees and communities. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing 
forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans 
guaranteed under a program called the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). Since its inception, we have funded 
approximately 282,000 loans under the PPP totaling 
approximately $14.0 billion, and more than $5.8 billion of 
principal forgiveness has been provided on qualifying PPP loans. 
We deferred approximately $420 million of SBA processing fees 
in 2020 that will be recognized as interest income over the terms 
of the loans. We voluntarily committed to donate all of the gross 
processing fees received from PPP loans funded in 2020. 
Through June 30, 2021, we donated approximately $260 million 
of these processing fees. We funded approximately $3.5 billion of 
PPP loans in the first half of 2021 and deferred approximately 
$270 million of related SBA processing fees that will be 
recognized as interest income over the terms of the loans. We 
have committed to donate any net profits from processing fees 
received from PPP loans funded in 2021. For additional 
information on the CARES Act and the PPP, see the “Overview – 
Recent Developments – COVID-19 Pandemic” section in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely-
referenced benchmark rate, which is published in five currencies 
and a range of tenors, and seeks to estimate the cost at which 
banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. On 
March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority and the 
administrator of LIBOR announced that LIBOR will no longer be 
published on a representative basis after December 31, 2021, 
with the exception of the most commonly used tenors of U.S. 
dollar (USD) LIBOR which will no longer be published on a 
representative basis after June 30, 2023. Federal banking 
agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking 
organizations to cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in 
new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by 
December 31, 2021.

and liabilities, as well as initiatives created by our LIBOR

LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly

in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Actions and Restrictions 
In June 2021, the Company completed the 2021 Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test process. We 
expect our stress capital buffer (SCB) for the period October 1, 
2021, through September 30, 2022, to be 3.10%. The FRB has 
indicated it will publish our final SCB by August 31, 2021. 

On July 27, 2021, the Board approved an increase to the 

Company's third quarter 2021 common stock dividend to 
$0.20 per share. Additionally, our capital plan includes gross 
common share repurchases of approximately $18 billion for the 
four-quarter period beginning third quarter 2021 through 
second quarter 2022. 

For additional information about capital planning, see the 

“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” 
section in this Report. 

In June 2021, we redeemed the remaining $350 million of 
our Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series N. 
In July 2021, we issued $1.25 billion of our Preferred Stock, 
Series DD. 

Business and Portfolio Divestitures 
On February 23, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell 
Wells Fargo Asset Management for a purchase price of 
$2.1 billion. As part of the transaction, we will own a 9.9% equity 
interest and continue to serve as a client and distribution partner. 
On March 23, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell our 
Corporate Trust Services business for a purchase price of 
$750 million. Both transactions are expected to close in the 
second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. 

In the first half of 2021, we completed substantially all of the 

previously announced sale of our student loan portfolio, which 
resulted in gains in other noninterest income of $208 million and 
$147 million in first and second quarter 2021, respectively, and 
goodwill write-downs in other noninterest expense of 
$104 million and $79 million in first and second quarter 2021, 
respectively.

In second quarter 2021, we generated $6.0 billion of net income 
and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.38, 
compared with a net loss of $3.8 billion and diluted loss per 
common share of $1.01 in the same period a year ago. Financial 
performance for second quarter 2021, compared with the same 
period a year ago, included the following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity 
securities and mortgage banking income, partially offset by 
lower net interest income; 
provision for credit losses decreased reflecting lower net 
charge-offs and improvements in the economic 
environment; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses and lower professional and outside services expense; 
average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in the residential mortgage and credit card 
portfolios, weak demand for commercial loans, and the 
reclassification of student loans, included in other consumer 
loans, to loans held for sale after the announced sale of the 
portfolio in fourth quarter 2020; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in consumer 
deposits in the Consumer Banking and Lending and Wealth

and Investment Management (WIM) operating segments 
due to higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer 
customers reflecting government stimulus programs and 
payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic 
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
partially offset by actions taken to manage under the asset 
cap which reduced deposits in the Corporate and Investment 
Banking operating segment and Corporate. 

In the first half of 2021, we generated $10.7 billion of net 
income and diluted EPS of $2.40, compared with a net loss of 
$2.9 billion and diluted loss per common share of $0.94 in the 
same period a year ago. Financial performance for the first half of 
2021, compared with the same period a year ago, included the 
following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity 
securities and mortgage banking income, partially offset by 
lower net interest income; 
provision for credit losses decreased reflecting lower net 
charge-offs due to better portfolio credit quality driven by 
improvements in the economic environment;

Overview (continued) 

• 

• 

• 

noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses and lower professional and outside services expense, 
partially offset by higher personnel expense; 
average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in the residential mortgage and credit card 
portfolios, weak demand for commercial loans, and the 
reclassification of student loans, included in other consumer 
loans, to loans held for sale after the announced sale of the 
portfolio in fourth quarter 2020; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in consumer 
deposits in the Consumer Banking and Lending and Wealth 
and Investment Management (WIM) operating segments 
due to higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer 
customers reflecting government stimulus programs and 
payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic 
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
partially offset by actions taken to manage under the asset 
cap which reduced deposits in the Corporate and Investment 
Banking operating segment and Corporate. 

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in the first half of 2021, 
with total equity of $193.1 billion at June 30, 2021, compared 
with $185.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Our liquidity and 
regulatory capital ratios remained strong at June 30, 2021, 
including: 
• 

our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 123%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%; 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 12.07%, which 
continued to exceed both the regulatory requirement of 9% 
and our current internal target; and 
our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.11%, 
compared with the regulatory requirement of 21.50%.

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts. 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for second quarter 2021 was $6.0 billion 
($1.38 diluted EPS), compared with a net loss of $3.8 billion 
($1.01 diluted loss per common share) in the same period a year 
ago. Net income increased in second quarter 2021, compared 
with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a 
$10.8 billion decrease in provision for credit losses, a $3.1 billion 
increase in noninterest income, and a $1.2 billion decrease in 
noninterest expense, partially offset by a $3.4 billion increase in 
income tax expense and a $1.1 billion decrease in net interest 
income. 

Net income for the first half of 2021 was $10.7 billion 

($2.40 diluted EPS), compared with a net loss of $2.9 billion 
($0.94 diluted loss per common share) in the same period a year 
ago. Net income increased in the first half of 2021, compared 
with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a 
$15.8 billion decrease in provision for credit losses and a 
$6.0 billion increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 
$4.0 billion increase in income tax expense and a $3.6 billion 
decrease in net interest income. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the improving economic environment. 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$16.4 billion at June 30, 2021, decreased $3.3 billion from 
December 31, 2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(2.4) billion in 

• 

• 

• 

the first half of 2021, down from $13.4 billion in the same 
period a year ago. The decrease in the ACL for loans and the 
provision for credit losses in the first half of 2021, compared 
with the same period a year ago, reflected improvements in 
current and forecasted economic conditions. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.92% at June 30, 
2021, compared with 2.22% at December 31, 2020. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $80 million, 
or 7 basis points of average commercial loans, in second 
quarter 2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$602 million, or 44 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, predominantly driven by lower losses in our commercial 
and industrial portfolio primarily within the oil, gas and 
pipelines industry, and in the real estate mortgage portfolio. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $301 million, 
or 32 basis points of average consumer loans, in second 
quarter 2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$511 million, or 48 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, driven by lower losses in all consumer loan portfolios as 
a result of payment deferral activities, government stimulus 
programs instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $7.5 billion at June 30, 
2021, decreased $1.4 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 
2020, predominantly driven by decreases in our commercial 
and industrial portfolio reflecting improvements in the 
economic environment, and decreases in our residential 
mortgage portfolios reflecting loan sales and payment 
deferral activities. NPAs represented 0.88% of total loans at 
June 30, 2021. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in both 
the second quarter and first half of 2021, compared with the 
same periods a year ago, due to the impact of lower interest 
rates and lower loan balances reflecting soft demand and 
elevated prepayments, as well as higher mortgage-backed 
securities premium amortization, partially offset by a reduction 
in long-term debt. The first half of 2021 was also impacted by 
unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results. 

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended June 30, 2021 
and 2020. 

For additional information about net interest income and 

net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net

Second quarter 2021 vs. second quarter 2020 

• 

higher residential real estate held for sale (HFS) origination 
volumes in our retail production channel; 

Deposit-related fees increased driven by: 
• 

lower fee waivers and reversals compared with a second 
quarter 2020 that included elevated fee waivers due to our 
actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by an increase in transaction service volumes and 
repricing. 

• 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees increased 
reflecting higher market valuations on client investment assets. 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” and “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Corporate – Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) 
Assets Under Management” sections in this Report. 

Card fees increased reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction volumes. 

Servicing income, net increased due to: 
• 

higher income from mortgage servicing right (MSR) 
valuation changes and related hedges driven by negative 
valuation adjustments in second quarter 2020 for higher 
expected servicing costs and prepayment estimates due to 
changes in economic conditions; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others resulting from prepayments. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales increased 
driven by: 
• 

higher gains related to the re-securitization of loans we 
purchased from Government National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA) loan securitization pools in 2020; and 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower HFS origination volumes in our correspondent 
production channel; and 
lower margins in our retail and correspondent production 
channels. 

• 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities decreased driven by fewer 
gains in asset-backed finance and credit products due to limited 
credit spread movement compared with a second quarter 2020 
that reflected gains driven by volatility in credit spreads from the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Net gains on debt securities decreased due to lower gains from 
fewer sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and 
municipal bonds. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities increased driven by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
from our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; and 
higher realized gains on the sales of equity securities; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower gains on deferred compensation plan investments 
(largely offset in personnel expense). Refer to Table 3a for 
the results for our deferred compensation plan and related 
hedges. 

Other income decreased due to: 
• 

• 

lower gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans which 
were reclassified to held for sale in 2019; and 
higher valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk, 
including the timing and amount of final settlement, 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that

lower client trading activity for interest rate products, 
equities, and commodities; 

partially offset by: 
• 

a gain on the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio. 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher client trading activity for asset-backed finance 
products. 

Net gains on debt securities decreased due to lower gains from 
fewer sales of agency MBS and municipal bonds. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities increased driven by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
from our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; 
lower impairment on equity securities due to the market 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in first quarter 2020;

higher HFS origination volume in our retail production 
channel; 
higher gains related to the re-securitization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020; and 
higher gains due to losses in the first half of 2020 driven by 
the impact of interest rate volatility on hedging activities

lower salaries as a result of reduced headcount; and 
lower deferred compensation expense; 

Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense, including the 
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based 
compensation; and 
higher revenue-related compensation expense. 

• 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for technology contracts and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in second 
quarter 2020. 

Occupancy expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

lower rent expense; and 
lower cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expenses 
compared with a second quarter 2020 that included higher 
expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
litigation accruals and customer remediation accruals. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors.

Other expenses increased driven by a write-down of goodwill in 
second quarter 2021 related to the sale of a portion of our 
student loan portfolio. 

First half of 2021 vs. first half of 2020 

Personnel expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense, including the 
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based 
compensation; 
higher revenue-related compensation expense; and 
higher deferred compensation expense; 

• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower salaries as a result of reduced headcount. 

Table 3a presents results for our deferred compensation 
plan and related hedges. In second quarter 2020, we entered into 
arrangements to transition our economic hedges of the deferred 
compensation plan liabilities from equity securities to derivative 
instruments. As a result of this transition, changes in fair value of 
derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred 
compensation plan are reported in personnel expense rather than 
in net gains (losses) from equity securities within noninterest 
income. For additional information on the derivatives used in the 
economic hedges, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for technology contracts and 

the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in second 
quarter 2020.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Occupancy expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

lower rent expense; and 
lower cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expenses 
compared with a first half of 2020 that included higher 
expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
litigation accruals and customer remediation accruals. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by a 
continued reduction in marketing and brand campaign volumes 
due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Restructuring charges increased related to our efficiency 
initiatives that began in third quarter 2020. For additional 
information on restructuring charges, see Note 19 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Other expenses increased driven by: 
• 

a write-down of goodwill in the first half of 2021 related to 
the sale of substantially all of our student loan portfolio; 
higher charitable donations expense driven by the donation 
of PPP processing fees; and 
higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 
deposit assessment expense driven by a higher assessment 
rate; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense was $1.4 billion in second quarter 2021, 
compared with an income tax benefit of $2.0 billion in the same 
period a year ago. The effective income tax rate was 19.3% for 
second quarter 2021, compared with 34.2% for the same period 
a year ago. 

Income tax expense was $2.3 billion in the first half of 2021, 
compared with an income tax benefit of $1.6 billion in the same 
period a year ago. The effective income tax rate was 18.0% for 
the first half of 2021, compared with 36.0% for the same period a 
year ago. 

The increase in our income tax expense for both the second 
quarter and first half of 2021, compared with the same periods a 
year ago, was driven by higher pre-tax income, including the 
impact of the changes in accounting policy for certain tax-
advantaged investments. For additional information on the 
changes in accounting policy, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 4. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income 
from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

In March 2021, we announced an agreement to sell our 
Corporate Trust Services business and, in second quarter 2021, 
we moved the business from the Commercial Banking operating 
segment to Corporate. Prior period balances have been revised 
to conform with the current period presentation. This change did 
not impact the previously reported consolidated financial results 
of the Company. 

In second quarter 2021, we elected to change our 

accounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) 
investments and elected to change the presentation of 
investment tax credits related to solar energy investments. 
These accounting policy changes had a nominal impact on 
reportable operating segment results. Prior period financial 
statement line items for the Company, as well as for the 
reportable operating segments, have been revised to conform 
with the current period presentation. Our LIHTC investments are 
included in the Corporate and Investment Banking operating 
segment and our solar energy investments are included in the 
Commercial Banking operating segment. For additional 
information, see the “Recent Developments” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results.

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see the “Corporate” section below. In March 2021, 
we announced an agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and, in second quarter 2021, we moved the business from the Commercial Banking operating segment to Corporate. Prior 
period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are 
included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due status. 
Excludes certain private label new account openings.

Second quarter 2021 vs. second quarter 2020 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher mortgage banking noninterest income due to higher 
gains related to the re-securitization of loans we purchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020, as well as 
higher income from MSR valuation changes and related 
hedges; 
higher card fees reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction 
volumes; and 
higher deposit-related fees driven by lower fee waivers and 
reversals compared with a second quarter 2020 that 
included elevated fee waivers due to our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances; and 
lower other income driven by lower gains on loan sales. 

• 

• 

•

Wells Fargo & Company 

• 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; 
lower personnel expense driven by additional payments in 
second quarter 2020 for certain customer-facing and 
support employees and for back-up child care services, as 
well as lower branch staffing expense in second quarter 
2021 related to efficiency initiatives in Consumer and Small 
Business Banking, partially offset by higher revenue-related 
compensation in Home Lending; and 
lower expense allocated from enterprise functions, 
reflecting risk management and technology support related 
expenses; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher charitable donations expense due to the donation of 
PPP processing fees; and 
higher FDIC deposit assessment expense driven by a higher

First half of 2021 vs. first half of 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher mortgage banking noninterest income due to higher 
retail HFS origination volumes and margins, and higher 
income from MSR valuation changes and related hedges; 
and 
higher card fees reflecting higher interchange fees, net of 
rewards, driven by increased purchase and transaction 
volumes, partially offset by lower late fees due to higher 
payment rates; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances; 
lower other income driven by lower gains on loan sales; and 
lower deposit-related fees driven by higher fee waivers and 
reversals, as well as higher average consumer deposit 
account balances due to the economic slowdown associated 
with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

• 

• 
• 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; 
lower personnel expense driven by a first half of 2020 that 
included additional payments for certain customer-facing 
and support employees and for back-up child care services, 
as well as lower branch staffing expense in the first half of 
2021 related to efficiency initiatives in Consumer and Small 
Business Banking, partially offset by higher revenue-related 
compensation in Home Lending; and 
lower advertising and promotion expense; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher charitable donations expense due to the donation of 
PPP processing fees; 
higher FDIC deposit assessment expense driven by a higher 
assessment rate; and 
higher expense allocated from enterprise functions, 
reflecting risk management and technology support related 
expenses. 

• 

• 

• 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment.

Second quarter 2021 vs. second quarter 2020 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances and 
the lower interest rate environment; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher other noninterest income due to gains on equity 
securities and higher income from renewable energy 
investments; and 
higher deposit-related fees due to higher treasury 
management fees, driven by an increase in transaction 
service volumes and repricing. 

• 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower spending related to efficiency initiatives, including 
lower personnel expense from reduced headcount; 
lower lease expense reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio; 
lower professional and outside services expense reflecting 
decreased project-related expense; and 
lower expenses allocated from enterprise functions, 
including lower technology expenses. 

• 

• 

• 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment.

economic environment. 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances; and 
lower lease income reflecting a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio;

higher other noninterest income due to gains on equity 
securities, impairments on equity securities in first quarter 
2020, and higher income from renewable energy 
investments; and 
higher deposit-related fees due to higher treasury 
management fees, driven by a lower earnings credit rate due

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net gains from trading activities reflecting fewer gains 
in asset-backed finance and credit products due to limited 
credit spread movement compared with a second quarter 
2020 that reflected gains driven by volatility in credit 
spreads from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, lower deposit balances, and lower trading-
related assets;

partially offset by: 
• 

higher other noninterest income driven by higher mortgage 
banking income due to higher servicing income, reflecting a 
reversal of an impairment of commercial MSRs in second 
quarter 2021, compared with the related impairment 
recorded in second quarter 2020, as well as higher gains on 
the sales of mortgage loans; 
higher income from low income housing and equity 
investments; and

lower deferred compensation plan investment results 
included in other noninterest income (largely offset by 
personnel expense); and 
lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 

• 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation, partially offset by lower deferred 
compensation expense; and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in second 
quarter 2020. 

Total deposits (average) increased primarily due to growth in 
customer balances in both The Private Bank and Wells Fargo 
Advisors. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First half of 2021 vs. first half of 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

higher investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to higher market valuations on WIM advisory assets; and 
higher deferred compensation plan investment results 
included in other noninterest income (largely offset by 
personnel expense); 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher deposit balances. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment. 

• 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation and higher deferred compensation expense; 
and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in the first 
half of 2020; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower professional and outside services expense driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants 
and contractors. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased primarily due 
to growth in customer balances in both The Private Bank and 
Wells Fargo Advisors. 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 5h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business for the second quarter 
and first half of 2021 and 2020. Management believes that 
advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, 
investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts 
may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. 

For second quarter 2021 and 2020, the average fee rate by 

account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, 
net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, 
liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable 
operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and 
affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In 
addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to 
our efficiency initiatives. See Note 19 (Restructuring Charges) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on 
restructuring charges. Corporate also includes certain lines of 

business that management has determined are no longer 
consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company, as 
well as results for previously divested businesses. In March 2021, 
we announced an agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services 
business and, in second quarter 2021, we moved the business 
from the Commercial Banking operating segment to Corporate. 
Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the 
current period presentation. Table 5i, Table 5j, and Table 5k 
provide additional information for Corporate.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 
(2) 

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 
Beginning in first quarter 2021, employees who were notified of displacement remained as headcount in their respective operating segment rather than included in Corporate. 

Second quarter 2021 vs. second quarter 2020 

First half of 2021 vs. first half of 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher gains on equity securities in our affiliated venture 
capital and private equity businesses; and 
a gain on the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio 
and a modest gain on the sale of our Canadian equipment 
finance business; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower loan balances; 
lower gains on debt securities due to fewer sales; and 
lower gains on deferred compensation plan investments 
(largely offset by personnel expense). 

• 

• 
• 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment and lower provision associated with the 
sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio. 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals and customer remediation accruals; and 
lower deferred compensation plan expense; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

a write-down of goodwill in second quarter 2021 related to 
the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio. 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

higher gains on equity securities in our affiliated venture 
capital and private equity businesses, as well as impairments 
on equity securities in first quarter 2020 due to the market 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ; 
higher gains on deferred compensation plan investments 
(largely offset by personnel expense); and 
a gain on the sale of substantially all of our student loan 
portfolio; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting 
results, and lower loan balances; and 
lower gains on debt securities due to fewer sales. 

• 

• 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improving 
economic environment and lower provision associated with the 
sale of substantially all of our student loan portfolio. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense, including the 
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based 
compensation; 
higher deferred compensation expense; and 
a write-down of goodwill in 2021 related to the sale of 
substantially all of our student loan portfolio.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets (as a lessor) of $5.6 billion, 
which was net of $1.9 billion of accumulated depreciation, as of 
June 30, 2021. The average age of our rail cars is 21 years and the 
rail cars are typically leased under short-term leases of 3 to 5 
years. Our three largest concentrations, which represented 55% 
of our rail car fleet as of June 30, 2021, were rail cars used for the 
transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand 
products. Impairments may result in the future based on 
changing economic and market conditions affecting the long-
term demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our 
assumptions for impairment are sensitive to estimated 

utilization and rental rates, as well as the estimated economic life 
of the leased asset. For additional information on the accounting 
for impairment of operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

In addition, Corporate includes assets under management 
(AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional 
Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets of $20 billion and 
$580 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2021, which we continue to 
administer at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a transition 
services agreement. The transition services agreement 
terminates in December 2021, with available options to extend.

Second quarter 2021 vs. second quarter 2020 

First half of 2021 vs. first half of 2020 

Total assets (average) increased due to: 
• 

an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
managed by corporate treasury as a result of an increase in 
deposits from the reportable operating segments; and 
an increase in held-to-maturity debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; 

partially offset by: 
• 

a decline in available-for-sale debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; 
a decline in average equity securities due to the transition 
from equity securities to derivative instruments for 
economic hedges of the deferred compensation plan 
liabilities in second quarter 2020 and a reduction in Federal 
Home Loan Bank stock, partially offset by higher balances in 
our venture capital business; and 
a decline in loans due to the sale of a portion of our student 
loan portfolio.

Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) Assets Under 
Management  We earn investment advisory and other asset-
based fees from managing and administering assets through 
WFAM, which offers Wells Fargo proprietary mutual funds and 
manages institutional separate accounts. Generally, we earn fees 
from AUM where we have discretionary management authority 
over the investments and generate fees as a percentage of the 
market value of the AUM. WFAM assets under management 

consist of equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money 
market, and stable value, and include client assets that are 
managed or sub-advised on behalf of other Wells Fargo lines of 
business. Table 5k presents WFAM AUM activity for the second 
quarter and first half of 2021 and 2020. Management believes 
that AUM is a useful metric because it allows management, 
investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts 
may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees.

Inflows include new managed account assets, contributions, dividends and interest. 
(2)  Outflows include closed managed account assets, withdrawals and client management fees. 
(3)  Market impact reflects gains and losses on portfolio investments. 
(4)  Money Market funds activity is presented on a net inflow or net outflow basis, because the gross flows are not meaningful nor used by management as an indicator of performance.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At June 30, 2021, our assets totaled $1.95 trillion, down 
$6.9 billion from December 31, 2020. 

The following discussion provides additional information 
about the major components of our consolidated balance sheet.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $33 million and $28 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $77 million and $41 million related to 
held-to-maturity debt securities at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 6 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in 
available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K for information on our investment management objectives 
and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for information on liquidity 
and interest rate risk. 

The fair value of AFS debt securities decreased from 
December 31, 2020, as purchases were more than offset by 
runoff, sales and transfers to HTM debt securities due to actions 
taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management 
purposes. 

The net amortized cost of HTM debt securities increased 

from December 31, 2020, as purchases and transfers from AFS 
debt securities were partially offset by runoff. 

At June 30, 2021, 94% of the combined AFS and HTM debt 

securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on 
external ratings where available and, where not available, based 
on internal credit grades. 

The total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt 
securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher 
interest rates, partially offset by tighter credit spreads. See 
Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) 
to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
on AFS and HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt 
securities by security type. 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 7 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans were relatively flat 
compared with December 31, 2020. Consumer loans decreased 
from December 31, 2020, driven by a decrease in the residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio due to paydowns and the transfer 
of $10.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale 
(LHFS), substantially all of which related to the sales of loans 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods, 
partially offset by originations of $30.8 billion.

Deposits 
Deposits increased from December 31, 2020, reflecting: 
• 

higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer 
customers reflecting government stimulus programs and 
payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic 
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; 

partially offset by: 
• 

actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in 
declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of 

deposit (CDs), and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. 
offices. 

Table 8 provides additional information regarding deposits. 

Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest 
income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided 
in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” section and 
Table 1 earlier in this Report.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity 
securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, 
derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are 
designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) 
manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify 
our funding sources. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, 
we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 11 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 11 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. For additional information about how we 
manage risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K. The discussion that follows supplements our 
discussion of the management of certain risks contained in the 
“Risk Management” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part of 
IRM, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk 
reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to 
credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit 
Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio 
Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on 
our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk. 
Table 9 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio 
segment and class of financing receivable.

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in second quarter 2021 
reflected continued improvement in the economic environment. 
In particular: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $7.4 billion at June 30, 2021, down 
from $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans decreased to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2021, 
compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans declined to $3.8 billion at 
June 30, 2021, compared with $3.9 billion at December 31, 
2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.86% of total loans at 
June 30, 2021, compared with 0.98% at December 31, 2020. 

•  Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of our average 

commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 0.07% and 
0.32% in the second quarter and 0.10% and 0.35% in the first 
half of 2021, respectively, compared with 0.44% and 0.48% 
in the second quarter and 0.35% and 0.51% in the first half of 
2020. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were 
$277 million and $460 million in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, at June 30, 2021, 
compared with $78 million and $612 million at 
December 31, 2020.

$(2.4) billion in the second quarter and first half of 2021, 
respectively, compared with $9.6 billion and $13.4 billion for 
the same periods a year ago. 
The ACL for loans decreased to $16.4 billion, or 1.92% of 
total loans, at June 30, 2021, compared with $19.7 billion, or 
2.22%, at December 31, 2020.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including:

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations  During 2020, we 
provided accommodations to customers in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals, and other 
expanded assistance for mortgage, credit card, auto, small 
business, personal and commercial lending customers. With the 
exception of residential mortgage-related accommodation 
programs, the COVID-related lending accommodations 
instituted during 2020 were no longer offered as of 
December 31, 2020. Residential mortgage accommodation 
programs, which continued during the first half of 2021, offered 
payment deferrals for up to a total of 18 months. Table 10 
summarizes the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of consumer 
loans that received accommodations under loan modification 
programs established to assist customers with the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-related 
modifications) and that remained in a deferral period as of 
June 30, 2021. 

Based on guidance in the CARES Act and the Interagency 

Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial 
Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus 
(Revised) issued by federal banking regulators in April 2020 (the 
Interagency Statement), both of which we elected to apply, loan 
modifications related to COVID-19 and that meet certain other 
criteria are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) 
classification. Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief 
provided by the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement 
impacts our regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications

related to COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting 
normally required with TDR classification. At June 30, 2021, 
substantially all residential mortgage loans that were in a deferral 
period, excluding those that were government insured/ 
guaranteed, met the criteria for TDR relief and were therefore 
not classified as TDRs. For additional information regarding the 
TDR relief provided by the CARES Act and the clarifying TDR 
accounting guidance from the Interagency Statement, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of net charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual 
status for those customers who would have otherwise moved 
into past due or nonaccrual status. Customer loans that are not 
further modified upon exit from the deferral period may be 
placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off in accordance with 
our policies if customers are unable to resume making payments 
in accordance with the contractual terms of their agreement. As 
of June 30, 2021, substantially all of our consumer loans were 
current after exiting the deferral period. For additional 
information about our COVID-related modifications, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related 
Lending Accommodations” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K.

Represents the UPB of loans that exited the deferral period and had a balance that was less than 30 days past due as of June 30, 2021. 
For residential mortgage loans still in active COVID-related accommodation programs as of June 30, 2021, 96% of first lien and 86% of junior lien mortgage loans had a loan-to-value ratio that was 
80% or lower. 
Includes credit card, auto, and other consumer loans (including personal lines/loans). 
Represents residential mortgage – first lien loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that were primarily repurchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools. For additional information on GNMA loan securitization pools, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” 
section in this Report. FHA/VA loans are entitled to payment deferrals of scheduled principal and interest up to a total of 18 months. 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 

generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $15.6 billion of the commercial and industrial loan 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at June 30, 2021, compared 
with $19.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The change was driven 
by decreases in the oil, gas and pipelines, retail, materials and 
commodities, entertainment and recreation, and technology, 
telecom and media industries reflecting improvement in the 
economic environment. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as

(2)  No other single industry had total loans in excess of $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 

concentration, is predominantly comprised of loans to 
investment firms, financial vehicles, and nonbank creditors. We 
had $88.1 billion and $80.0 billion of loans originated by our 
Asset Backed Finance (ABF) and Financial Institution Group (FIG) 
lines of business at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. These loans include: (i) loans to customers related 
to their subscription or capital calls, (ii) loans to nonbank lenders 
collateralized by commercial loans, and (iii) loans to originators or 
servicers of financial assets collateralized by residential real 
estate or other consumer loans such as credit cards, auto loans 
and leases, student loans and other financial assets eligible for 
the securitization market. These ABF and FIG loans are limited to 
a percentage of the value of the underlying financial assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. These ABF and FIG loans may also have other 
features to manage credit risk such as cross-collateralization, 
credit enhancements, and contractual re-margining of collateral 
supporting the loans. In addition, loans to financials except banks 
included collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form, all of 
which were rated AA or above, of $8.1 billion and $7.9 billion at 
June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $6.6 billion and 

$7.5 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at June 30, 2021, 
and December 31, 2020, respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines 

nonaccrual loans decreased at June 30, 2021, compared with 
December 31, 2020, driven by loan payoffs. 

We continue to perform escalated credit monitoring for 

certain industries that we consider to be directly and 
most adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio also includes non-U.S. loans of $72.1 billion and 
$63.8 billion at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, 
respectively. Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. 
loans at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, 
included: 
• 

$43.5 billion and $36.2 billion in the financials except banks 
category; 
$14.7 billion and $12.8 billion in the banks category; and 
$1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines 
category.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory 
definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized 
segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and 
loss categories. We had $15.6 billion of CRE mortgage loans 
classified as criticized at June 30, 2021, compared with 
$12.0 billion at December 31, 2020, and $2.6 billion of CRE

compared with $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase 
in criticized CRE mortgage and construction loans was driven by 
the hotel/motel, apartment, institutional, and office property 
types and reflected the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Due to uncertainty in the recovery from the economic 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit quality of certain 
property types within our CRE loan portfolio, such as retail, hotel/ 
motel, office buildings, and shopping centers, could continue to 
be adversely affected. 

The total CRE loan portfolio decreased $441 million from 
December 31, 2020, driven by a decrease in CRE mortgage loans 
predominantly related to the office, retail (excluding shopping 

Table 12:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

center), and shopping center property types, partially offset by 
an increase in loans related to apartments. The CRE loan 
portfolio included $8.4 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at June 30, 
2021. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by 
property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE 
loans are in California, New York, Florida and Texas, which 
combined represented 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The 
largest property type concentrations are office buildings at 25% 
and apartments at 20% of the portfolio.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At June 30, 2021, non-U.S. loans totaled $80.8 billion, 
representing approximately 9% of our total consolidated loans 
outstanding, compared with $72.9 billion, or approximately 8% of 
our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2020. 
Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of our total consolidated 
assets at both June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which 
gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Table 13:  Select Country Exposures 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

June 30, 2021, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$34.4 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $7.7 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise predominantly from deposits we have 
placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory 
requirements in support of our London branch. 

Table 13 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 13: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $47.6 billion exposure to financial institutions and $43.8 billion to non-financial corporations at June 30, 2021. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 93% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at both June 30, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both June 30, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020. We believe our origination process 
appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
reset risk across our residential mortgage loan portfolios and our 
ACL for loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM 
products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with 

fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the 
financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage 
loans. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For additional information on our modification 
programs, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 
For additional information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management 
– COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in this 
Report.

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolios as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of 
loans and lines secured by residential real estate collateral 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. Additional information about 
appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for their use can be found in 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section 
in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
Excluding government insured/guaranteed loans, these credit 
risk indicators on the residential mortgage portfolio were: 

• 

• 

Loans 30 days or more delinquent at June 30, 2021, totaled 
$3.7 billion, or 1% of total mortgages, compared with 
$4.7 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition 
of delinquencies; 
Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 totaled $4.3 billion, 
or 2% of total mortgages at June 30, 2021, compared with 
$5.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020; and 

•  Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 

$912 million at June 30, 2021, or less than 1% of total 
mortgages, compared with $1.6 billion, or 1%, at 
December 31, 2020. 

Information regarding credit quality indicators can be found 

in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our total residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $32.3 billion from 
December 31, 2020, driven by loan paydowns as a result of the 
low interest rate environment and the transfer of $10.8 billion of 
first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) 
substantially all of which related to the sales of loans purchased

Residential Mortgage – Junior Lien Portfolio  The residential 
mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of residential mortgage 
lines and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on 
the same property. It is not unusual for these lines and loans to 
have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, 
adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are 
primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and 
repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously 
monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – 

junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the 
frequency and severity of losses, such as residential mortgage – 
junior lien performance when the residential mortgage – first lien 
loan is delinquent. 

The decrease in the residential mortgage – junior lien 
portfolio at June 30, 2021, compared with December 31, 2020, 
reflected loan paydowns.  Table 16 shows certain delinquency 
and loss information for the residential mortgage – junior lien 
portfolio and lists the top five states by outstanding balance.

As of June 30, 2021, with respect to loans in the residential 

CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first 

mortgage – junior lien portfolio that had a CLTV ratio in excess of 
100%: 
• 

such loans totaled 2% of the outstanding balance of the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio; 
3% were 30 days or more past due. Customer payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies; and 
the unsecured portion (the outstanding amount that was in 
excess of the most recent property collateral value) of the 
outstanding balances of these loans totaled 1% of the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio. 

• 

• 

and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for 
credit line products) to property collateral value. For additional 
information on consumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 4.11 in 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to

Residential Mortgage – Junior Lien Line and Loan and 
Residential Mortgage – First Lien Line  Our junior lien, as well as 
first lien, lines of credit portfolios generally have draw periods of 
10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment 
options available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or 
(2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. 
As of June 30, 2021, lines of credit in a draw period primarily used 
the interest-only option. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 

increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only 
to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 17 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
residential mortgage – junior liens, including lines and loans, and 
residential mortgage – first lien lines segregated into scheduled 
end of draw or end-of-term periods and products that are 
currently amortizing, or in balloon repayment status. The 
unfunded credit commitments for residential mortgage – junior 
and first lien lines totaled $49.8 billion at June 30, 2021.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2030, with annual scheduled amounts through 2030 ranging from $914 million to $3.3 billion and averaging 
$1.7 billion per year. 
Includes $69 million of end-of-term balloon payments which were past due. 

At June 30, 2021, $339 million, or 2%, of lines in their draw 

period were 30 days or more past due, compared with 
$347 million, or 5%, of amortizing lines of credit. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies. On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment 
characteristics of borrowers in our residential mortgage – first 
and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In June 2021, excluding 
borrowers with COVID-related loan modification payment 
deferrals: 
• 

Approximately 43% of these borrowers paid only the 
minimum amount due and approximately 52% paid more 
than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 
delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. 
For the borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, 
approximately 28% paid only the minimum amount due and 
approximately 67% paid more than the minimum amount 
due.

CREDIT CARD  Our credit card portfolio totaled $34.9 billion at 
June 30, 2021, compared with $36.7 billion at December 31, 
2020. The decrease in the outstanding balance at June 30, 2021, 
compared with December 31, 2020, was due to seasonal 
paydowns. 

AUTO  Our auto portfolio totaled $51.1 billion at June 30, 2021, 
compared with $48.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The 
outstanding balance at June 30, 2021, compared with 
December 31, 2020, increased as originations exceeded 
paydowns. 

OTHER CONSUMER  Other consumer loans, which include 
revolving credit and installment loans, totaled $25.9 billion at 
June 30, 2021, compared with $24.4 billion at December 31, 
2020.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on foreclosed assets, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $1.2 billion from 

December 31, 2020, predominantly due to a decline in 
commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans, driven by a decrease 
in oil, gas, and pipeline nonaccrual loans, reflecting improvement 
in the economic environment. For additional information on 
commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Commercial and 
Industrial Loans and Lease Financing” section in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $127 million from 

December 31, 2020, driven by a decline in residential mortgage

Table 20 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 
that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 

Table 20:  Analysis of Changes in Nonaccrual Loans 

classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

We believe exposure to loss on nonaccrual loans is mitigated 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing financial 

difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan modification. 
Under our proprietary modification programs, customers may be 
required to provide updated documentation, and some programs 
require completion of payment during trial periods to demonstrate 
sustained performance before the loan can be removed from 
nonaccrual status. 

by the following factors at June 30, 2021: 
• 

96% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 93% are secured by real estate and 93% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
71% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 66% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain. 
of the $1.0 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$691 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered in developing our allowance for loan losses.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed autos. 

Foreclosed assets at June 30, 2021, included $49 million of 
foreclosed residential real estate, of which 30% is predominantly 
FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to have minimal or 
no loss content. The remaining amount of foreclosed assets has 
been written down to estimated net realizable value. Of the 
$129 million in foreclosed assets at June 30, 2021, 61% have 
been in the foreclosed assets portfolio for one year or less. 
As part of our actions to support customers during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended certain 
mortgage foreclosure activities, which has affected the amount 
of our foreclosed assets. For additional information on loans in 
process of foreclosure, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 22 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2020, due 
to paydowns and a $436 million transfer from residential 
mortgage – first lien loans to LHFS related to the sales of loans 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020. The 
amount of our TDRs at June 30, 2021, would have otherwise 
been higher without the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act 
and Interagency Statement.

In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire 
amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we 
delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal 
(principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance 
if that amount is not considered fully collectible. The allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs was $360 million and $565 million at 
June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. As part of 
our actions to support customers during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we have provided borrowers relief in the form of loan 
modifications. Under the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, loan modifications related to the COVID-19 
pandemic will not be classified as TDRs if they meet certain 
eligibility criteria. For additional information on the CARES Act 

and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality Overview – COVID-
Related Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 
For information on our nonaccrual policies when a 

restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Table 23 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 

(2)  Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held for sale. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market terms 

qualify as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 

(3)  Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 

modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 
90 days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) residential 
mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory 
rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, 
usually 120 days past due.

Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding 
government insured/guaranteed loans, at June 30, 2021, were up 
from December 31, 2020, due to an increase in delinquent 
commercial real estate mortgage loans and commercial and 
industrial loans, partially offset by a decline in delinquent 
consumer loans in line with the decrease in our total consumer 
loan portfolio. Customer payment deferral activities instituted in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of delinquencies for customers who would have 
otherwise moved into past due status. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 
repayments are largely insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the 
VA for mortgages at June 30, 2021, were down from 
December 31, 2020, largely due to transfers to LHFS related to 
the sales of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization

(1)  Quarterly net charge-offs as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in second 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

quarter 2021, compared with the prior quarter, was driven by 
lower charge-offs across the entire portfolio as well as higher 
recoveries in the CRE portfolio. 

The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in second 
quarter 2021, compared with the prior quarter, was driven by 
lower losses in other consumer loans due to the sale of a portion 
of our student loan portfolio in first quarter 2021. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of net loan 
charge-offs. For additional information on customer 
accommodations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see 
the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-
Related Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other 
off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for 
loans, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our ACL for debt securities, see the “Balance 
Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale and Held-To-Maturity Debt 
Securities” section and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Instruments (CECL) on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K. 
Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 26 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans decreased $3.3 billion, or 17%, from 
December 31, 2020, reflecting better portfolio credit quality and 
improvements in current and forecasted economic conditions. 
Total provision for credit losses for loans was $(1.2) billion in 
second quarter 2021, compared with $9.6 billion in the same 
period a year ago, reflecting lower net charge-offs and 
improvements in current and forecasted economic conditions. 
The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio 
segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is 
included in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 

estimate of the ACL for loans. The scenarios generally include a 
base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Our estimate of the ACL for 
loans at June 30, 2021, was based on a weighting of the base and 
a downside economic scenario of 50% and 50%, respectively, with 
no weighting applied to an upside scenario. The base scenario 
assumed economic improvements in the near term with a return 
to normalized levels near the end of 2022. The downside scenario 
assumed sustained adverse economic impacts resulting from the 

COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the base scenario. The 
downside scenario assumed U.S. real GDP growth rates decline in 
the first half of 2022 before returning to normalized levels after 
2023 and the U.S. unemployment rate increases through 2022 
and peaks in the first half of 2023. We considered within each 
scenario our expectations for the impact of customer 
accommodation activity, as well as the estimated impact on 
certain industries that we consider to be directly and most 
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In addition to quantitative estimates, we consider qualitative 

factors that represent risks inherent in our processes and 
assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling 
assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. We 
also considered the significant uncertainty related to the 
duration and severity of the economic impacts from the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the incremental risks to our loan 
portfolio. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at June 30 and March 31, 2021, are 
presented in Table 27.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
GDP), among other factors. We observed economic 
improvements in the first half of 2021; however, there remained 
significant uncertainty related to the length and severity of the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of 
other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and 
corresponding requirements for future amounts of the ACL, 
including the impact of economic stimulus programs and 
customer accommodation activity. The COVID-19 pandemic 
could continue to impact the recognition of credit losses in our 
loan portfolios and may result in increases in our ACL, particularly 
if the impact on the economy worsens. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $16.4 billion at June 30, 
2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including 
unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance 
is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. 
The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing 
factors as of the date of determination, including economic or 
market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination 
processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes 
in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we 
will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the 
balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is 
discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for 
Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2020 Form 
10-K. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  For 
information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability For Mortgage 
Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and 

private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for 
unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement of advances of 
delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. Due to payment deferrals provided as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of our servicing 
advances of principal and interest remained elevated. The 
amount of these advances may increase if additional payment 
deferrals are provided. Payment deferrals also delay the 
collection of contractually specified servicing fees, resulting in 
lower net servicing income. 

Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase 

loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which becomes 
exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid 
by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash 
and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. As a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our repurchases of these loans 
were elevated in 2020 but returned to more normalized levels in 
the first half of 2021. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Risks Relating to Servicing Activities” section in 
our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage 
banking activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For 
information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 
Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a 
slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

• 

interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 28, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and 
short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three 
years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 
0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for 
the scenarios presented in Table 28: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across 
the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The interest rate sensitivity included in Table 28 indicates 
that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our 
assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets 
would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. 

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by 
mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management 

– Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional 
information. For additional information on our trading assets and 
liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in our 2020 Form 10-K for additional information. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
additional information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. For information on 
our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk” section in our 2020 Form 
10-K. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For additional information on our 
monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market 
Risk – Trading Activities” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 29:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

Table 29 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 
category. The decrease in average Company Trading General VaR 
for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was driven by a greater presence of market 
volatility dropping out of the 12-month historical lookback 
window used to calculate average Company Trading General VaR 
for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. Market volatility present in 
average Company Trading General VaR for the quarter ended 
June 30, 2020, was driven by the introduction of the COVID-19 
pandemic, in particular, changes in interest rate curves and a 
significant widening of credit spreads.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

We also have marketable equity securities that include 

investments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair 
value changes in these marketable equity securities are 
recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 6 
(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To help achieve this objective, we monitor both 

the consolidated company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis 
to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, 
deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. The Parent acts as a source 
of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term 
debt and equity, and WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), provides 
funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the 
Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For 
additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, 
see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section 
in our 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on the IHC, 
see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and 
Related Matters” section in this Report. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC, that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization, such as 
Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), 
predominantly consisting of central bank deposits, government 
debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal 
agencies that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, in an 
amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows 
during a 30-day stress period. The LCR applies to the Company 
on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions 
(IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules 
issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as 
Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR became 
effective on July 1, 2021, and applies to the Company on a 
consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total assets of $10 billion 
or more. As of July 1, 2021, we were compliant with the NSFR 
requirement. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of June 30, 2021, the consolidated 
Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank 
West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100%, which is 
calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash outflows, as 
each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 30 presents the 
Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated LCR 
and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule 
requirements.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the 
exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 31, which also includes encumbered securities that are not 
included as available HQLA in the calculation of the LCR.

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 31, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. As of June 30, 2021, we also maintained 
approximately $222.7 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 169% and 158% of total 
loans at June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings. Table 32 shows selected information for short-term 
borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. We 
pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of Note 
12 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 

Table 33:  Maturity of Long-Term Debt 

same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may 
purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in 
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender 
offer, or otherwise. We issued $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion of 
long-term debt in the second quarter and first half of 2021, 
respectively. Table 33 provides the aggregate carrying value of 
long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) 
for the remainder of 2021 and the following years thereafter, as 
of June 30, 2021.

ratings methodology. On May 24, 2021, DBRS Morningstar 
confirmed our ratings and retained the negative ratings trend. 
On June 14, 2021, Fitch Ratings affirmed our ratings and 
retained the negative ratings outlook. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 Form 10-K for 

additional information regarding our credit ratings and the 
potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our 
liquidity and operations, as well as Note 14 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 

as of June 30, 2021, are presented in Table 34.

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

On April 22, 2021, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) 
affirmed our ratings and retained the negative ratings outlook. 
On July 12, 2021, Moody's upgraded the senior debt rating of the 
Company to A1 from A2 as a result of revisions to its bank

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. FHLB members are 
required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, the amount of any future investment in the capital

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at June 30, 
2021, increased $9.1 billion from December 31, 2020, 
predominantly as a result of $10.7 billion of Wells Fargo net 
income, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common and preferred 
stock dividends. During the first half of 2021, we issued 
$819 million of common stock, substantially all of which was 
issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. 
During the first half of 2021, we repurchased 53 million shares of 
common stock at a cost of $2.2 billion. For additional information 
about capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress 
Testing” section below. 

In the first half of 2021, we issued $4.6 billion of preferred 

stock and redeemed $4.9 billion of preferred stock, including the 
redemption of the remaining $350 million of our Preferred 
Stock, Series N, in June 2021. In July 2021, we issued 
$1.25 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series DD. For additional 
information, see Note 16 (Preferred Stock) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo. 
Our capital adequacy is assessed based on the lower of our risk-
based capital ratios calculated under the two approaches. The 
Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments. Table 35 and Table 36 present the 
risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company on a 
fully phased-in basis under the Standardized Approach and 
Advanced Approach, respectively, as of June 30, 2021.

Capital conservation buffer 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 35 and Table 36, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress. 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. The Company’s stress capital 
buffer for the period October 1, 2020, through September 30, 
2021, is 2.50%. The Company expects its stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, to be 
3.10%. The FRB has indicated that it will publish the final stress 
capital buffer for the period October 1, 2021, through 
September 30, 2022, for each BHC by August 31, 2021.

Capital Management (continued) 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also 

subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital 
surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually 
calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of 
the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our 
size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 
wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. We 
expect our G-SIB capital surcharge to decrease by 50 basis points 
to 1.50% beginning in first quarter 2022, subject to finalization in 
fourth quarter 2021. 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with transition requirements 
and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end of 2021. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 

Table 37:  Capital Components and Ratios (Fully Phased-In) 

according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Although we report certain capital amounts and 
ratios in accordance with transition requirements for bank 
regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our capital on a fully 
phased-in basis. For information about our capital requirements 
calculated in accordance with transition requirements, see 
Note 23 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other 
Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 37 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, 

RWAs and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at June 30, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. Fully phased-in total capital 
amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures 
that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, 
investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s 
capital position. See Table 38 for information regarding the 
calculation and components of our CET1, tier 1 capital, total 
capital and RWAs, as well as a corresponding reconciliation to 
GAAP financial measures for our fully phased-in total capital 
amounts.

In second quarter 2021, we elected to change our accounting method for low-income housing tax credit investments and elected to change the presentation of investment tax credits related to solar 
energy investments. Prior period total equity was revised to conform with the current period presentation. Prior period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related metrics were not 
revised. 
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
At June 30, 2021, the impact of the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking regulators on our regulatory capital was an increase in capital of $879 million, reflecting a $991 million (post-
tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $7.5 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in tier 2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, in each case with any excess 
allowance for credit losses being deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
Includes an increase of $547 million under the Standardized Approach and a decrease of $1.4 billion under the Advanced Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on our excess 
allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2021. See footnote (4) to this table.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) 
tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; 
and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), 

which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of 
tangible common equity. The methodology of determining 
tangible common equity may differ among companies. 
Management believes that tangible book value per common 
share and return on average tangible common equity, which 
utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures 
because they enable management, investors, and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 41 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 42 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of June 30, 
2021.

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 
rules. For information regarding the proposed amendments to 
the SLR rules, see the “Capital Management – Leverage 
Requirements” section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

At June 30, 2021, the Company’s SLR was 7.09%, and each 

of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements. Table 43 
presents information regarding the calculation and components
of the Company’s SLR and tier 1 leverage ratio.

Adjustment represents derivatives and collateral netting exposures as defined for 
supplementary leverage ratio determination purposes. 
Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
June 30, 2021, are presented in Table 44.

based on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced 
Approaches. 
Total leverage exposure at December 31, 2020, reflected an interim final rule issued by the 
FRB that temporarily allowed a bank holding company to exclude on-balance sheet 
amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the 
calculation of its total leverage exposure.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For

section in this Report. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 100 
basis points above our regulatory requirement plus an 
incremental buffer of 25 to 50 basis points. Our capital targets 
are subject to change based on various factors, including changes 
to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large 
banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies, changes to the 
regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital 
actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

On March 25, 2021, the FRB announced that it was 

extending measures it previously announced limiting large BHCs, 
including Wells Fargo, from making any capital distribution 
(excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a 
capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a 
regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the FRB. 
The FRB generally authorized BHCs to (i) provided that the BHC 
does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends to

be larger than the level paid in second quarter 2020, pay 
common stock dividends and make share repurchases that, in the 
aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the 
BHC’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters; (ii) 
make share repurchases that equal the amount of share 
issuances related to expensed employee compensation; and (iii) 
redeem and make scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and 
tier 2 capital instruments. These limitations on capital 
distributions ended on June 30, 2021. 

Concurrently with CCAR, federal banking regulators also 

require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests 
to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to 
continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and 
financial conditions. 

In June 2021, the Company completed the 2021 CCAR 

stress test process. On July 27, 2021, the Board approved an 
increase to the Company's third quarter 2021 common stock 
dividend to $0.20 per share. Additionally, our capital plan includes 
gross common share repurchases of approximately $18 billion 
for the four-quarter period beginning third quarter 2021 through 
second quarter 2022. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 
amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At June 30, 2021, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 615 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during second quarter 2021, see Part II, Item 2 
in this Report. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. The 
following supplements our discussion of the other significant 
regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have 
affected or may affect our business contained in the “Regulatory 
Matters” and “Risk Factors” sections in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as 
“living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. 
Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a 
reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable 
period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the 
risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the 
financial stability of the United States. In addition to the 
Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare and 
periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements 
on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we 
adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any 
deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or 
operations. On June 29, 2021, we submitted our most recent 
resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. 

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 

important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 
default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), 
then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver 
and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s 
orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a 
company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are 
exposed to any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict 
priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
certain circumstances. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 

a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would likely 
be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, we are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry 
strategy, and the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an 
orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28,

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of 
options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or 
systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses 
and restore market confidence without extraordinary 
government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, 
transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or 
businesses. The Bank must also prepare and submit to the OCC a 
recovery plan that sets forth the Bank’s plan to remain a going 
concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or 
operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point 
where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or 
the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may 
impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us 
to divest assets. 

Regulatory Matters (continued) 

and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with 
WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and 
subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo 
Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC 
(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated 
from time to time as material entities for resolution planning 
purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time 
as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related 
Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including 
the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and 
intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its 
subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will 
continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time 
to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, 
the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide 
capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered 
Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support 
Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the 
Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of 
credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected 
to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating 
conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its 
debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other 
obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these 
arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ 
or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s 
board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the 
committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to 
pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which 
could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and 
its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could 
result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the 
Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if 
the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective 
obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, 
the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant 
to a related security agreement.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 

Current Accounting Developments 

The following significant accounting update has been issued by 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and is 
applicable to us, but is not yet effective:

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes;

goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. For additional information on these policies, see the 
“Critical Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2020 Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2020. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and

requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company, we refer you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K.
