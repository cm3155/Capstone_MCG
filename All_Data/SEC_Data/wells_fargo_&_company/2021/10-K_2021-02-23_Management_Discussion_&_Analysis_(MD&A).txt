Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets and proudly serves 
one in three U.S. households and more than 10% of all middle 
market companies in the U.S. We provide a diversified set of 
banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well 
as consumer and commercial finance, through our four 
reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, 
Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and 
Wealth and Investment Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 30 
on Fortune’s 2020 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We 
ranked fourth in both assets and in the market value of our 
common stock among all U.S. banks at December 31, 2020. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains meeting its regulatory 
requirements to build the right foundation for all that lies ahead. 
To do that, the Company is committing the resources necessary 
to ensure that we operate with the strongest business practices 
and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an 
appropriate culture in place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 
As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the 

34 

extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from 
the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received 
by the Company from loans made in connection with these 
programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to non-
profit organizations approved by the FRB that support small 
businesses. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party 
review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and 
sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a top priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. Our priority of rebuilding trust has 
included numerous actions focused on identifying potential 
financial harm to customers resulting from these matters and 
providing remediation. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal matters, see the “Risk Factors” 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
section and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Other Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 
identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the 
reasonably estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding 
trust efforts, which amounts may change based on additional 
facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and 
communications with our regulators. 

As our ongoing reviews continue, it is possible that in the 
future we may identify additional items or areas of potential 
concern. To the extent issues are identified, we will continue to 
assess any customer harm and provide remediation as 
appropriate. For additional information, including related legal 
and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section and Note 15 
(Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
CECL Adoption 
On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 
(ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
(CECL), which requires estimating an allowance for expected life-
time credit losses for loans and debt securities. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Efficiency Initiatives 
We are pursuing various initiatives to reduce expenses and create 
a more efficient and streamlined organization. Actions from 
these initiatives may include (i) reorganizing and simplifying 
business processes and structures to improve internal operations 
and the customer experience, (ii) reducing headcount, (iii) 
optimizing third-party spending, including for our technology 
infrastructure, and (iv) rationalizing our branch and 
administrative locations, which may include consolidations and 
closures. We have established teams in each of our lines of 
business and enterprise functions to focus on an organized and 
structured approach for implementing these initiatives. The 
evaluation of potential actions will continue in future periods. In 
2020, we recognized $1.5 billion of restructuring charges, 
predominantly personnel costs, within noninterest expense in 
our consolidated statement of income as a result of these 
initiatives. For additional information, see Note 22 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working 
diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry 
out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the 
public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help customers, 
employees and communities. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing 
forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans 
guaranteed under a new program called the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). The intent of the PPP is to provide loans to small 
businesses to keep their employees on the payroll and make 
certain other eligible payments. Loans granted under the PPP are 
guaranteed by the SBA and are fully forgivable if used for 
qualifying expenses such as payroll, mortgage interest, rent and 
utilities. If the loans are not forgiven, they must be repaid over a 
term not to exceed five years. Under the PPP, through 
December 31, 2020, we funded $10.5 billion in loans to 
approximately 194,000 borrowers and deferred approximately 
$420 million of SBA processing fees that will be recognized as 
interest income over the term of the loans. As of December 31, 
2020, $10.1 billion of principal remained outstanding on these 
PPP loans. We voluntarily committed to donate all of the gross 
processing fees received in 2020 from funding PPP loans. 
Through December 31, 2020, we donated approximately 
$85 million of these processing fees to non-profit organizations 
that support small businesses. We expect to donate the 
remaining amount of these fees through 2022. In January 2021, 
the SBA reopened the PPP for new and certain existing PPP 
borrowers, and we have begun to fund loans under this latest 
round of the PPP. 

SBA SIX-MONTH PAYMENT ASSISTANCE  Under the CARES Act, the 
SBA will make principal and interest payments on behalf of 
certain borrowers for six months. During 2020, over 20,000 of 
our lending customers were eligible for SBA payment assistance, 
and we received $402 million in payments from the SBA. 

CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT  On December 27, 2020, 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA) was signed 
into law. The CAA provides additional COVID-19 focused relief 
and extends or amends certain provisions of the CARES Act, 
including those related to the PPP and troubled debt 
restructurings (TDRs). 

Brexit 
With the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union 
(Brexit), our primary goal is to continue to serve our existing 
clients in the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as 
to continue to meet the needs of our domestic clients as they do 
business in those locations. We are leveraging our authorized 
bank in Ireland, our asset management entity in Luxembourg, 
and our broker-dealer in France to help serve clients in the 
European Union. For additional information on risks associated 
with Brexit, see the “Risk Factors” section in this Report. 

LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely-
referenced benchmark rate, which is published in five currencies 
and a range of tenors, and seeks to estimate the cost at which 
banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. The 
administrator of LIBOR, ICE Benchmark Administration, 
published a consultation in December 2020 regarding its 
intention to cease the publication of LIBOR after December 31, 
2021, with the exception of certain tenors of U.S. dollar (USD) 
LIBOR that it proposed would remain available for use in legacy 
contracts or as otherwise enumerated by financial regulators 
until June 30, 2023. We have a significant number of assets and 
liabilities referenced to LIBOR, such as commercial loans, 
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, derivatives, debt 

35 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overview (continued) 

securities, and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2020, we had 
approximately $475 billion of assets, consisting mostly of 
commercial loans, approximately $25 billion of liabilities, and 
approximately $350 billion of off-balance sheet commitments 
linked to LIBOR. These amounts exclude derivative assets and 
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 
2020, the notional amount of our LIBOR-linked interest rate 
derivative contracts was approximately $7 trillion, of which 
approximately $5 trillion related to contracts with central 
counterparty clearinghouses. Each of the LIBOR-linked amounts 
referenced above will vary in future periods as current contracts 
expire with potential replacement contracts using an alternative 
reference rate. As of December 31, 2020, USD LIBOR 
represented substantially all of the LIBOR-linked amounts 
referenced above. 

In an effort to mitigate the risks associated with a transition 

away from LIBOR, our LIBOR Transition Office (LTO) has 
undertaken initiatives to: (i) develop more robust fallback 
language and disclosures related to the LIBOR transition, (ii) 
develop a plan to seek to amend legacy contracts to reference 
such fallback language or alternative reference rates, (iii) launch 
and enhance systems to support new products, including 
mortgages, commercial loans, securities and derivatives linked to 
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and other alternative 
reference rates, (iv) develop and evaluate internal guidance, 
policies and procedures focused on the transition away from 
LIBOR to alternative reference rate products, and (v) prepare and 
disseminate internal and external communications regarding the 
LIBOR transition. 

In addition, our LTO is actively working with financial 
regulators, industry working groups (such as the Alternative 
Reference Rate Committee) and trade associations that are 
developing guidance to facilitate an orderly transition away from 
the use of LIBOR. We continue to assess the risks and related 
impacts associated with a transition away from LIBOR. See the 
“Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional information 
regarding the potential impact of LIBOR or any other referenced 
financial metric being significantly changed, replaced, or 
discontinued. 

On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04 – Facilitation of the Effects of 
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Update) that 
provides temporary relief from existing generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) accounting requirements for 
contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships 
impacted by reference rate reform activities. For additional 
information on the Update, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Capital Actions and Restrictions 
On December 18, 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (FRB) announced that it was extending, with 
certain adjustments, measures it announced on June 25, 2020, 
limiting capital distributions by large bank holding companies 
(BHCs), including Wells Fargo, subject to certain exceptions. For 
first quarter 2021, the FRB generally authorized, among other 
things, BHCs to pay common stock dividends and make share 
repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount 
equal to the average of the BHC’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters, so long as the BHC does not 
increase the amount of its common stock dividend from the level 
paid in second quarter 2020. For additional information about 
capital planning, including the FRB’s recent prohibition on capital 
distributions, see the “Capital Management – Capital Planning 
and Stress Testing” section in this Report. 

36 

In January 2021, the Board approved an increase in the 

Company’s authority to repurchase common stock by an 
additional 500 million shares. 

In January 2021, we issued $3.5 billion of our Preferred 
Stock, Series BB, and in February 2021, we issued $1.05 billion of 
our Preferred Stock, Series CC. Additionally, in February 2021, we 
announced the redemption of our Preferred Stock, Series I, 
Series P and Series W, and a partial redemption of our Preferred 
Stock, Series N, for an aggregate cost of $4.5 billion. The 
redemptions are scheduled to occur on March 15, 2021. 

Announced Business Divestiture 
On February 23, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell 
Wells Fargo Asset Management for a purchase price of 
$2.1 billion. As part of the transaction, we will own a 9.9% equity 
interest in the ongoing entity and continue to serve as a client 
and distribution partner. The transaction is expected to close in 
the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. 

Financial Performance 
In 2020, we generated $3.3 billion of net income and diluted 
earnings per common share (EPS) of $0.41, compared with 
$19.5 billion of net income and EPS of $4.05 in 2019. Financial 
performance for 2020, compared with 2019, was impacted by an 
increase of $11.4 billion to our provision for credit losses 
reflecting the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
$1.5 billion of restructuring charges as a result of our efficiency 
initiatives. Also, in 2020 compared with 2019: 
• 

total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income, 
lower other noninterest income related to gains on the sales 
of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, our Institutional 
Retirement and Trust (IRT) business and Eastdil Secured 
(Eastdil) in 2019, and lower net gains from equity securities; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses, advertising and promotion expense, other expense, 
and personnel expense, partially offset by higher 
restructuring charges; 
average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in the residential mortgage – junior lien 
portfolio and the reclassification of student loans, included 
in other consumer loans, to loans held for sale (LHFS) after 
the announced sale of the portfolio in fourth quarter 2020; 
and 
average deposits increased on growth in interest-bearing 
and noninterest-bearing deposits driven by Consumer 
Banking and Lending and Wealth and Investment 
Management.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in 2020, with total 
equity of $185.9 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with 
$188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. Our liquidity and regulatory 
capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 2020, including: 
• 

our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 133%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%; 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.59%, which 
continued to exceed both the regulatory requirement of 9% 
and our current internal target of 10%; and 
our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.74%, 
compared with the regulatory requirement of 22.0%.

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity and Funding” sections in 
this Report for additional information regarding our capital and

liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory capital and 
liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality was affected by the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on our customer base. 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$19.7 billion at December 31, 2020, increased $9.3 billion 
from December 31, 2019. The change in the ACL for loans 
during 2020 was comprised of a $10.6 billion increase in the 
ACL for loans during 2020, partially offset by a $1.3 billion 
decrease as a result of our adoption of CECL on January 1, 
2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $14.0 billion in 
2020, up from $2.7 billion in 2019. The increase in the ACL 
for loans and the provision for credit losses in 2020 reflected 
current and forecasted economic conditions due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on borrower 
performance. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 2.22% at 
December 31, 2020, compared with 1.09% at December 31, 
2019. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $1.6 billion, 
or 31 basis points of average commercial loans, in 2020,

compared with net loan charge-offs of $652 million, or 
13 basis points, in 2019, predominantly driven by increased 
losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio primarily 
within the oil, gas and pipelines portfolio, and in our 
commercial real estate mortgage loan portfolio. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $1.7 billion, or 
39 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2020, 
compared with net loan charge-offs of $2.1 billion, or 
48 basis points, in 2019, predominantly driven by lower 
losses in our credit card, auto and other consumer loan 
portfolios as a result of payment deferral activities 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $8.9 billion at 

December 31, 2020, increased $3.2 billion, or 57%, from 
December 31, 2019, predominantly driven by increases in 
commercial and industrial, commercial real estate mortgage, 
and residential mortgage – first lien nonaccrual loans, 
reflecting the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
NPAs represented 1.00% of total loans at December 31, 
2020.

Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss) divided by average assets. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity. 
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may 
differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the 
“Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
See the “Capital Management” section and Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
The risk-based capital ratios were calculated under the lower of the Standardized or Advanced Approach determined pursuant to Basel III. Beginning January 1, 2018, the requirements for calculating 
common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets, became fully phased-in. Accordingly, the information presented reflects fully phased-in common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 
capital and risk-weighted assets, but reflects total capital still in accordance with Transition Requirements. See the “Capital Management” section and Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and 
Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared per common share as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share. 
Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for 2020 was $3.3 billion ($0.41 diluted 
EPS), compared with $19.5 billion ($4.05 diluted EPS) for 2019. 
Net income decreased in 2020, compared with 2019, 
predominantly due to a $11.4 billion increase in provision for 
credit losses, a $7.4 billion decrease in net interest income, and a 
$5.3 billion decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a 
$7.2 billion decrease in income tax expense. 

For a discussion of our 2019 financial results, compared with 

2018, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. 

Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio 
and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources 
of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and 
collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from 
period to period. 

Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in 
2020, compared with 2019, driven by unfavorable impacts of 
repricing due to the lower interest rate environment and higher 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization. 

Table 3 presents the individual components of net interest 
income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and the
net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis
in Table 3 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21%
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 
2020, 2019 and 2018.

The average balance amounts represent amortized costs. The interest rates are based on interest income or expense amounts for the period. Interest rates and amounts include the effects of hedge 
and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories. 
In fourth quarter 2020, loans held for sale and mortgage loans held for sale were combined into a single line item. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period 
presentation. 

(3)  Nonaccrual loans and any related income are included in their respective loan categories.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Table 4 allocates the changes in net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or 
average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume 
and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely 

allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, 
changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are 
allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based on the 
absolute value of the change due to average volume and average 
rate.

Deposit-related fees decreased driven by: 
• 

lower customer transaction volumes and higher average 
consumer deposit account balances due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to 
support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by a lower earnings credit rate due to the lower 
interest rate environment. 

Lending-related fees decreased driven by an increase in fee 
waivers and reversals as part of our actions to support customers 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Brokerage fees increased reflecting higher asset-based fees, 
partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Asset-based fees 
include fees from advisory accounts that are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter. 

Trust and investment management fees decreased driven by 
lower trust fees due to the sale of our Institutional Retirement 
and Trust (IRT) business in 2019. 

Our assets under management (AUM), excluding IRT client 
assets, totaled $786.6 billion at December 31, 2020, compared 
with $684.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Substantially all of our 
AUM is managed by our Wealth and Investment Management 
(WIM) operating segment. Our assets under administration 
(AUA), excluding IRT client assets, totaled $942.4 billion at 
December 31, 2020, and $898.0 billion at December 31, 2019. 
Our AUA is managed by our WIM operating segment and our 
Corporate and Investment Banking operating segment. 
Management believes that AUM and AUA are useful metrics 
because they allow investors and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees.

Card fees decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower interchange fees, net of rewards costs, driven by 
decreased credit card purchase volumes and debit card 
transaction volumes due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
higher fee waivers as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

• 

Servicing income, net decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others and the impacts of customer accommodations 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher unreimbursed servicing costs associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower mortgage servicing right (MSR) valuation losses, net 
of hedge results, as gains from favorable hedge results more 
than offset valuation adjustments for higher expected 
servicing costs and prepayment estimates due to changes in 
economic and market conditions. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales increased 
driven by: 
• 

higher residential real estate held for sale (HFS) origination 
volumes; and 
higher margins in both our retail and correspondent 
production channels, as well as a shift to more retail 
origination volume, which has a higher margin. 

• 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting: 
• 

higher volumes in interest rate products due to lower 
interest rates; 
higher volumes and customer activity for equities trading 
due to volatility in the equity markets; and

by higher unrealized gains on securities accounted for under 
the measurement alternative, both of which included the 
impact of a change in the accounting measurement model 
for certain nonmarketable equity securities from our 
affiliated venture capital partnerships. 

Lease income decreased due to a reduction in the size of the 
operating lease asset portfolio. 

Other income decreased due to gains in 2019 of: 
• 
• 
• 

$1.6 billion on the sales of PCI loans; 
$1.1 billion on the sale of our IRT business; and 
$362 million on the sale of Eastdil, which also resulted in a 
decline in commercial real estate brokerage commissions in 
2020; 

partially offset by: 
• 

gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans reclassified 
to held for sale in 2019 and sold in 2020.

Table 6a presents results for our deferred compensation 
plan and related hedges. In second quarter 2020, we entered 
into arrangements to transition our economic hedges of the 
deferred compensation plan liabilities from equity securities to 
derivative instruments. As a result of this transition, changes in 
fair value of derivatives used to economically hedge the deferred 
compensation plan are reported in personnel expense rather 
than in net gains (losses) from equity securities within 
noninterest income. For additional information on the 
derivatives used in the economic hedges, see Note 16 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

• 

higher volumes for credit trading due to additional market 
liquidity from government actions in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic; 

partially offset by: 
• 

losses due to higher prepayment speeds on agency MBS 
pools, net of hedge gains, and wider credit spreads for non-
agency and certain asset-backed securities. 

Net gains on debt securities increased due to higher gains from 
the sales of agency MBS as a result of portfolio re-balancing and 
actions taken to manage under the asset cap. 

Net gains from equity securities decreased driven by: 
• 

lower unrealized gains on deferred compensation plan 
investments (largely offset in personnel expense). Refer to 
Table 6a for the results for our deferred compensation plan 
and related investments; 
lower realized gains on nonmarketable equity securities; and 
impairment on equity securities of $1.7 billion due to the 
market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset

software impairments in 2019; and

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
decreased due to: 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 
• 

higher technology contracts expense; and 
higher telecommunications expense related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Occupancy expense increased due to additional cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

• 

Other expenses decreased driven by: 
• 

a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
lower foreclosed assets expense due to the suspension of 
certain mortgage foreclosure activities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 
• 

higher pension plan settlement expenses; 
higher charitable donations expense driven by the donation 
of PPP processing fees; and 
higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 
deposit assessment expense driven by both a higher 
assessment rate and a higher deposit assessment base. 

lower expense for litigation accruals; 

Operating losses decreased driven by: 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher expense for customer remediation accruals primarily 
reflecting expansions of the population of affected 
customers, remediation payments, and/or remediation time 
frames for a variety of matters. 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by 
reduced marketing and brand campaign volumes due to the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Restructuring charges increased driven predominantly by 
personnel costs, as well as facility closure costs, related to our 
efficiency initiatives that commenced in third quarter 2020. For 
additional information on restructuring charges, see Note 22 
(Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax benefit was $3.0 billion in 2020, compared with 
income tax expense of $4.2 billion in 2019, driven by lower pre-
tax income. The effective income tax rate was (1,016)% for 2020, 
compared with 17.5% for 2019. The effective income tax rate for 
2020 reflected the impact of income tax benefits (including tax 
credits) on lower pre-tax income and included income tax 
benefits related to the resolution and reevaluation of prior period 
matters with U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The effective 
income tax rate for 2019 included the impact of certain litigation 
accruals that were not deductible for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. For additional information on income taxes, see 
Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
We reorganized our management reporting into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 7. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income 
from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

Prior period reportable operating segment results have been 

revised to reflect the reorganization of our management 
reporting structure. The reorganization did not impact the 
previously reported consolidated financial results of the 
Company. As a result of the reorganization, we have included a 
discussion of our 2019 financial results, compared with 2018, for 
each of our reportable operating segments and for Corporate. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Table 7:  Management Reporting Structure 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, net of 
allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital 
and private equity partnerships. Corporate also includes certain lines of business that management has determined are no longer consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company, 
including our student loan and rail car leasing businesses, as well as previously divested businesses. 
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due status. 
Excludes certain private label new account openings.

Full year 2020 vs. full year 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment; 
lower deposit-related fees driven by higher average 
consumer deposit account balances due to the economic 
slowdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well 
as fee waivers and reversals as part of our actions to support 
customers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
lower card fees driven by lower credit card purchase volumes 
and lower debit card transaction volumes; and 
lower other income driven by higher gains in 2019 related to 
sales of PCI loans; 

• 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher mortgage banking revenue driven by increased net 
gains on mortgage loan originations/sales reflecting higher 
real estate HFS origination volumes and higher margins. 

• 

• 

Provision for credit losses increased driven by weakened 
economic conditions due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Noninterest expense was largely unchanged reflecting: 
• 

a decline in personnel expense due to lower headcount and 
lower incentive compensation expense; 
lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; and 
lower advertising and promotion expense; 

• 

• 
offset by: 
• 

an increase in employee benefits expense related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including additional payments to 
certain customer-facing and support employees and for 
back-up childcare services; 
higher occupancy expense due to additional cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expense related to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
higher charitable donations expense due to the donation of 
PPP processing fees.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Full year 2019 vs. full year 2018 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment; 
lower noninterest income reflecting a decrease in mortgage 
banking fees driven by lower net servicing fees due to higher 
prepayments and sales of mortgage servicing rights; and 
lower other income driven by higher gains in 2018 related to 
sales of PCI loans; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher deposit-related fees driven by higher customer 
transaction volumes; and 
higher card fees driven by higher credit card purchase 
volumes and higher debit card transaction volumes. 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 
• 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher operating losses due to higher expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; 
higher incentive compensation expense; 
higher advertising and promotion expense; and 
higher expenses allocated from enterprise functions, 
reflecting additional risk management and technology 
support; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower core deposit intangibles expense reflecting the end of 
the 10-year amortization period on Wachovia intangibles in 
2018; and 
lower FDIC deposit assessment expense due to the 
termination of the FDIC temporary assessment effective 
October 1, 2018. 

• 

Provision for credit losses increased due to a lower level of 
credit quality improvement, partially offset by lower net charge-
offs in the auto portfolio.

Total loans (period-end) decreased as growth in small business 
loans driven by loans funded under the PPP was more than offset 
by paydowns exceeding originations in the home lending, credit 
card and personal lending portfolios. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
government stimulus programs and lower consumer spending 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Total deposits (period-end) increased driven by growth in 
consumer and small business banking deposits and higher 
mortgage escrow deposits reflecting an inflow of higher 
mortgage payoffs to be remitted to investors in accordance with 
servicing contracts.

partially offset by: 
• 

higher expenses allocated from enterprise functions 
reflecting additional risk management and technology 
support.

Total loans (average and period-end) decreased driven by lower 
loan demand, including lower line utilization, and higher 
paydowns reflecting continued client liquidity and strength in the 
capital markets. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased due to 
customers’ preferences for liquidity given the economic 
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
government stimulus programs, and lower investment spending. 

Total deposits (average) decreased driven by market pricing 
changes for commercial deposits.

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment and lower deposit balances; and 
lower commercial mortgage banking fees and related hedge 
income; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher net gains from trading activities driven by higher 
interest rate product trading volumes due to lower interest 
rates, higher equities trading volumes and customer activity 
due to volatility in the equity markets, and higher credit 
trading volumes due to additional market liquidity from 
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
partially offset by losses due to higher prepayments on 
agency MBS pools, net of hedge gains, and wider credit 
spreads for non-agency and certain asset-backed securities; 
and 
higher investment banking fees due to increased debt and 
equities originations within our Investment Banking 
business, partially offset by lower advisory fees.

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting economic 
uncertainty due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 
Commercial Real Estate business and oil and gas portfolio. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher operating losses due to higher expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; 
higher occupancy expense due to additional cleaning fees, 
supplies, and equipment expenses related to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
higher expenses allocated from enterprise functions 
reflecting risk management support, as well as investments 
in our operations and treasury management product 
services infrastructure; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

a reduction in business travel and company events due to 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Full year 2019 vs. full year 2018 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher trading volumes for rates and commodities, credit 
and residential mortgage-backed securities, partially offset 
by lower equity and foreign exchange trading income; and 
higher investment banking fees due to increased debt 
originations and higher advisory fees, partially offset by 
lower asset-backed finance securitization fees; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income due to lower spreads on trading 
debt securities, loans, and deposits. 

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting lower recoveries 
and higher loan losses in our oil and gas portfolio. 

Table 8f:  Corporate and Investment Banking – Balance Sheet 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; and 
lower FDIC deposit assessment expense due to the 
termination of the FDIC temporary assessment effective 
October 1, 2018; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher expenses allocated from enterprise functions 
reflecting risk management support, as well as investments 
in technology, operations, and treasury management 
product services infrastructure.

Total assets (period-end) decreased predominantly due to a 
decline in loan balances driven by lower loan demand and higher 
paydowns reflecting continued client liquidity and strength in the 
capital markets, as well as a decline in trading-related assets 
reflecting continued actions to manage under the asset cap. 

Total deposits (period-end) decreased reflecting continued 
actions to manage under the asset cap.

Total assets (average and period-end) increased driven by 
growth in commercial and industrial loans and trading-related 
assets reflecting increased customer activity. 

Total deposits (period-end) increased driven by growth in 
Commercial Real Estate and Markets.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

Represents annualized total revenue (excluding Wells Fargo Asset Management) divided by average total financial and wealth advisors for the period. 

Full year 2020 vs. full year 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher average deposit 
balances; and 
net losses from equity securities driven by a decline in 
deferred compensation plan investment results (largely 
offset by lower personnel expense); 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher asset-based brokerage fees. 

Provision for credit losses increased due to current and 
forecasted economic conditions due to the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; 
lower technology, telecommunications and equipment 
expense driven by impairments of capitalized software in 

• 

2019 reflecting a reevaluation of software under 
development, and the reversal of an accrual for software 
costs in 2020; and 
lower deferred compensation plan expense and lower 
incentive compensation expense; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher financial advisor commissions expense due to higher 
brokerage fees. 

Total loans (average and period-end) increased driven by 
growth in residential mortgage loans. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased primarily due 
to growth in brokerage clients’ cash balances. 

Full year 2019 vs. full year 2018 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting lower average deposit 
balances;

Earnings Performance (continued) 

• 

• 

lower brokerage fees driven by lower asset-based fees and 
retail brokerage transactional activity; and 
lower trust and investment fees reflecting the sale of our IRT 
business in 2019; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher net gains from equity securities driven by an increase 
in deferred compensation plan investment results (largely 
offset by higher personnel expense), as well as an 
impairment in 2018 related to the sale of our ownership 
stake in The Rock Creek Group, LP (RockCreek). 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher deferred 
compensation plan expense (largely offset by net gains from 
equity securities); 
higher technology, telecommunications and equipment 
expense driven by impairments of capitalized software in 
2019 reflecting a reevaluation of software under 
development; and 
higher operating losses due to higher expense for litigation 
and customer remediation accruals; 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower core deposit and other intangibles expense. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased as 
customers allocated more cash into higher yielding liquid 
alternatives. 

Table 8h:  WIM Advisory Assets 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 8h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business for the years ended 
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Management believes that 
advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, 
investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts 
may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. 

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 

the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 
basis points.

Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) Assets Under 
Management  We earn trust and investment management fees 
from managing and administering assets through WFAM, which 
offers Wells Fargo proprietary mutual funds and manages 
institutional separate accounts. Generally, our trust and 
investment management fee income is earned from AUM where 
we have discretionary management authority over the 
investments and generate fees as a percentage of the market 
value of the AUM. WFAM assets under management consist of 

Table 8i:  WFAM Assets Under Management 

equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money market, and 
stable value, and include client assets that are managed or sub-
advised on behalf of other Wells Fargo lines of business. Table 8i 
presents WFAM AUM activity for the years ended December 31, 
2020, 2019 and 2018. Management believes that AUM is a 
useful metric because it allows management, investors, and

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, 
net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, 
liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable 
operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and 
affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. In 
addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to 
efficiency initiatives, as well as the headcount for approximately 
2,800 employees who have been notified of displacement and 
were previously included in the reportable operating segments. 

Corporate also includes certain lines of business that 
management has determined are no longer consistent with the 
long-term strategic goals of the Company, including our student 
loan and rail car leasing businesses, as well as previously divested 
businesses. Our rail car leasing business has long-lived operating 
lease assets (as a lessor) that can result in future impairments 
based on changing economic and market conditions affecting 
long-term demand for specific types of rail cars. Table 8j and

Full year 2020 vs. full year 2019 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, higher prepayments on debt securities, and a 

• 

reduction in the investment portfolio due to actions taken to 
manage under the asset cap; 
lower gains reflecting gains in 2019 of $1.1 billion on the 
sale of our IRT business and $362 million on the sale of 
Eastdil, which also resulted in a decline in trust and

Earnings Performance (continued) 

• 

investment management fees and commercial real estate 
brokerage commissions in 2020; and 
lower net gains on equity securities from our affiliated 
venture capital partnerships, as well as a decline in deferred 
compensation plan investment results (largely offset by 
lower personnel expense); 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher gains on debt securities due to portfolio re-balancing 
and actions taken to manage under the asset cap. 

Provision for credit losses decreased due to a reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses as a result of the reclassification of 
student loans to loans held for sale after the announced sale of 
the portfolio in fourth quarter 2020. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher restructuring charges driven predominantly by 
personnel costs, as well as facility closure costs, related to 
our efficiency initiatives that commenced in third quarter 
2020. All restructuring charges were included in Corporate. 
For additional information on restructuring charges, see 
Note 22 (Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in 
this Report; and 
increased operating losses due to higher expense for 
litigation and customer remediation accruals; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 
• 

lower deferred compensation expense; and 
lower expenses related to businesses that were divested in 
2019. 

Full year 2019 vs. full year 2018 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

gains in 2019 of $1.1 billion on the sale of our IRT business 
and $362 million on the sale of Eastdil, partially offset by a 
gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services in 2018; 
and 
higher net gains from equity securities driven by an increase 
in deferred compensation plan investment results (largely 
offset by higher personnel expense); 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income related to businesses that were 
divested in 2018. 

Provision for credit losses increased due to a reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses as a result of the sale of Reliable 
Financial Services, Inc. in 2018. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

increased operating losses due to higher expense for 
litigation accruals, partially offset by lower expense for 
customer remediation accruals; and 
higher deferred compensation expense; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower lease expense in the rail car leasing business due to 
portfolio run-off. 

Corporate includes AUM and AUA for IRT client assets of 
$22 billion and $700 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020, 
which we continue to administer at the direction of the buyer 
pursuant to a transition services agreement. The transition 
services agreement has been extended and will now terminate no 
later than December 2021.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At December 31, 2020, our assets totaled $1.96 trillion, up 
$27.6 billion from December 31, 2019. 

The following discussion provides additional information 
about the major components of our consolidated balance sheet.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $28 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $41 million related to held-to-maturity debt 
securities at December 31, 2020. The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities was $0 at December 31, 2019, due to our adoption of CECL on 
January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, subsequent to the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. 

Table 9 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in 
available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. The size and composition of our AFS and HTM debt 
securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity and interest 
rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt securities 
portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the 
normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in 
our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall 
economic or market conditions, which could influence loan 
origination demand, prepayment speeds, or deposit balances and 
mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be 
rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk 
management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and 
interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt 
securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other 
short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for more information on 
liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The AFS debt securities portfolio primarily consists of liquid, 

high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and agency 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The portfolio also includes 
securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions, non-
U.S. government securities, and highly rated collateralized loan 
obligations (CLOs). The fair value of AFS debt securities 
decreased from December 31, 2019, as purchases were more 
than offset by runoff, sales and transfers to HTM debt securities 
due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital 
management purposes. 

The HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. 
states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Our 
intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the 
contractual cash flows. Debt securities are classified as HTM

through purchases or through transfers from the AFS debt 
securities portfolio. The net amortized cost of HTM debt 
securities increased from December 31, 2019, as purchases and 
transfers from AFS debt securities were partially offset by runoff. 

At December 31, 2020, 92% of the combined AFS and HTM 

debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are 
based on external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based on internal credit grades. 

The total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt 
securities increased from December 31, 2019, driven by lower 
interest rates. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on AFS and HTM debt securities, 
including a summary of debt securities by security type. 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 10 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans decreased from 
December 31, 2019, driven by: 
• 

lower demand for originations of new loans and lower 
utilization on existing revolving loans in commercial and 
industrial loans; and 
loan paydowns on continued customer liquidity from 
strength in capital markets. 

• 

Consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2019, due to: 
• 

paydowns exceeding originations in first and junior lien 
mortgage loans; and 
lower consumer spending and originations in credit cards; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

the repurchase of $30.0 billion of first lien mortgage loans 
from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) 
loan securitization pools.

Average loan balances and a comparative detail of average 

loan balances is included in Table 3 under “Earnings Performance 
– Net Interest Income” earlier in this Report. Additional 
information on total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and 
class of financing receivable is included in the “Risk Management

Deposits 
Deposits increased from December 31, 2019, reflecting: 
• 

consumer and wealth customers’ preferences for liquidity 
given the economic uncertainty associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic, loan payment deferrals, government 
stimulus programs, and lower customer spending; and 
an increase in mortgage escrow deposits reflecting an inflow 
of mortgage payoffs to be remitted to investors in 
accordance with servicing contracts; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in 
declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of 
deposit (CDs), and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. 
offices.

In fourth quarter 2020, we ceased the reclassification of 

certain transactional demand deposit balances to non-
transactional deposit balances based on a final rule issued by the 
FRB, which amended the FRB reserve requirements of depository 
institutions. As a result, approximately $380 billion of balances 
were classified as interest-bearing demand deposits, which were 
previously classified as savings deposits. 

Table 12 provides additional information regarding 
deposits. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net 
interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is 
provided in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” 
section and Table 3 earlier in this Report.

Equity 
Total equity was $185.9 billion at December 31, 2020, compared 
with $188.0 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease was 
driven by: 
• 

common stock repurchases of $3.4 billion (substantially all 
of which occurred in first quarter 2020); and 
dividends of $6.3 billion; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 
• 

net income of $3.3 billion; and 
issuances of common stock of $2.7 billion predominantly 
related to employee stock ownership plans.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity 
securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, 
derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are 
designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) 
manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify 
our funding sources. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, 
we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, direct pay 
letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange 
and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types 
of similar arrangements. For additional information, see Note 13 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

Risk is Part of our Business Model.  The Company measures and 
manages risk as part of our business, including in connection with 
the products and services we offer to our customers. The risks we 
take include financial, such as credit, interest rate, market, 
liquidity and funding risks, and non-financial, such as operational 
including compliance and model risks, strategic and reputation 
risks. 

Risk Profile.  Our risk profile is a holistic view of all risks we hold 
at a point in time, including emerging risks. The Company 
monitors its risk profile, and the Board periodically reviews 
reports and analysis concerning our risk profile. 

Risk Capacity.  Risk capacity refers to the maximum level of risk 
that the Company could assume given its current level of 
resources before triggering regulatory and other constraints on 
its capital and liquidity needs. 

Risk Appetite.  Management defines and the Board approves the 
Company’s risk appetite, which is the amount of risk the 
Company is comfortable taking given its current level of 
resources. Risk appetite defines which risks are acceptable and at 
what level and guides business and risk leaders. Risk appetite 
boundaries are set within the Company’s risk capacity. The 
Company’s risk appetite is articulated in a statement of risk 
appetite, which is approved at least annually by the Board. The 
Company continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board 
reviews periodic risk appetite reports and analysis. 

Risk and Strategy.  The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk 
appetite, and risk management effectiveness (i.e., the holistic 
measure of the quality and effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management activities, including the functional or programmatic 
use of controls and capabilities to manage risks) are considered in 
the strategic planning process, which is closely linked with the 
Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent 
Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic 
planning at several points in the process, providing challenge to 
and independent assessment of the Company’s self-assessment 
of the risks associated with strategic planning initiatives. IRM 
also independently assesses the impact of the strategic plan on 
risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness at 
the principal line of business, enterprise function, and aggregate 
Company level. After review by management, the strategic plan 
is presented to the Board each year for review and approval. 

Everyone Manages Risk.  Every employee creates risk in the 
course of performing business activities and is required to 
manage that risk. Risk is everyone’s responsibility. Every 
employee is required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, 
and Company policies. 

Risk and Culture.  Senior management sets the “tone at the top” 
by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s 
expectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves, 
work with colleagues, and make decisions. The Board holds senior 
management accountable for establishing and maintaining the 

60 

right culture and effectively managing risk. Employees are 
strongly encouraged and expected to speak up when they see 
something that could cause harm to the Company’s customers, 
communities, employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because 
risk management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are 
expected to challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to 
escalate their concerns when they have not been addressed. 
Employee performance evaluations are tied to, and take into 
account, effective risk management. The Company’s 
performance management and incentive compensation 
programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk 
and reward under core principles that employees are expected to 
know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources 
Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing 
credible challenge to the Company’s performance management 
and incentive compensation programs. 

Risk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk 
management framework sets forth the core principles on how 
the Company seeks to manage and govern its risk. Many 
Company policies and documents anchor to the risk 
management framework’s core principles. The Board’s Risk 
Committee annually reviews and approves the risk management 
framework. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by 
building the right risk and control infrastructure. We continue to 
enhance our risk management programs, including our 
operational and compliance risk management as required by the 
FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, 
consent orders. 

Risk Governance 
Role of the Board.  The Board oversees the Company’s business, 
including its risk management. The Board assesses 
management’s performance, provides credible challenge, and 
holds management accountable for maintaining an effective risk 
management program and for adhering to risk management 
expectations. 

Board Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk 
oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. 
The Risk Committee approves the Company’s risk management 
framework and oversees its implementation, including the 
processes established by management to identify, assess, 
measure, monitor, and manage risks. It also monitors the 
Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk 
Committee oversees IRM and the performance of the Chief Risk 
Officer (CRO) who reports functionally to the Risk Committee 
and administratively to the CEO. 

Management Committee Structure.  The Company has 
established management committees, including those focused 
on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance 
and risk management responsibilities. One type of management 
committee is a governance committee, which is a decision 
making body that operates for a particular purpose. 

Each management governance committee is expected to 
discuss, document, and make decisions regarding significant risk 
issues, emerging risks, and risk acceptances; review and monitor 
progress related to critical and high-risk issues and remediation 
efforts within its scope, including lessons learned; and report key

The Audit Committee additionally oversees the internal audit function; external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and the disclosure framework for financial, regulatory and risk 
reports prepared for the Board, management, and bank regulatory agencies; and assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
Effective March 1, 2021, the Risk Committee will have primary oversight responsibility for credit risk and the Credit Committee will become a subcommittee of the Risk Committee. 

Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk 
Committee of the Board.  The Enterprise Risk & Control 
Committee (ERCC) governs the management of all risk types, 
including financial risks and non-financial risks. The ERCC 
receives information about risk and control events, addresses 
escalated risks and issues, actively oversees risk control, and 
provides regular updates to the Risk Committee regarding 
current and emerging risks and management’s assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management program. 
The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, with 

membership comprised of the CEOs of our five principal lines of 
business (Consumer and Small Business Banking, Consumer 
Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment 
Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management) and certain 
enterprise functions. The Chief Auditor or a designee attends all 
meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct escalation path to 
the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates market risks and 
issues and interest rate risks and issues to the Finance 
Committee and certain human capital risks and issues to the 
Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO has the 
authority to escalate risks and issues directly to the Board. Risks 
and issues are escalated to the ERCC in accordance with 
applicable policies and procedures governing escalations. 

Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a 
risk and control committee, which is a management governance 
committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its 
scope limited to the relevant principal line of business or 
enterprise function. The focus of these risk and control 
committees is on the risks that each principal line of business or 
enterprise function generates and is responsible for managing, 

and the controls each principal line of business or enterprise 
function is expected to have in place. 

In addition to each risk and control committee, management 

governance committees dedicated to specific risk types and risk 
topics also report to the ERCC to help provide more 
comprehensive governance of risks. 

Risk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities 
The Company has three lines of defense: the front line, 
Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. Our risk 
operating model creates necessary interaction, 
interdependencies, and ongoing engagement among the lines of 
defense: 
• 

Front Line  The front line, which is composed of our five 
principal lines of business and certain activities of enterprise 
functions, is the first line of defense. In the course of its 
business activities, the front line identifies, measures and 
assesses, manages, controls, monitors, and reports on risk 
associated with its business activities and balances risk and 
reward in decision making while remaining within the 
Company’s risk appetite. 
Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of 
defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk 
management program and provides oversight, including 
challenge to and independent assessment of the front line’s 
execution of its risk management responsibilities. 
Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is 
responsible for acting as an independent assurance function 
and validates that the risk management program is 
adequately designed and functioning effectively.

Risk Management (continued) 

Risk Type Classifications 
The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and 
ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs 
and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit 
the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, 
including emerging risk exposures. 

Operational Risk Management 
Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this 
section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems, or from external events. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including 
significant supporting programs and/or policies regarding the 
Company’s business resiliency and disaster recovery, data 
management, information security, technology, and third-party 
risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the 
Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant 
operational risk policies and oversees the Company’s operational 
risk management program. 

At the management level, Operational Risk Management, 

which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational 
risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and 
provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s 
oversight responsibilities include change management risk, 
human capital risk, technology risk, third-party risk, information 
risk management, information security risk, and data 
management risk. 

Information security is a significant operational risk for 
financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, and includes the risk 
arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction of information or information 
systems. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the 
Company’s information security risk management and cyber 
defense programs. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for information security risk and 
approves the Company’s information security program, which 
includes the information security policy and the cyber defense 
program. A Technology Subcommittee of the Risk Committee 
assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of technology, 
information security, and cybersecurity risks as well as data 
management risk. The Technology Subcommittee reviews and 
recommends to the Risk Committee for approval any significant 
programs and/or policies supporting information security risk 
(including cybersecurity risk), technology risk, and data 
management risk. The Technology Subcommittee reports to the 
Risk Committee and both provide updates to the full Board. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions continue to be 

the target of various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, 
including malware, ransomware, phishing, and denial-of-service, 
as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial 
institutions, potentially test their cybersecurity capabilities, 
commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other 
information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online 
applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-
based and other products and services provided by third parties, 
and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet causing the 
widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website 
performance. Wells Fargo has not experienced any material 
losses relating to these or other types of cyber attacks. 
Cybersecurity risk is a priority for Wells Fargo, and we continue 
to develop and enhance our controls, processes and systems in 
order to protect our networks, computers, software and data 

62 

from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Wells Fargo is also 
proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and working 
with other parties, including our third-party service providers and 
governmental agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and 
improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats. See the “Risk 
Factors” section in this Report for additional information 
regarding the risks associated with a failure or breach of our 
operational or security systems or infrastructure, including as a 
result of cyber attacks. 

Compliance Risk Management 
Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting 
from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and 
rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately 
address associated impacts, including to customers. Compliance 
risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, 
program requirements, procedures, and standards related to 
ethical principles applicable to the banking industry. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial 
crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s 
Risk Committee reviews and approves significant supporting 
compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs 
and oversees the Company’s compliance risk management and 
financial crimes risk management programs. 

Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of 

inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of 
employees or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, 
caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business 
practices. In connection with its oversight of conduct risk, the 
Board oversees the alignment of employee conduct to the 
Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility 
for conduct risk and risk management components of the 
Company’s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board’s 
Human Resources Committee include oversight of the 
Company’s culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, human 
capital management (including talent management and 
succession planning), performance management program, and 
incentive compensation risk management program. 

At the management level, the Compliance function, which is 

part of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company’s 
compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk 
Management, which is part of the Compliance function, oversees 
and monitors financial crimes risk. The Compliance function 
reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to 
compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Model Risk Management 
Model risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the 
potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based 
on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the 
Company’s model risk management policy, model governance, 
model performance, model issue remediation status, and 
adherence to model risk appetite metrics. 

At the management level, the Model Risk function, which is 

part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for model risk and is 
responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of model 
risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports to the 
CRO and provides periodic reports related to model risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity arising 
from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of 
strategic initiatives, or inadequate responses to changes in the 
external operating environment. 

The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic 

planning and oversees management’s development and 
implementation of and approves the Company’s strategic plan, 
and considers whether it is aligned with the Company’s risk 
appetite and risk management effectiveness. Management 
develops, executes and recommends significant strategic 
corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management’s 
proposals, including their impact on the Company’s risk profile 
and financial position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the 
adequacy of the Company’s strategic risk management program, 
including associated risk management practices, processes and 
controls. The Board’s Risk Committee also receives updates from 
management regarding new business initiatives activity and risks 
related to new or changing products, as appropriate. 

At the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight 

function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight function reports into 
the CRO and supports periodic reports related to strategic risk 
provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Reputation Risk Management 
Reputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that 
negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the 
Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely 
impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, 
cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. 
Stakeholders include employees, customers, communities, 
shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and 
media organizations. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for reputation risk, while each Board committee 
has reputation risk oversight responsibilities related to their 
primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives reports 
from management that help it monitor how effectively the 
Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the 
Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports 
from management relating to stakeholder perceptions of the 
Company. 

At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight 
function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight function reports 
into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to reputation 
risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. 

Effective March 1, 2021, the Board’s Risk Committee will 

have primary oversight responsibility for credit risk and the 
Credit Committee will become a subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part 
of IRM, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk 
reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to 

credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit 
Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio 
Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on 
our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

Reputation risk. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in 2020 was affected by 
the economic impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our 
customer base. In particular: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020, up 

from $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans increased to $4.8 billion at December 31, 
2020, compared with $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans increased to $3.9 billion at 
December 31, 2020, compared with $3.1 billion at 
December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.98% of 
total loans at December 31, 2020, compared with 0.56% at 
December 31, 2019. 

•  Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of our average 

• 

commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 0.31% and 
0.39%, respectively, in 2020, compared with 0.13% and 
0.48% in 2019. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were $78 million 
and $612 million in our commercial and consumer portfolios, 
respectively, at December 31, 2020, compared with 
$78 million and $855 million at December 31, 2019. 
•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $14.0 billion in 

• 

2020, compared with $2.7 billion in 2019. 
The ACL for loans increased to $19.7 billion, or 2.22% of 
total loans, at December 31, 2020, compared with 
$10.5 billion, or 1.09%, at December 31, 2019. 

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING RELIEF  The CARES Act provides 
banks optional, temporary relief from accounting for certain loan 
modifications as TDRs. The modifications must be related to the 
adverse effects of COVID-19, and certain other criteria are 
required to be met in order to apply the relief. In first quarter 
2020, we elected to apply the TDR relief provided by the CARES 
Act. On December 27, 2020, the CAA was signed into law which 
extended the expiration of the TDR relief to no later than 
January 1, 2022. 

On April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued the 
Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for 
Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the 
Coronavirus (Revised) (the Interagency Statement). The 
Interagency Statement provides additional TDR relief as it 
clarifies that it is not necessary to consider the impact of 
COVID-19 on the financial condition of a borrower in connection 
with short-term (e.g., six months or less) loan modifications 
related to COVID-19 provided the borrower is current at the date 
the modification program is implemented. For additional 
information regarding the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act 
and the clarifying TDR accounting guidance from the Interagency 
Statement, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The TDR relief provided under the CARES Act, as well as 
from the Interagency Statement, does not change our processes 
for monitoring the credit quality of our loan portfolios or for 
updating our measurement of the ACL for loans based on 
expected losses. 

Additionally, our election to apply the TDR relief provided by 

the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement impacts our 
regulatory capital ratios as these loan modifications related to 
COVID-19 are not adjusted to a higher risk-weighting normally 
required with TDR classification. 

64 

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations  During 2020, we 
provided accommodations to customers in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including fee reversals for consumer and 
small business banking customers, and payment deferrals, fee 
waivers, covenant waivers, and other expanded assistance for 
mortgage, credit card, auto, small business, personal and 
commercial lending customers. Certain foreclosure, collection 
and credit bureau reporting activities were also suspended. 
Additionally, we deferred rental payments on certain leased 
assets for which we are the lessor. 

Table 15 summarizes the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of 

consumer loans that received accommodations under loan 
modification programs established to assist customers with the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-related 
modifications) and that remained in a deferral period as of 
December 31, 2020. These amounts included accommodations 
made for customers with loans reported on our consolidated 
balance sheet and excluded accommodations made for 
customers with loans that we service for others. COVID-related 
modifications primarily included payment deferrals of principal, 
interest or both, as well as interest and fee waivers. As of 
December 31, 2020, $1.7 billion of unpaid principal balance of 
commercial loans were still in a deferral period, which 
represented less than 1% of our total outstanding commercial 
loans. 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of net charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual 
status for those customers who would have otherwise moved 
into past due or nonaccrual status. As of December 31, 2020, the 
COVID-related modification programs described in Table 15 
expired, except for the programs for residential mortgage loans. 
However, based on the terms of the modifications provided 
under the programs in Table 15, certain balances may remain in a 
deferral period during 2021. Customers requiring assistance 
after receiving payment deferrals under the programs described 
in Table 15 may be eligible to receive modifications consistent 
with those offered prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as 
interest rate reductions, term extensions, or principal 
forgiveness. Additional modifications provided to customers 
after their exit from COVID-related modification programs may 
be eligible for the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act and the 
Interagency Statement. 

As of December 31, 2020, substantially all of our consumer 

loans were current after exiting the deferral period. Customer 
loans that are not further modified upon exit from the deferral 
period may be placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off in 
accordance with our policies if customers are unable to resume 
making payments in accordance with the contractual terms of 
their agreement. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional 
information on our nonaccrual and charge-off policies. 

Of the total modifications granted during 2020, $6.9 billion 
of unpaid principal balance of consumer loans were classified as 
TDRs as of December 31, 2020, including $4.0 billion that were 
already classified as a TDR when the COVID-related modification 
was granted. 

For information related to loans that are classified as TDRs, 

see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report.

section in this Report. FHA/VA loans are entitled to payment deferrals of scheduled principal and interest up to a total of 12 months. 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  For 
purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $19.3 billion of the commercial and industrial loan 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2020, 
compared with $16.6 billion at December 31, 2019, reflecting 
increases driven by the oil, gas and pipelines, real estate and 
construction, entertainment and recreation, and technology, 
telecom and media categories due to the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The decrease in loan balances in the portfolio at 

December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, was 
driven by lower loan demand and higher paydowns reflecting 
continued customer liquidity and strength in the capital markets. 
Table 16 provides our commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing by industry. The industry categories are based on the 
North American Industry Classification System.

Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit. 
(2)  No other single industry had total loans in excess of $3.8 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 

concentration, is predominantly comprised of loans to 
investment firms, financial vehicles, and nonbank creditors. We 
had $80.0 billion and $75.9 billion of loans originated by our 
Asset Backed Finance (ABF) and Financial Institution Group (FIG) 
lines of business at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, 
respectively. These loans include: (i) loans to customers related 
to their subscription or capital calls, (ii) loans to nonbank lenders 
collateralized by commercial loans, and (iii) loans to originators or 
servicers of financial assets collateralized by residential real 
estate or other consumer loans such as credit cards, auto loans 
and leases, student loans and other financial assets eligible for 
the securitization market. These ABF and FIG loans are limited to 
a percentage of the value of the underlying financial assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. These ABF and FIG loans may also have other 
features to manage credit risk such as cross-collateralization, 
credit enhancements, and contractual re-margining of collateral 
supporting the loans. In addition, loans to financials except banks 
included CLOs in loan form, all of which were rated AA or above, 
of $7.9 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, respectively. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $7.5 billion and 

$9.2 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at December 31, 
2020 and 2019, respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines nonaccrual 
loans increased at December 31, 2020, compared with 
December 31, 2019, due to new downgrades to nonaccrual 
status in 2020. 

We continue to perform escalated credit monitoring for 

certain industries that we consider to be directly and 
most adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio also includes non-U.S. loans of $63.8 billion and 
$71.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

66 

Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. loans at 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, included: 
• 

$36.2 billion and $31.2 billion in the financials except banks 
category; 
$12.8 billion and $19.9 billion in the banks category; and 
$1.6 billion and $1.5 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines 
category.

Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of 

repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering 
into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to perform under the 
agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to 
thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide 
additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or 
additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of 
collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to 
repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside 
repayment guarantee in providing the extension. 

Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly 

related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and 
willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 
more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with 
the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance 
for credit losses methodology. 

In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate the 

collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated

support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the strength 
of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full 
repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely 
collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the 
performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual 
status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in 
accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net 
realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory 
definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized 
segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful and 
loss categories. We had $12.0 billion of CRE mortgage loans and 
$1.6 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized at 
December 31, 2020, compared with $3.8 billion and $187 million, 
respectively, at December 31, 2019. The increase in criticized 
CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans was driven by the 
hotel/motel, shopping center, and retail (excluding shopping 

Table 17:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

center) property types and reflected the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the significant uncertainty related 
to the duration and severity of the economic impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the credit quality of certain property types 
within our CRE loan portfolio, such as retail, hotel/motel, office 
buildings, and shopping centers, could continue to be adversely 
affected. 

The total CRE loan portfolio increased $1.8 billion in 2020 
driven by an increase in CRE construction loans predominantly 
related to the apartments property type. The CRE loan portfolio 
included $8.9 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at December 31, 
2020. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by 
property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE 
loans are in California, New York, Florida and Texas, which 
combined represented 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The 
largest property type concentrations are office buildings at 26% 
and apartments at 19% of the portfolio. Table 17 summarizes 
CRE loans by state and property type with the related nonaccrual 
totals at December 31, 2020.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At December 31, 2020, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$72.9 billion, representing approximately 8% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $80.5 billion, or 
approximately 8% of total consolidated loans outstanding, at 
December 31, 2019. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of 
our consolidated total assets at both December 31, 2020 and 
2019. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, which 
gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Table 18:  Select Country Exposures 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S., based 
on our assessment of risk at December 31, 2020, was the United 
Kingdom, which totaled $42.1 billion, or approximately 2% of our 
total assets, and included $15.4 billion of sovereign claims. Our 
United Kingdom sovereign claims arise predominantly from 
deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to 
regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. 

Table 18 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 18: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $45.2 billion exposure to financial institutions and $43.8 billion to non-financial corporations at December 31, 2020. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 92% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 
2020, compared with 91% at December 31, 2019. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both December 31, 2020 and 
2019. We believe our origination process appropriately addresses 
our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across our 
residential mortgage loan portfolios and our ACL for loans 
considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do 

we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment 
amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services 
industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. In connection 
with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, our residential 
mortgage purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, which had a 
carrying value of $568 million, were reclassified as purchased 
credit deteriorated (PCD) loans. PCD loans are generally 
accounted for in the same manner as non-PCD loans. For 
additional information on PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 

68 

Wells Fargo & Company  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difficulties. Loans are generally underwritten at the time of the 
modification in accordance with underwriting guidelines 
established for our loan modification programs. Under these 
programs, we may provide concessions such as interest rate 
reductions, forbearance of principal, and in some cases, principal 
forgiveness. These programs generally include trial payment 
periods of three to four months, and after successful completion 
and compliance with terms during this period, the loan is 
permanently modified. Loans included under these programs are 
accounted for as TDRs at the start of the trial period or at the 
time of permanent modification, if no trial period is used. See the 
“Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” 
section in this Report for discussion on how we determine the 
ACL attributable to our modified residential mortgage loan 
portfolios. For additional information on customer 
accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in this Report. 

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolios as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our underwriting and periodic review of 
loans and lines secured by residential real estate collateral 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based 
tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a 
lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of 
large numbers of properties in a short period of time using 
market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The 
primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of 
an individual property may vary significantly from the average for

the market area. We have processes to periodically validate 
AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the 
circumstances when AVMs may be used. AVMs are not allowed in 
residential mortgage origination underwriting. Broker 
evaluations and enhanced desktop appraisal reports are allowed 
in junior lien originations and some first lien line of credit 
originations up to $250,000. An appraisal is required for all 
residential mortgage commitments greater than $250,000. 
Additional information about appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for 
their use can be found in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
Excluding government insured/guaranteed loans, these credit 
risk indicators on the residential mortgage portfolio were: 
• 

Loans 30 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2020, 
totaled $4.7 billion, or 2% of total mortgages, compared 
with $3.0 billion, or 1%, at December 31, 2019. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition 
of delinquencies; 
Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 totaled $5.6 billion, 
or 2% of total mortgages at December 31, 2020, compared 
with $7.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2019; and 
•  Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 

• 

$1.6 billion at December 31, 2020, or 1% of total mortgages, 
compared with $2.5 billion, or 1%, at December 31, 2019.

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our total residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $17.2 billion in 2020, 
driven by loan paydowns as a result of the low interest rate 
environment, partially offset by mortgage loan originations of 
$57.6 billion and our repurchase of $30.0 billion of loans from 
GNMA loan securitization pools.

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and are therefore included with other non-PCD loans in this table. For additional information, see

Residential Mortgage – Junior Lien Portfolio  The residential 
mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of residential mortgage 
lines and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on 
the same property. It is not unusual for these lines and loans to 
have draw periods, interest-only payments, balloon payments, 
adjustable rates and similar features. Junior lien loan products are 
primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and 
repayment periods between five to 30 years. We continuously 
monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – 
junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the 

frequency and severity of losses, such as residential mortgage – 
junior lien performance when the residential mortgage – first lien 
loan is delinquent. 

The decrease in the residential mortgage – junior lien 
portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 
2019, predominantly reflected loan paydowns. Beginning in 
second quarter 2020, we suspended the origination of residential 
mortgage – junior lien loans. Table 21 shows certain delinquency 
and loss information for the residential mortgage – junior lien 
portfolio and lists the top five states by outstanding balance.

In connection with our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and are therefore included with other non-PCD loans in this table. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first 

and junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for 
credit line products) to property collateral value. For additional 
information on consumer loans by LTV/CLTV, see Table 4.12 in 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

As of December 31, 2020, with respect to loans in the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio that had a CLTV ratio 
in excess of 100%: 
• 

such loans totaled 3% of the outstanding balance of the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio; 
3% were 30 days or more past due. Customer payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies; and 
the unsecured portion (the outstanding amount that was in 
excess of the most recent property collateral value) of the 
outstanding balances of these loans totaled 1% of the 
residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio.

Residential Mortgage – Junior Lien Line and Loan and 
Residential Mortgage – First Lien Line  Our junior lien, as well as 
first lien, lines of credit portfolios generally have draw periods of 
10, 15 or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment 
options available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or 
(2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. 
As of December 31, 2020, lines of credit in a draw period 
primarily used the interest-only option. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 

increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased risk in our ACL for loans estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 
contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only 
to fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 22 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
residential mortgage – junior liens, including lines and loans, and 
residential mortgage – first lien lines segregated into scheduled 
end of draw or end-of-term periods and products that are 
currently amortizing, or in balloon repayment status. The 
unfunded credit commitments for residential mortgage – junior 
and first lien lines totaled $53.6 billion at December 31, 2020.

Substantially all lines and loans are scheduled to convert to amortizing loans by the end of 2030, with annual scheduled amounts through 2030 ranging from $1.1 billion to $3.8 billion and averaging 
$2.0 billion per year. 
Includes $63 million of end-of-term balloon payments which were past due. 

At December 31, 2020, $381 million, or 2%, of lines in their 

draw period were 30 days or more past due, compared with 
$378 million, or 5%, of amortizing lines of credit. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies. On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment 
characteristics of borrowers in our residential mortgage – first 
and junior lien lines of credit portfolios. In December 2020, 
excluding borrowers with COVID-related loan modification 
payment deferrals: 
• 

Approximately 43% of these borrowers paid only the 
minimum amount due and approximately 51% paid more 
than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 
delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. 
For the borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, 
approximately 28% paid only the minimum amount due and 
approximately 66% paid more than the minimum amount 
due.

CREDIT CARDS  The decrease in the outstanding balance at 
December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, was 
driven by changes in consumer spending due to the economic 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

AUTO  The outstanding balance at December 31, 2020, compared 
with December 31, 2019, was flat as originations of $22.8 billion 
in 2020 were offset by paydowns. 

OTHER CONSUMER  The decrease in the outstanding balance at 
December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, was 
driven by $9.8 billion of student loans transferred to loans held 
for sale after the announced sale of our student loan portfolio in 
fourth quarter 2020.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
• 

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes 
uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; 
they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential 
mortgages) past due for interest or principal, unless the loan 
is both well-secured and in the process of collection or the 
loan is in an active payment deferral as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic; 
part of the principal balance has been charged off; or 
for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related 
first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 
process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status. 

• 

• 
• 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of nonaccrual loans for those customers who would 
have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For additional 
information on customer accommodations, including loan 
modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related 
Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 

Consumer credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual 
status, but are generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 
180 days past due.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018, has been revised to exclude LHFS and loans held at fair value of $390 million and $463 million at December 31, 2017, and 2016, 
respectively. 
Prior to January 1, 2020, PCI loans were excluded from nonaccrual loans because they continued to earn interest income from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance with their 
contractual terms. However, as a result of our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, $275 million of residential mortgage loans were reclassified from PCI to PCD loans, and as a result, were also 
classified as nonaccrual loans given their contractual delinquency. For additional information on PCD loans, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For more information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The increase in commercial nonaccrual loans at 

The increase in consumer nonaccrual loans at December 31, 

December 31, 2020, compared with December 31, 2019, was 
driven by: 
• 

an increase in commercial and industrial loans in the oil and 
gas, transportation services, and entertainment and 
recreation portfolios; and 
an increase in commercial real estate mortgage loans in 
hotel/motel, shopping center, and office buildings property 
types reflecting the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

• 

72 

2020, compared with December 31, 2019, was driven by: 
• 

an increase in residential mortgage loans driven by COVID-
related payment deferral programs that were classified as 
nonaccrual because they did not qualify for legislative or 
regulatory relief; and 
the implementation of CECL, which required PCI loans to be 
classified as nonaccruing based on performance.

Table 26 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

We believe exposure to loss on nonaccrual loans is mitigated 

• 

by the following factors at December 31, 2020: 
• 

95% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and 99% of total 
consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the consumer 
nonaccrual loans, 94% are secured by real estate and 91% 
have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $732 million and $1.0 billion have already been 
recognized on 19% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 31% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively, in accordance 
with our charge-off policies. Once we write down loans to 
the net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated 
costs to sell), we re-evaluate each loan regularly and record 
additional write-downs if needed. 
77% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 70% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain. 
of the $1.2 billion of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$747 million were current. 

• 

• 

• 

the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered in developing our allowance for loan losses. 

If interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that 

were, but are no longer on nonaccrual status at year end) had 
been accrued under the original terms, approximately 
$329 million of interest would have been recorded as income on 
these loans, compared with $303 million actually recorded as 
interest income in 2020, versus $361 million and $316 million, 
respectively, in 2019. 

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 
financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification. Under our proprietary modification programs, 
customers may be required to provide updated documentation, 
and some programs require completion of payment during trial 
periods to demonstrate sustained performance before the loan 
can be removed from nonaccrual status.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed autos. 

Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2020, included 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 

$73 million of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 24% is 
predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining amount of 
foreclosed assets has been written down to estimated net 
realizable value. Of the $159 million in foreclosed assets at 
December 31, 2020, 55% have been in the foreclosed assets 
portfolio for one year or less. 

COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended certain 
mortgage foreclosure activities, which has affected the amount 
of our foreclosed assets. For additional information on loans in 
process of foreclosure, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance

TDRs at December 31, 2020, increased, compared with 
December 31, 2019, due to higher loan modifications as a result 
of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire 
amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we 
delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal 
(principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance 
if that amount is not considered fully collectible. The allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs was $565 million and $1.0 billion at 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As part of our 
actions to support customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
we have provided borrowers relief in the form of loan 
modifications. Under the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, loan modifications related to the COVID-19 
pandemic will not be classified as TDRs if they meet certain 
eligibility criteria. For additional information on the CARES Act 
and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality Overview – Troubled 
Debt Restructuring Relief” section in this Report. 

Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan 

types when a restructuring is involved. We typically 
re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment 
capacity based on the borrower’s documented income, debt to 
income ratios, and other factors. Loans lacking sufficient 
evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time of 

Table 30:  Analysis of Changes in TDRs 

modification are charged down to the fair value of the collateral, 
if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been modified, if the 
borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous 
terms and the underwriting process shows the capacity to 
continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will 
generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be 
placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to accruing 
status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of 
performance, generally six consecutive months of payments, or 
equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to 
modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and 
a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when 
we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the 
modified agreement will not be collectible. See Note 4 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report for additional information regarding TDRs. 

Table 30 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Loans 
90 days or more past due are still accruing if they are (1) well-
secured and in the process of collection or (2) residential 
mortgage loans or consumer loans exempt under regulatory 
rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, 
usually 120 days past due. Prior to January 1, 2020, PCI loans 
were excluded from loans 90 days or more past due and still 

accruing loans because they continued to earn interest income 
from accretable yield, independent of performance in accordance 
with their contractual terms. In connection with our adoption of 
CECL, PCI loans were reclassified as PCD loans and classified as 
accruing or nonaccruing based on performance. 

Table 31 reflects loans 90 days or more past due and still 
accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed.

Financial information for periods prior to December 31, 2018, has been revised to exclude LHFS and loans held at fair value, which reduced “Total, not government insured/guaranteed” by $6 million, 
$5 million and $4 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
PCI loans totaling $102 million, $3.7 billion, $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are excluded from this table. PCI loans were reclassified as PCD 
loans and classified as accruing or nonaccruing based on performance beginning January 1, 2020. 
Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 
Represents loans whose repayments are primarily guaranteed by agencies on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). All remaining 
student loans guaranteed under the FFELP were sold as of March 31, 2017. 

Excluding government insured/guaranteed loans, loans 
90 days or more past due and still accruing at December 31, 
2020, were down from December 31, 2019, due to lower 
delinquencies in consumer loans as payment deferral activities 
instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic delayed 
recognition of delinquencies for customers who would have 
otherwise moved into past due status. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 
repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA for mortgages at December 31, 2020, were flat 
compared with December 31, 2019, as our repurchases of 
accruing loans more than 90 days past due from GNMA loan 
securitization pools were offset by paydowns and transfers to 
LHFS. For additional information on delinquencies by loan class, 
see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report.

(1)  Quarterly net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs in 2020 was 

driven by: 
• 

higher commercial and industrial losses primarily in our oil, 
gas and pipelines portfolio; and 
higher commercial real estate mortgage losses. 

• 

The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in 2020 was 

driven by: 
• 

lower losses in credit card and other consumer loans as a 
result of payment deferral activities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of net loan 
charge-offs. For additional information on customer 
accommodations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see 
the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-
Related Lending Accommodations” section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded 
credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans 

78 

and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held 
for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities 
classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets measured 
at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-
balance sheet credit exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. For additional information on our ACL for loans, see 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our ACL for debt securities, see the “Balance 
Sheet Analysis – Available-For-Sale and Held-To-Maturity Debt 
Securities” section and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Disclosure is not comparative due to our adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 33 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans increased $9.3 billion, or 89%, from 
December 31, 2019, driven by a $10.6 billion increase in the ACL 
for loans in 2020, reflecting current and forecasted economic 
conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on 
borrower performance, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease 
as a result of adopting CECL. Total provision for credit losses for 
loans was $14.0 billion in 2020, compared with $2.7 billion in 
2019. The increase in the provision for credit losses for loans in 
2020, compared with 2019, reflected an increase in the ACL for 
loans due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio 
segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is 
included in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 

estimate of the ACL for loans. The scenarios generally include a 
base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Our estimate of the ACL for 
loans at December 31, 2020, was based on a weighting of the 
base and a downside economic scenario of 50% and 50%, 

respectively, with no weighting applied to an upside scenario. The 
base scenario assumed near-term economic stress recovering 
into late 2021. The downside scenario assumed more sustained 
adverse economic impacts resulting from the COVID-19 
pandemic, compared with the base scenario. The downside 
scenario assumed U.S. real GDP increasing but not fully 
recovering during 2021, and a sustained elevation in the U.S. 
unemployment rate until mid-2022. We considered within each 
scenario our expectations for the impact of customer 
accommodation activity, as well as the estimated impact on 
certain industries that we consider to be directly and most 
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In addition to quantitative estimates, we consider qualitative 

factors that represent risks inherent in our processes and 
assumptions such as economic environmental factors, modeling 
assumptions and performance, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. During 
2020, we considered the significant uncertainty related to the 
duration and severity of the economic impacts from the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the incremental risks to our loan 
portfolio. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at September 30 and December 31, 2020, 
are presented in Table 34.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
GDP), among other factors. Based on economic conditions at the 
end of fourth quarter 2020, it was difficult to estimate the length 
and severity of the economic downturn that may result from the 
COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of other factors that may 
influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding 
requirements for future amounts of the ACL, including the 
impact of economic stimulus programs and customer 
accommodation activity. The COVID-19 pandemic could 
continue to impact the recognition of credit losses in our loan 
portfolios and may result in increases in our ACL, particularly if 
the impact on the economy worsens. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $19.7 billion at 

December 31, 2020, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total 
loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects 
existing factors as of the date of determination, including 
economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for 
loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is 
possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for 
determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the 
“Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” 
section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES  We sell 
residential mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private 
label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In 
addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage 
loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed by the 

80 

Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We may 
be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of 
the breach. 

In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 

mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a 
mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to 
various representations and warranties that reflect 
management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service 
those loans, based on a combination of factors. Our mortgage 
repurchase liability estimation process also incorporates a 
forecast of repurchase demands associated with mortgage 
insurance rescission activity. 

Customary with industry practice, we have the right of 

recourse against correspondent lenders from whom we have 
purchased loans with respect to representations and warranties. 
Historical recovery rates as well as projected lender performance 
are incorporated in the establishment of our mortgage 
repurchase liability. 

We do not typically receive repurchase requests from 

GNMA, FHA and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) or VA. As an originator of an FHA-insured or 
VA-guaranteed loan, we are responsible for obtaining the 
insurance with the FHA or the guarantee with the VA. To the 
extent we are not able to obtain the insurance or the guarantee 
we must request permission to repurchase the loan from the 
GNMA pool. Such repurchases from GNMA pools typically 
represent a self-initiated process upon discovery of the 
uninsurable loan (usually within 180 days from funding of the 
loan). Alternatively, in lieu of repurchasing loans from GNMA 
pools, we may be asked by FHA/HUD or the VA to indemnify 
them (as applicable) for defects found in the Post Endorsement 
Technical Review process or audits performed by FHA/HUD or 
the VA. The Post Endorsement Technical Review is a process 
whereby HUD performs underwriting audits of closed/insured 
FHA loans for potential deficiencies. Our liability for mortgage 
loan repurchase losses incorporates probable losses associated 
with such indemnification. 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to servicing 
loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or master servicer of 
residential mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and 
private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for 
unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 

The loans we service were originated by us or by other 
mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance 
certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the 
mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or 
primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage 
loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of 
taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, (5) 
foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent 
consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider 
alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short 
sales, and (6) for loans sold into private label securitizations, 
manage the foreclosed property through liquidation.

The amount and timing of reimbursement of advances of 

delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. Due to continued customer requests for 
payment deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
amount of our servicing advances of principal and interest 
remained elevated. The amount of these advances may continue 
to increase if additional payment deferrals are provided. Payment 
deferrals also delay the collection of contractually specified 
servicing fees, resulting in lower net servicing income. 
In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, 

delinquency status continues to advance for loans with COVID-
related payment deferrals, which has resulted in an increase in 
delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase 
in loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to 
repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which 
becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments 
remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these 
loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not 
change. Since April 1, 2020, we repurchased $28.6 billion of these 
delinquent loans, substantially all of which had COVID-related 
payment deferrals. 

Loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in 

accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included 
in future GNMA loan securitization pools. However, in accordance 
with guidance issued by GNMA, loans repurchased after June 30, 
2020, with COVID-related payment deferrals are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. At December 31, 2020, the amount of 
repurchased GNMA loans with COVID-related payment deferrals 
that were ineligible for inclusion in future GNMA loan 
securitization pools due to this requirement was $22.6 billion. 
As master servicer, our primary duties are typically to (1) 
supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of the mortgage 
loans by the servicer, (2) consult with each servicer and use 
reasonable efforts to cause the servicer to observe its servicing 
obligations, (3) prepare monthly distribution statements to 
security holders and, if required by the securitization documents, 
certain periodic reports required to be filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC), (4) if required by the 
securitization documents, calculate distributions and loss 
allocations on the mortgage-backed securities, (5) prepare tax 
and information returns of the securitization trust, and (6) 
advance amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to 
perform their advancing obligations. 

Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master 

servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity and provides protection against 
expenses and liabilities we incur when acting in compliance with 
the specified standard. For example, private label securitization 
agreements under which we act as servicer or master servicer 
typically provide that the servicer and the master servicer are 
entitled to indemnification by the securitization trust for taking 
action or refraining from taking action in good faith or for errors 
in judgment. However, we are not indemnified, but rather are 
required to indemnify the securitization trustee, against any 
failure by us, as servicer or master servicer, to perform our 
servicing obligations or against any of our acts or omissions that 
involve willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the 
performance of, or reckless disregard of, our duties. In addition, if 
we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or 
master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is 
not cured within a specified period following notice, which can 

generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified 
percentage of security holders. Whole loan sale contracts under 
which we act as servicer generally include similar provisions with 
respect to our actions as servicer. The standards governing 
servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible 
remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those 
standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides 
maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and 
individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs 
from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification 
or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in 
connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject 
to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and 
state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In 
general, these can require us to provide customers with loan 
modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention 
and assistance, and can result in the imposition of certain 
monetary penalties on us. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. At the management level, the 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee (Corporate ALCO), which 
consists of management from finance, risk and business groups, 
oversees these risks and supports periodic reports provided to 
the Board’s Finance Committee and Risk Committee as 
appropriate. As discussed in more detail for market risk activities 
below, we employ separate management level oversight specific 
to market risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 
Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a 
slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

•

• 

Currently, our profile is such that we project net interest 
income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would 
reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in 
the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice 

81 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in 
lower net interest income. 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment speeds on 
loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 35, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and 
short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three 
years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 
0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for 
the scenarios presented in Table 35: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

• 

reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, 
our trading assets are (before the effects of certain economic 
hedges) generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than 
the related funding liabilities. As a result, net interest income 
from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest 
rates rise and fall, respectively. The impact to net interest income 
does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, 
which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are 
recorded in noninterest income. For more information on our 
trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on the use of the debt securities 
portfolios. The notional or contractual amount, credit risk 
amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our 
interest rate risk exposures as of December 31, 2020, and 
December 31, 2019, are presented in Note 16 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. We use derivatives for asset/ 
liability management in two main ways: 
• 

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across 
the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer activity that shifts balances into higher-yielding 
products could reduce expected net interest income. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by 
mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. Mortgage originations 
generally decline in response to higher interest rates and 
generally increase in response to lower interest rates, particularly 
refinancing activity. Mortgage banking results are also impacted 
by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the 
“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for 
additional information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from 
changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that 

82 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. 
Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit 
and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We 
determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or 
held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our 
intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our 
corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also 
retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we 
securitize mortgage loans. 

We typically originate agency residential mortgage loans as 
held for sale and certain prime non-agency residential mortgage 
loans as held for investment. Occasionally, we designate some of 
our non-agency residential mortgage loan originations as held for 
sale in support of future issuances of private label residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We issued $2.6 billion and 
$2.4 billion of RMBS in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in our 

mortgage businesses. Changes in interest rates may impact 
origination and servicing fees, the fair value of our residential 
MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate 
“locks”) extended to mortgage applicants, as well as the 
associated income or loss in mortgage banking noninterest 
income, including the gains or losses related to economic hedges 
of MSRs and LHFS. Given the time it takes for customer behavior 
to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required 
for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and 
securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will 
generally affect our mortgage banking noninterest income on a 
lagging basis. The amount and timing of the impact will depend 
on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest 
rates. 

The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly 
subjective and involve complex judgments by management 

Wells Fargo & Company 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See the “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage 
Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional 
information. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of 
significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of 
residential MSRs, including prepayment speeds, expected returns 
and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to 
service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing 
valuation elements. For additional information on mortgage 
banking, including key economic assumptions and the sensitivity 
of the fair value of MSRs, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking 
Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

An increase in interest rates generally reduces the 

propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the 
servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair 
value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also 
reduce mortgage loan demand, which reduces noninterest 
income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates 
would generally have an opposite impact. 

To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our 
residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of 
derivative instruments, including highly liquid mortgage forward 
contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate options. MSR 
hedging results include a combination of directional gain or loss 
due to market changes as well as any carry income related to 
mortgage forward contracts. Carry income represents accretion 
from the forward delivery price to the spot price including both 
the yield earned on the reference securities and the market 
implied cost of financing during the period. A steep yield curve 
generally produces higher carry income while a flat or inverted 
yield curve can result in lower or potentially negative carry 
income. 

The size of the hedge and the particular combination of 
forward hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to 
reduce the volatility of our earnings over various time frames 
within a range of mortgage interest rates. Because market 
factors, the composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio and 
the relationship between the origination and servicing sides of 
our mortgage businesses change continually, the types of 
instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and 
rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and 
the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment on private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s 
market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In 
addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting 
the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance 
Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk 
matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight 
responsibility for market risk. The Market and Counterparty Risk 
Management function reports into the CRO and provides 
periodic reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance 
Committee. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
more information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are 
monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated 
levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management 
function aggregates and monitors all exposures to ensure risk 
measures are within our established risk appetite. Changes to the 
market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The 
Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from 
a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk 
type, and legal entity. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 36 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation 
model which assumes that historical changes in market values 
are representative of the potential future outcomes and 
measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 
1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical 
simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 
12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 
12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is 
responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence 
level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur 

83

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on 
average once every 100 trading days. 

Average Company Trading General VaR was $123 million for 

the year ended December 31, 2020, compared with $22 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in average 

Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December 31, 
2020, was driven by market volatility due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, in particular changes in interest rate curves and a 
significant widening of credit spreads entering the 12-month 
historical look-back window used to calculate VaR.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR 
models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity 
analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the 
measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% 
increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We 
conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, 
volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. 
Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication 
of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market 
moves. 

Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to adverse 
changes in markets using recent historical market data, stress 
testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to 
extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios 
estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions 
of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit 
spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These 
scenarios assume that the market moves happen 
instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes 
place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative 
approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). 

An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both 

historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad 
range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation 
and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the 
impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio 
values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase 
across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. 
Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress 
scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis 
addresses how these events might affect the risk factors 
relevant to a portfolio. 

The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in 
calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal 
stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated 
to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail 
on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in 
this Report.

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. These private equity 
investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to 
assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For 
nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts 
and circumstances of each individual investment and the 
expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the 
viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable 
price changes that are similar to the investments held. 
Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private 
equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair 
value through net income, and the measurement alternative. 
In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was 
apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To 
manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 
through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of 
September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to 
compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a 
litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated 
with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained 
litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our 
consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about the 
associated litigation matters, see the “Interchange Litigation” 
section in Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 

Wells Fargo & Company 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by 
management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO 
and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these 
marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For 
additional information, see Note 6 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and market 
stress. For more information on these obligations, see the 
following sections and Notes to Financial Statements in this 
Report:

Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 4) 
Leasing Activity (Note 5)

• 
•  Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 13) 
• 
•

To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity 

guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover 
potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence 
on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are 
monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a 
quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established and 
monitored for both the consolidated company and for the Parent 
on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Parent is a source of 
strength for its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. 
The Parent acts as a source of funding for the Company through 
the issuance of long-term debt and equity, and WFC Holdings, 
LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the 
Parent (the “IHC”), provides funding support for the ongoing 
operational requirements of the Parent and certain of its direct 
and indirect subsidiaries. For more information on the IHC, see 
the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related 
Matters” section in this Report. 

Liquidity Stress Tests  Liquidity stress tests are performed to 
help ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet 
contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of 
stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as 
corporate-specific events, including a range of stress conditions 
and time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of 
the Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and 
inform future needs in the Company’s funding plan. 

Contingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP), 
which is approved by Corporate ALCO and the Board’s Risk 
Committee, sets out the Company’s strategies and action plans 

to address potential liquidity needs during market-wide or 
idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP establishes measures for 
monitoring emerging liquidity events and describes the 
processes for communicating and managing stress events should 
they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate funding and liquidity 
strategies available to the Company in a period of stress. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule, issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC, that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization, such as 
Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), 
predominantly consisting of central bank deposits, government 
debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal 
agencies that can be converted easily and quickly into cash, in an 
amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows 
during a 30-day stress period. The LCR applies to the Company 
on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions 
(IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules 
issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large BHCs, such as Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term subordinated debt and 
most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative 
exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. The 
NSFR will become effective on July 1, 2021, and applies to the 
Company on a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total assets 
of $10 billion or more. Based on our liquidity profile at 
December 31, 2020, we expect to be compliant with the NSFR 
requirement. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of December 31, 2020, the 
consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo 
National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 
100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash 
outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 37 presents 
the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated 
LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule 
requirements.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 38, which also includes encumbered securities that are not 
included as available HQLA in the calculation of the LCR. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 

debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 38, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. As of December 31, 2020, we also maintained 
approximately $244.1 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 158% and 137% of total 
loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional 
funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings. Table 39 shows selected information for short-term 
borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. We 
pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of 
Note 14 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements

decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies 
with regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2020. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional 
information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact 
a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and 
operations, as well as Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for information regarding additional 
collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative 
instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below 
investment grade.

Long-Term Debt  We access domestic and international capital 
markets for long-term funding (generally greater than one year) 
through issuances of registered debt securities, private 
placements and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-
term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve 
cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity 
profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general 
corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may 
purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in 
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender 
offer, or otherwise. We issued $38.1 billion of long-term debt in 
2020. For additional information, see Note 12 (Long-Term Debt) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. FHLB members are 
required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, the amount of any future investment in the capital 
stock of the FHLBs is not determinable.

Wells Fargo & Company  
 
 
 
 
Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
December 31, 2020, decreased $3.8 billion from December 31, 
2019, predominantly as a result of common and preferred stock 
dividends of $6.3 billion, partially offset by $3.3 billion of 
Wells Fargo net income. During 2020, we issued $2.7 billion of 
common stock, substantially all of which was issued in 
connection with employee stock ownership plans, excluding 
conversions of preferred shares. During 2020, we repurchased 
75.7 million shares of common stock at a cost of $3.4 billion, 
substantially all of which occurred in first quarter 2020. For 
additional information about capital planning, including the FRB’s 
recent restrictions on capital distributions, see the “Capital 
Planning and Stress Testing” section below. 

In 2020, we issued $3.2 billion of preferred stock and 
redeemed $3.3 billion of preferred stock. In January 2021, we 
issued $3.5 billion of our Preferred Stock, Series BB, and in 
February 2021, we issued $1.05 billion of our Preferred Stock, 
Series CC. Additionally, in February 2021, we announced the 
redemption of our Preferred Stock, Series I, Series P and 
Series W, and a partial redemption of our Preferred Stock, 
Series N, for an aggregate cost of $4.5 billion. For additional 
information, see Note 18 (Preferred Stock) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo. 
Our capital adequacy is assessed based on the lower of our risk-
based capital ratios calculated under the two approaches. The 
Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments. Table 41 and Table 42 present the 
risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company on a 
fully phased-in basis under the Standardized Approach and 
Advanced Approach, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.

G-SIB capital surcharge 

Capital conservation buffer 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 41 and Table 42, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 

institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced 
Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of 
economic or financial stress. 

The stress capital buffer, which replaced the capital 

conservation buffer under the Standardized Approach beginning 
October 1, 2020, is calculated based on the decrease in a BHC’s 
risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in 
the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future years. In August 2020, the FRB 
announced that the Company’s stress capital buffer for the 
period October 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021, is 2.50%. 
However, in December 2020, in conjunction with a capital plan 
resubmission process, the FRB announced that it was extending 
through March 31, 2021, the time period during which it can 
recalculate the stress capital buffers of large BHCs. 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
  
  
 
 
 
As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are 

also subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional 
capital surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must 
annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use 
the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method 
one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-
jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, 
consistent with the methodology developed by the BCBS and 
the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method 
(method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability 
with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally 
result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because 
the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on 
data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is 
subject to change in future years. 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 
tier 1 capital, along with risk-weighted assets (RWAs), are fully 
phased-in. However, the requirements for determining tier 2 and 
total capital are still in accordance with Transition Requirements 
and are scheduled to be fully phased-in by the end of 2021. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 

Table 43:  Capital Components and Ratios (Fully Phased-In) 

nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total RWAs. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Although we report certain capital amounts and 
ratios in accordance with Transition Requirements for bank 
regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our capital on a fully 
phased-in basis. For information about our capital requirements 
calculated in accordance with Transition Requirements, see 
Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other 
Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 43 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, 

RWAs and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at 
December 31, 2020 and 2019. Fully phased-in total capital 
amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures 
that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, 
investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s 
capital position. See Table 44 for information regarding the 
calculation and components of our CET1, tier 1 capital, total 
capital and RWAs, as well as a corresponding reconciliation to 
GAAP financial measures for our fully phased-in total capital 
amounts.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
At December 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking regulators on our regulatory capital was an increase in capital of $1.7 billion, reflecting a $991 million 
(post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $10.8 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020. 
Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital, to the extent the excess allowance does not exceed 0.60% of 
Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in tier 2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs, in each case with any excess 
allowance for credit losses being deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. 
Includes an increase of $1.4 billion under the Standardized Approach and a decrease of $1.4 billion under the Advanced Approach related to the impact of the CECL transition provision on our excess 
allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020. See footnote (3) to this table. 
Amounts for December 31, 2019, have been revised as a result of a decrease in RWAs under the Advanced Approach due to the correction of duplicated operational loss amounts.

At December 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking regulators on our regulatory capital was an increase in capital of $1.7 billion, reflecting a $991 million 
(post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $10.8 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) 
tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; 
and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), 

which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of 
tangible common equity. The methodology of determining 
tangible common equity may differ among companies. 
Management believes that tangible book value per common 
share and return on average tangible common equity, which 
utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures 
because they enable management, investors, and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 47 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 48 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
December 31, 2020.

The FRB and OCC have proposed rules (Proposed SLR rules) 

that would replace the 2.00% supplementary leverage buffer 
with a buffer equal to one-half of our G-SIB capital surcharge. 
The Proposed SLR rules would similarly tailor the current 6.00% 
SLR requirement for our IDIs. 

In April 2020, the FRB issued an interim final rule that 
temporarily allows a BHC to exclude on-balance sheet amounts 
of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks 
from the calculation of its total leverage exposure in the 
denominator of the SLR. This interim final rule became effective 
on April 1, 2020, and expires on March 31, 2021.

The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. Our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-
term debt requirements as of December 31, 2020, are presented 
in Table 50.

Under the Proposed SLR rules, the 2.00% external TLAC 
leverage buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to one-half 
of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge, and the leverage 
component for calculating the minimum amount of eligible 
unsecured long-term debt would be modified from 4.50% of 
total leverage exposure to 2.50% of total leverage exposure plus 
one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge. 

As of December 31, 2020, our eligible external TLAC as a 
percentage of total RWAs was 25.74%, compared with a required 
minimum of 22.00%. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company’s 
G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method one, which is a 
component of our TLAC buffer requirement, decreased from 
1.50% to 1.00%. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2021, our TLAC 
requirement as a percentage of total RWAs decreased from 
22.00% to 21.50%. Similar to the risk-based capital 
requirements, our minimum TLAC requirement is assessed based 
on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and 
Advanced Approaches. 

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  As 
discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report, federal banking regulators have issued 
final rules regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR 
and NSFR. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess 
of 10.00%. Our capital targets are subject to change based on 
various factors, including changes to the regulatory capital 
framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by 
bank regulatory agencies, changes to the regulatory 
requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, 
changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

We submitted our 2020 capital plan to the FRB on April 3, 

2020. As part of the 2020 CCAR, the FRB also generated a 
supervisory stress test. The FRB reviewed the supervisory stress 
test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a 
common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and also 
reviewed the Company’s proposed capital actions. The FRB 
published its supervisory stress test results on June 25, 2020. 
On June 25, 2020, the FRB also announced that it was 
requiring large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, to update and 
resubmit their capital plans. We updated and resubmitted our 
capital plan on November 2, 2020, and the FRB published its 
resubmission supervisory stress test results on 
December 18, 2020. 

On December 18, 2020, the FRB announced that it was 
extending, with certain adjustments, measures it announced on 
June 25, 2020, limiting large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, from 
making any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution 
arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for 
inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless 
otherwise approved by the FRB. For first quarter 2021, the FRB 
has generally authorized BHCs to (i) provided that the BHC does 
not increase the amount of its common stock dividends to be 
larger than the level paid in second quarter 2020, pay common 
stock dividends and make share repurchases that, in the 

93

Capital Management (continued) 

aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the 
BHC’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters; (ii) 
make share repurchases that equal the amount of share 
issuances related to expensed employee compensation; and (iii) 
redeem and make scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and 
tier 2 capital instruments. The FRB is expected to announce by 
March 31, 2021, whether these capital distribution limitations 
will be extended for another quarter. 

Concurrently with CCAR, federal banking regulators also 

require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests 
to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to 
continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and 
financial conditions. We submitted the results of our stress test 
to the FRB and disclosed a summary of the results in June 2020. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights 
the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight 
initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For 
additional information about the regulatory matters discussed 
below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, 
see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2020 Form 
10-K, and the “Capital Management,” “Forward-Looking 
Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 28 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform 
legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional 
information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its 
rulemaking initiatives. 
• 

Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important 
firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal 
banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and 
regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. 
The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing 
enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based 
capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single 
counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity 
limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave 
threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB 
and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress 
testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In 
addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish 
remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress and has proposed additional requirements 
regarding effective risk management practices at large 
BHCs, including its expectations for boards of directors and 

94 

expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 
amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

As discussed in the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” 
section above, on December 18, 2020, the FRB announced that it 
was extending, with certain adjustments, measures prohibiting 
large BHCs subject to the FRB’s capital plan rule from making 
capital distributions subject to certain limited exceptions. 

At December 31, 2020, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 167 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. On January 15, 2021, we 
announced that the Board approved an increase in the 
Company's authority to repurchase common stock by an 
additional 500 million shares. For more information about share 
repurchases during fourth quarter 2020, see Part II, Item 5 in our 
2020 Form 10-K. 

senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has 
also finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance 
and risk management standards for large national banks 
such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require 
covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk 
governance framework to manage and control their risk-
taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and 
responsibilities for risk management practices within 
covered banks and create certain risk oversight 
responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to 
the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory 
requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-
Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may 
recommend new systemic risk management requirements 
and require new reporting of systemic risks. 
Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank 
Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate 
disclosures regarding financial products and are protected 
from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has 
issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial 
products, including rules regarding the origination, 
notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect 
to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting 
prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products. In 
addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is 
continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of 
the financial services industry with respect to a number of 
consumer businesses and products, including mortgage 
lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto 
finance. 
Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The 
Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for 
regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to 
authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC and the 
SEC have adopted comprehensive sets of rules regulating 
swaps and security-based swaps, respectively, and the OCC 

• 

• 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
and other federal regulatory agencies have adopted margin 
requirements for uncleared swaps and security-based swaps. 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as a provisionally-registered swap 
dealer, is subject to the CFTC’s swap rules and will become 
subject to the SEC’s security-based swap rules if it registers 
as a security-based swap dealer, which it is currently 
expected to do by November 1, 2021. These rules, as well as 
others adopted or under consideration by regulators in the 
United States and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact 
customer demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact 
our ability to offer customers new derivatives or 
amendments to existing derivatives, and may increase our 
costs for engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other 
derivatives activities. 

Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules 
issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-
based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The 
Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified 
leverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the 
Company is required to have a minimum amount of total loss 
absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. 
Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a 
liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For more 
information on the final risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity 
rules, and additional capital requirements applicable to us, see 
the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity 
Standards” sections in this Report. 

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as 
“living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. 
Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a 
reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable 
period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the 
risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the 
financial stability of the United States. In addition to the 
Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare 
and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements 
on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we 
adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any 
deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or 
operations. On June 27, 2019, we submitted our resolution plan 
to the FRB and FDIC. On December 17, 2019, the FRB and FDIC 
announced that the Company’s 2019 resolution plan did not have 
any deficiencies, but they identified a specific shortcoming that 
would need to be addressed. 

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 
important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 

default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), 
then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver 
and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s 
orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a 
company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are 
exposed to any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict 
priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
certain circumstances. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 

a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would likely 
be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, we are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry 
strategy, and the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an 
orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 
2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended 
and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with 
WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and 
subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo 
Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC 
(“WFCS”), and certain other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the 
Parent designated as material entities for resolution planning 
purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified as related support 
entities in our resolution plan (the “Related Support Entities”). 
Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a 
significant amount of its assets, including the majority of its cash, 
deposits, liquid securities and intercompany loans (but excluding 
its equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain other assets), to 
the IHC and will continue to transfer those types of assets to the 
IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial 
distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred 
assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, 
WFCS, and the Covered Entities pursuant to the Support 
Agreement. Under the Support Agreement, the IHC will also 
provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through subordinated 
notes and a committed line of credit, which, together with the 
issuance of dividends, is expected to provide the Parent, during 
business as usual operating conditions, with the same access to 
cash necessary to service its debts, pay dividends, repurchase its 
shares, and perform its other obligations as it would have had if it 
had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any 
assets. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below

defined triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it 
to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated 
notes would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would 
terminate, and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent 
would be restricted, any of which could materially and adversely 
impact the Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and 
other obligations, and could result in the commencement of 
bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than 
might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were 
not implemented. The respective obligations under the Support 
Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, the Bank, and the Related 
Support Entities are secured pursuant to a related security 
agreement. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of 
options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or 
systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses 
and restore market confidence without extraordinary 
government support. Recovery options include the possible sale, 
transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan portfolios or 
businesses. The Bank must also prepare and submit to the OCC a 
recovery plan that sets forth the Bank’s plan to remain a going 
concern when the Bank is experiencing considerable financial or 
operational stress, but has not yet deteriorated to the point 
where liquidation or resolution is imminent. If either the FRB or 
the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, they may 
impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately require us 
to divest assets. 

Other Regulatory Related Matters 
• 

Regulatory actions.  The Company is subject to a number of 
consent orders and regulatory agreements, which may 
require the Company, among other things, to undertake 
certain changes to its business, products and services, and 
risk management practices, and include the following: 
◦ 

FRB consent order regarding governance oversight and 
compliance and operational risk management.  On 
February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the FRB. As required by the consent order, 
the Board submitted to the FRB a plan to further 
enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the 
Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a 
plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and 
operational risk management program. The Company 
continues to engage with the FRB as the Company 
works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the 
FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the 
Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, 
to complete an initial third-party review of the 
enhancements and improvements provided for in the 
plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the 
plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as 
defined under the consent order will be limited to the 
level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this 
asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average 
basis to allow for management of temporary 
fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on April 8, 
2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance 
sheet exposure resulting from loans made by the 
Company in connection with the Small Business 
Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program and the 
FRB's Main Street Lending Program. As required under 

96 

◦ 

the amendment to the consent order, to the extent the 
Company chooses to exclude these exposures from the 
asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits 
received by the Company from loans made in 
connection with these programs shall be transferred to 
the U.S. Treasury or to non-profit organizations 
approved by the FRB that support small businesses. 
After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party 
review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy 
and sustainability of the enhancements and 
improvements. 
Consent orders with the CFPB and OCC regarding 
compliance risk management program, automobile 
collateral protection insurance policies, and mortgage 
interest rate lock extensions.  On April 20, 2018, the 
Company entered into consent orders with the CFPB 
and the OCC to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil 
money penalties to resolve matters regarding the 
Company’s compliance risk management program and 
past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain mortgage 
interest rate lock extensions. As required by the consent 
orders, the Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC 
an enterprise-wide compliance risk management plan 
and a plan to enhance the Company’s internal audit 
program with respect to federal consumer financial law 
and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as 
required by the consent orders, the Company submitted 
for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection 
insurance and mortgage interest rate lock matters, as 
well as a plan for the management of remediation 
activities conducted by the Company. 

• 

◦  OCC approval of director and senior executive officer 

appointments and certain post-termination payments. 
Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements 
that were originally imposed in November 2016 to 
provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-
objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in 
directors and senior executive officers, and remains 
subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-
termination payments to certain individuals and 
employees. 

Regulatory Developments Related to COVID-19.  In response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal 
banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help 
stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, 
and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like 
Wells Fargo to continue lending to consumers and 
businesses. For example, in order to facilitate the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES 
Act), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to 
encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus 
measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s 
Paycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a 
number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity 
and the functioning of markets, including facilities covering 
money market mutual funds and term asset-backed 
securities loans. Federal banking regulators also issued 
several rules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC rules 
and other prudential regulations to ease certain restrictions 
on banking organizations and encourage the use of certain 
FRB-established facilities in order to further promote 
lending to consumers and businesses. 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued guidelines for 

banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect 
to waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, and 
providing payment deferrals. Any current or future rules, 

regulations, and guidance related to the COVID-19 
pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain 
of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, 
impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect 
our business operations and/or competitive position. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Beginning in fourth quarter 2020, goodwill impairment was 

designated as one of our critical accounting policies. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an ACL for loans, which is management’s estimate 
of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded 
credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans 
and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held 
for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities 
classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured 
at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-
balance sheet credit exposures. In connection with our adoption 
of CECL, we updated our approach for estimating expected credit 
losses, which includes new areas for management judgment, 
described more fully below, and updated relevant accounting 
policies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a 
discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the 
judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the 
initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to 
time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business 
strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment 

strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in 
our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL 
to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security 
portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and 
consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of 
the Company. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast 
period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to 
estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables 
include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, 
and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic 
variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some 
economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, 
for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for 
unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real 
estate prices. Quarterly, we assess the length of the initial 
loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two 
years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast 
multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base 
scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises 
judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios 
that are used to estimate future credit losses. 
Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term 
average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the 
long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the 
forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages 
are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. 
The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is 
assessed on a quarterly basis. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually 
assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit 
variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower 
quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial 
strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default 
curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted 
collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted 
severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk 
ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers 
and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk 
specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. 
Management uses a combination of judgment and 
quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, 
modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the 
models. These models are validated in accordance with the 
Company’s policies by an internal model validation group. 
We routinely assess our model performance and apply 
adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss 
estimation. We also assess our models for limitations 
against the company-wide risk inventory to help ensure that 

97 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

• 

• 

we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our 
estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as 
needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial 
asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply 
judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases 
in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative 
allowance when the financial asset has been previously 
written-down below current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We 
extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension 
options. We also incorporate any scenarios where we 
reasonably expect to provide an extension through a TDR. 
Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which 
requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating 
the application of future payments to the outstanding loan 
amount. 

•  Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions 
used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity  The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by 
management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based 
on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio 
credit quality, and general economic conditions. General 
economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, 
which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or 
portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, 
there are observed changes in economic variables such as the 
unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not 
move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite 
directions or differ across portfolios or geography. 

Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s 

view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We 
applied 100% weight to the downside scenario in our sensitivity 
analysis to reflect the potential for further economic 
deterioration from a COVID-19 resurgence. The outcome of the 
scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of 
changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity 
analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of 
approximately $2.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The 
hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate 
the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors 
applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or 
negative effect on the results. It is possible that others 
performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different 
conclusions or results. 

The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities 

and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall 
ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for 
loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. 

98 

Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 
(MSRs) 
MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we purchase 
servicing rights from third parties, or retain servicing rights in 
connection with the sale or securitization of loans we originate 
(asset transfers). We also have acquired MSRs in the past under 
co-issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that 
were originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. 

We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans 
at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the 
economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are 
reflected in earnings. 

We use a model to estimate the fair value of our 
residential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with 
Company policies by an internal model validation group. The 
model calculates the present value of estimated future net 
servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions 
that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain 
significant inputs and assumptions generally are not 
observable in the market and require judgment to determine. 
If observable market indications do become available, these 
are factored into the estimates as appropriate: 
• 

The mortgage loan prepayment speed used to estimate future 
net servicing income.  The prepayment speed is the annual 
rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their 
mortgage loan principal; this rate also includes estimated 
borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment 
speeds and borrower defaults which are influenced by 
changes in mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. 
The discount rate used to present value estimated future net 
servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of 
return investors in the market would expect for an asset 
with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider 
the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates 
such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in 
future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on 
escrow accounts). 
The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net 
servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes 
estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency 
and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of 
defaulted loans as well as changes in servicing processes 
associated with default and foreclosure management. 

• 

• 

Both prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions can, 

and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and 
mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in 
either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption results 
in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in 
either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of 
the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-
driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and the discount 
rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the 
future. Additionally, while our current valuation reflects our best 
estimate of servicing costs, future regulatory or investor changes 
in servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state 
foreclosure legislation or additional market participant 
information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an 
impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation 
in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value 
estimate to independent appraisals. 

Wells Fargo & Company  
 
 
 
 
 
For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the 
financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value 
adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine 
fair value disclosures. For example, assets and liabilities held for 
trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS debt 
securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are carried at 
fair value each period. Other financial instruments, such as 
certain LHFS, a majority of nonmarketable equity securities, and 
loans held for investment, are not carried at fair value each 
period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments due 
to application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting, 
measurement alternative accounting or write-downs of 
individual assets. We also disclose our estimate of fair value for 
financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as loans 
held for investment or issuances of long-term debt. 

The accounting requirements for fair value measurements 

include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and 
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used for measurement are 
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-
derived or market-based information obtained from 
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our 
estimates about market data. 

When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the 

use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to 
measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not 
available, fair value measurement is based upon models that 
generally use market-based or independently sourced market 
parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment 
speeds, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when 
observable market data is limited or not available, fair value 
estimates are typically determined using internally-developed 
models based on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to 
determine fair value are validated in accordance with Company 
policies by an internal model validation group. Additionally, we 
use third-party pricing services to obtain fair values, which are 
used to either record the price of an instrument or to 
corroborate internally-developed prices. Third-party price 
validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of 
the fair value measurements. 

When using internally-developed models based on 

unobservable inputs, management judgment is necessary as we 
are required to make judgments about significant assumptions 
market participants would use to estimate fair value. 
Determination of these assumptions includes consideration of 
market conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market 
conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or 
changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the 
availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data 
used to determine fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate 
to adjust available quoted prices or observable market data. For 
example, we may adjust a price received from a third-party 
pricing service using internal models based on discounted cash 

flows when the impact of illiquid markets has not already been 
incorporated in the fair value measurement. Additionally, for 
certain residential LHFS and certain debt and equity securities 
where the significant inputs have become unobservable due to 
illiquid markets and a third-party pricing service is not used, our 
discounted cash flow model uses a discount rate that reflects 
what we believe a market participant would require in light of the 
illiquid market. 

We continually assess the level and volume of market 
activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining 
adjustments, if any, to price quotes. Given market conditions can 
change over time, our determination of which securities markets 
are considered active or inactive can change. If we determine a 
market to be inactive, the degree to which price quotes require 
adjustment, can also change. 

Significant judgment is also required to determine whether 
certain assets measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 or 
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this judgment, 
we consider available information, including observable market 
data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our 
understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
used to estimate fair value. The classification as Level 2 or Level 3 
is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each 
instrument or instrument category and judgments are made 
regarding the significance of unobservable inputs to each 
instrument’s fair value measurement in its entirety. If 
unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is 
classified as Level 3.

fair value on a recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities

techniques and the impact to our financial statements. 

Income Taxes 
We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we 
operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: 
current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax 
expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded 
for the current period and includes income tax expense related to 
uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that 
management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of 

99 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our 
realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet 
method and deferred income tax expense results from changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the 
balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is 
based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and 
tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes 
in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred 
tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment 
that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance 
reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. 

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

are complex and subject to different interpretations by 
management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In 
establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make 
judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax 
laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future 
certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax 
jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review 
during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise 
over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these 
disputes during the tax examination and audit process and 
ultimately through the court systems when applicable. 

We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate 

of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and 
their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a 
quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income 
taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from 
the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our 
estimates may be material to our operating results for any given 
quarter. 

See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes 
and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses 
The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, 
governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or 
investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its 
business activities, and many of those proceedings and 
investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss. 
We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses 
associated with the actions become probable and the costs can 
be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the 
amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of 
potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if 
we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low 
end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of 
resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than 
the amounts accrued for those actions. 

We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for 

potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing 
the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. 
Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of 
reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for 
probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding 
of information currently available related to the legal evaluation 
and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on 
these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and 
senior management. These matters may be in various stages of 
investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a 
wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and 
jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was 
not considered or was considered remote in anticipated 

100 

occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will 
change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject 

to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to 
determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also 
inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there 
may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably 
possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses 
may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of 
reasonably possible loss. 

See Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for further information. 

Goodwill Impairment 
We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or 
more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors 
warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-
term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue 
generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by 
regulators, and company specific factors such as a decline in 
market capitalization. In first and second quarter 2020, we 
performed interim, quantitative impairment assessments of our 
goodwill and concluded that there was no impairment of 
goodwill. In third quarter 2020, we performed a qualitative 
assessment of goodwill impairment and concluded that it was 
more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units 
were greater than their carrying amounts as of 
September 30, 2020. 

In 2020, we reorganized our management reporting 
structure, which resulted in newly defined reportable operating 
segments. We identify reporting units to be assessed for 
goodwill impairment at the reportable operating segment level 
or one level below. Goodwill balances were allocated to the 
reporting units based on the relative fair value of realigned 
businesses. 

For our quantitative goodwill impairment assessments, we 
calculate carrying amounts as net equity for each reporting unit 
based on allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other 
intangible assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under 
a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of 
our regulatory capital requirements. The estimated fair values of 
the reporting units are established based on a balanced 
weighting of fair values using both an income approach and a 
market approach and are intended to reflect Company 
performance and expectations as well as external market 
conditions. The methodologies for calculating carrying amounts 
and estimating fair values are periodically assessed by senior 
management and revised as necessary. 

The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) 
analysis, which uses the present value of future cash flows 
associated with each reporting unit to estimate fair value. There 
is significant judgment applied in a DCF analysis based on 
financial forecasts for our lines of business, which include future 
expectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, 
and assumptions related to future business activities. The near-
term forecasts are reviewed by senior management and the 
Board as part of our annual budgeting process. For periods after 
our financial forecasts, we use a terminal value calculation based 
on an assumed long-term growth rate. We apply a discount rate 
to these forecasted cash flows using the capital asset pricing 
model which produces an estimated cost of equity specific to 
that reporting unit. The discount rates used in our fourth quarter 
2020 assessment, which ranged from 10% to 12%, were intended 
to reflect the risks and uncertainties in the financial markets and 
in our internally generated business projections. 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 10% or 
higher based on forecasts and valuations. Although the fair value 
of our Commercial Banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying 
amount by over 20%, it was the most sensitive to adverse 
changes in valuation assumptions. An adverse change to 
valuation assumptions could result in an impairment of the 
goodwill allocated to the Commercial Banking reporting unit, 
which was $2.9 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Declines in our ability to generate revenue, significant 
increases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions 
from regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill 
impairment in a future period. Given the uncertainty of the 
severity or length of the current economic downturn, we will 
continue to monitor our performance against our internal 
forecasts as well as market conditions for circumstances that 
could have a further negative effect on the estimated fair values 
of our reporting units. 

For additional information on goodwill and our reportable 

operating segments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 10 (Intangible Assets), and Note 26 
(Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The market approach utilizes observable market data from 

comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings 
or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting 
unit’s fair value. The market data is adjusted with a control 
premium that would be applied in a hypothetical acquisition of 
the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in the selection 
of comparable companies for each reporting unit based on the 
similarity of peer business activities to those of the applicable 
reporting unit. 

The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our 

market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2020 assessment. 
Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to 
this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid 
to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the 
Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in 
the price of the Company’s common stock, (iii) market position 
or opportunities that a potential buyer would take into 
consideration when estimating the fair value of an individual 
reporting unit, (iv) a higher degree of complexity and execution 
risk at the Company level, compared with the individual reporting 
unit level, and (v) risks or benefits at the Company level that may 
not be reflected in the fair value of the individual reporting units. 
Based on our fourth quarter 2020 assessment, there was no 
impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2020. The fair value of 

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 52 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 52:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description 

Effective date and financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 
The Update requires all features in 
long-duration insurance contracts 
that meet the definition of a market 
risk benefit to be measured at fair 
value through earnings with changes 
in fair value attributable to our own 
credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. The Update 
requires the use of a standardized 
discount rate and routine updates for 
insurance assumptions used in valuing 
the liability for future policy benefits 
for traditional long-duration 
contracts. The Update also simplifies 
the amortization of deferred 
acquisition costs. 

ASU 2020-11, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application, issued in fourth 
quarter 2020, delayed the effective date of this standard to January 1, 2023. Certain of our variable annuity 
reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the associated insurance 
related reserves to be measured at fair value as of the earliest period presented, with the cumulative effect of 
the difference between fair value and carrying value, excluding the effect of our own credit, to be recognized in 
the opening balance of retained earnings. The cumulative effect on fair value for changes attributable to our 
own credit risk will be recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of 
December 31, 2020, we held $1.2 billion in insurance-related reserves of which $588 million was in scope of 
the Update. A total of $531 million was associated with products that meet the definition of market risk 
benefits, and of this amount, $26 million was measured at fair value under current accounting standards. The 
market risk benefits are primarily indexed to U.S. equity and fixed income markets. Upon adoption, we may 
incur periodic earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the long 
duration of these contracts. We plan to economically hedge this volatility, where feasible. The ultimate impact 
of these changes will depend on the composition of our market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption. 
Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts and 
deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding long-duration contracts on the basis of their 
existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period presented, and are not expected to be 
material.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) 
the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, 
including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services;

developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in this Report. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For more information about factors that could cause actual 

results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this Report, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company. 

ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND 
LIQUIDITY RISKS 

Our financial results have been, and will continue to be, 
materially affected by general economic conditions, and a 
deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial 
markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other 
businesses and our financial results and condition.  We 
generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the 
loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial 
amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest 
income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and 
commercial lending and banking businesses, including our 
mortgage banking business. These businesses have been, and will 
continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. 
economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. The 
negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S. 
fiscal and political matters, including concerns about deficit and 
debt levels, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may 
continue to impact the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical 
matters, including international political unrest or disturbances, 
the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, as well as 
continued concerns over commodity prices, restrictions on 
international trade and corresponding retaliatory measures, and 
global economic difficulties, may impact the stability of financial 
markets and the global economy. In particular, the United 
Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could increase 
economic barriers between the United Kingdom and the 
European Union, limit our ability to conduct business in the 
European Union, impose additional costs on us, subject us to 
different laws, regulations and/or regulatory authorities, or 
adversely impact our business, financial results and operating 
model. Although we have transitioned certain of our operations 
to countries within the European Union, there is no guarantee 
that we will be able to operate or conduct business in the 
European Union in the same manner or with the same 
effectiveness as before the United Kingdom’s exit. A prolonged 
period of slow growth in the global economy, particularly in the 
U.S., or any deterioration in general economic conditions and/or 
the financial markets resulting from the above matters or any 
other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the global 
economy, could materially adversely affect our financial results 
and condition. 

A weakening in business or economic conditions, including 
higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, can also 
adversely affect our borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, which 
can negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment 
levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur 
elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our 
allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely 
affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial 
and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely 
on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating 
economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to 

104 

repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the 
largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur 
significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or 
deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for 
us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by 
making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. 
Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition 
and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our 
loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower 
yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If 
economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the 
economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would 
likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence 
and spending, the demand for our credit products, including our 
mortgages, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest 
income and our earnings. 

A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which 

may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our 
investment advisory, mutual fund, securities brokerage, wealth 
management, and investment banking businesses. For example, 
because investment management fees are often based on the 
value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of 
those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock 
market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, 
reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our 
brokerage business. In addition, adverse market conditions may 
negatively affect the performance of products we have provided 
to customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional 
costs. The U.S. stock market experienced significant volatility in 
2020 and there is no guarantee that high price levels will 
continue or that price levels will stabilize. Poor economic 
conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets also can 
negatively affect our debt and equity underwriting and advisory 
businesses, as well as our trading activities and venture capital 
businesses. Any deterioration in global financial markets and 
economies, including as a result of any international political 
unrest or disturbances, may adversely affect the revenues and 
earnings of our international operations, particularly our global 
financial institution and correspondent banking services. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” 
sections in this Report. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business 
and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on 
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic 
and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to 
the pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively 
impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, 
affected equity market valuations, created significant volatility 
and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment 
levels. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in restrictions and 
closures for many businesses, as well as the institution of social 
distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states 
and communities. As a result, the demand for our products and 
services may continue to be significantly impacted, which could 
adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, the pandemic could 
continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan 
portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
particularly for industries most directly and adversely affected by 
the pandemic, such as travel and entertainment, and/or if 
businesses remain closed, the impact on the global economy 
worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek 
additional loans to help finance their businesses. Similarly, 
because of changing economic and market conditions affecting 
issuers, we may be required to recognize further impairments on 
the securities we hold, as well as reductions in other 
comprehensive income. Moreover, the persistence of adverse 
economic conditions and reduced revenue may adversely affect 
the fair value of our operating segments and underlying 
reporting units which may result in the impairment of goodwill or 
other long-lived assets. Our business operations may be further 
disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to 
work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, 
government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the 
pandemic, and we have already temporarily closed certain of our 
branches and offices. 

Moreover, the pandemic has created additional operational 

and compliance risks, including the need to quickly implement 
and execute new programs and procedures for the products and 
services we offer our customers, provide enhanced safety 
measures for our employees and customers, comply with rapidly 
changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of 
fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of 
our systems, networks and operations while a larger number of 
our employees and those of our third-party service providers 
work remotely. The pandemic could also result in or contribute to 
additional downgrades to our credit ratings or credit outlook. In 
response to the pandemic, we have temporarily suspended 
certain mortgage foreclosure activities, and provided fee waivers, 
payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for mortgage, 
credit card, auto, small business, personal and commercial 
lending customers, and future governmental actions may require 
these and other types of customer-related responses. Our 
participation in governmental measures taken to address the 
economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in 
reputational harm, as well as continue to result in litigation and 
government investigations and proceedings. In addition, we 
reduced our common stock dividend and temporarily suspended 
share repurchases, and we could take, or be required to take, 
other capital actions in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic may 
also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or 
magnitude of the other risks described herein, including credit, 
market and operational related risks, particularly if the pandemic 
continues to adversely affect the global economy. The extent to 
which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory 
capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, 
which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the 
scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness, 
availability and use of vaccines, and actions taken by 
governmental authorities and other third parties in response to 
the pandemic. 

Changes in interest rates and financial market values could 
reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our 
other comprehensive income, including as a result of 
recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we 
hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Changes in 
either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning 
assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the 
February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net 
interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can 
affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our 

assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction 
in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster 
than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or 
contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on 
our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than 
our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract. 

The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect 
our yield and net interest margin. We hold earning assets in the 
form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. 
As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower 
demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our net 
interest income and yield. In addition, our net interest income 
and net interest margin can be negatively affected by a 
prolonged low interest rate environment as it may result in us 
holding lower yielding loans and securities on our consolidated 
balance sheet, particularly if we are unable to replace the 
maturing higher yielding assets with similar higher yielding 
assets. Increases in interest rates, however, may negatively affect 
loan demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers 
may have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As 
described below, changes in interest rates also affect our 
mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. 

Changes in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread 

between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also 
reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is 
upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-
term rates. When the yield curve flattens, or even inverts, our net 
interest margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term 
funding increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-
term assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in 
which interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net 
interest margin and net interest income due to a likely decline in 
the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, 
while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with 
the FRB. 

The interest we earn on our loans may be tied to U.S.-
denominated interest rates such as the federal funds rate while 
the interest we pay on our debt may be based on international 
rates such as LIBOR. If the federal funds rate were to fall without 
a corresponding decrease in LIBOR, we might earn less on our 
loans without any offsetting decrease in our funding costs. This 
could lower our net interest margin and our net interest income. 
We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on 

our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on 
assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may 
hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate 
derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our 
mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as 
their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based 
on changes in interest rates. 

We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There 
is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or 
option volatility could reduce our net interest income and 
earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material 
amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially 
different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates 
rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve 
changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we 
hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may 
rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and 
loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We 
may incur losses when we take such actions. 

We hold debt and equity securities, including U.S. Treasury 

and federal agency securities and federal agency MBS, securities

Risk Factors (continued) 

of U.S. states and political subdivisions, residential and 
commercial MBS, corporate debt securities, other asset-backed 
securities and marketable equity securities, including securities 
relating to our venture capital activities. Because of changing 
economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, 
affecting issuers and the performance of any collateral 
underlying the securities, we may be required to recognize other-
than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the 
securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securities 
we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer 
creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is 
exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection 
with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to 
accommodate the investment and risk management activities of 
our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities and 
equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value with 
realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest 
income. As part of our business to support our customers, we 
trade public debt and equity securities that are subject to market 
fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income. In 
addition, although high market volatility can increase our 
exposure to trading-related losses, periods of low volatility may 
have an adverse effect on our businesses as a result of reduced 
customer activity levels. Although we have processes in place to 
measure and monitor the risks associated with our trading 
activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there 
can be no assurance that our processes and strategies will be 
effective in avoiding losses that could have a material adverse 
effect on our financial results. 

The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity 
securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable 
equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and 
losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are 
carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement 
alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized 
gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity 
securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may 
have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. 
When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of 
factors, including general economic and market conditions, the 
prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company 
goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, 
and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. 

Nonmarketable equity securities include our private equity 
and venture capital investments that could result in significant 
OTTI losses for those investments carried under the 
measurement alternative or equity method. If we determine 
there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying 
value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings, which 
could be significant. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk”, “– Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk”, “– Market Risk – Trading 
Activities”, and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the 
“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2 
(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 6 (Equity Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Uncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offered 
Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Central banks and global 

106 

regulators have called for financial market participants to 
prepare for the discontinuation of LIBOR. The administrator of 
LIBOR published a consultation regarding its intention to cease 
the publication of LIBOR after December 31, 2021, with the 
exception of certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR that it proposed 
would remain available for use in legacy contracts or as otherwise 
enumerated by financial regulators until June 30, 2023. We have 
a significant number of assets and liabilities referenced to LIBOR 
and other interbank offered rates such as commercial loans, 
adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and 
long-term debt. When any such benchmark rate or other 
referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or 
discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market 
benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or 
differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or 
payment amount depending on the terms of the governing 
instrument. 

This could impact the financial performance of previously 

booked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we 
hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective 
or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall 
interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating-
rate funding, affect our capital and liquidity planning and 
management, or have other adverse financial consequences. 
There can be no assurance that the transition to a new 
benchmark rate or other financial metric will be an adequate 
alternative to LIBOR or produce the economic equivalent of 
LIBOR. In addition, the transition to using any new benchmark 
rate or other financial metric may require changes to existing 
transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, and 
pricing processes, require substantial changes to existing 
documentation and the renegotiation of a substantial volume of 
previously booked transactions, and could result in significant 
operational, systems, or other practical challenges, increased 
compliance and operational costs, heightened expectations and 
scrutiny from regulators, litigation, reputational harm, or other 
adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that we will be 
able to modify all existing documentation or renegotiate all 
previously booked transactions before the discontinuation of 
LIBOR. Furthermore, the transition away from widely used 
benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or other 
market participants challenging the determination of their 
interest payments, disputing the interpretation or 
implementation of contract “fallback” provisions and other 
transition related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or 
postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our 
revenue and adversely affect our business. Moreover, to the 
extent borrowers with loans referenced to LIBOR, such as 
adjustable rate mortgage loans, experience higher interest 
payments as a result of the transition to a new benchmark rate, 
our customers’ ability to repay their loans may be adversely 
affected, which can negatively impact our credit performance. 

For additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR 
and the steps we are taking to address and mitigate the risks we 
have identified, refer to the “Overview – Recent Developments – 
LIBOR Transition” section in this Report. 

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation 
of our business, and our financial results and condition could be 
materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage 
our liquidity.  We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a 
low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and 
the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, 
our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, 
our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the 
FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and 
international money through capital markets. 

Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our 
inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market 
disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which 
are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury 
securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity 
that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in 
interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase 
our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could 
materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack 
of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative 
news about the Company or the financial services industry 
generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or 
negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our 
inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or 
volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our 
short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or 
restrictions; and, as described below, reductions in one or more of 
our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors may 
be caused by events over which we have little or no control. There 
can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in 
the financial markets will not occur in the future. For example, 
concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and currency 
prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause financial 
market volatility. 

In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels 
and any associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings 
may cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the 
sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt 
ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as 
well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing 
economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely 
affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that 
we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for 
borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable 
terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the 
operation of our business and our financial results and condition. 
As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our 
funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial 
services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the 
rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either 
because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we 
lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of 
funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms 
of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive 
alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a 
better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of 
bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a 
relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs 
and negatively affecting our liquidity. 

If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through 
customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms 
or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail 
to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intra-day or 
intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, financial 
results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As we 
did during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be required by 

our regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuance of 
common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock 
dividend to preserve capital or to raise additional capital. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. 

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material 
adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and 
condition.  Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are 
influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our 
credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds 
and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could 
cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral 
requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect 
our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings 
agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of 
many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital 
adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and 
quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, 
and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit 
ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other 
external factors, including market volatility and concerns or 
perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There 
can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and 
outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would 
not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing 
costs. 

Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger additional 
collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our 
liquidity, including as a result of credit-related contingent 
features in certain of our derivative contracts. Although a one or 
two notch downgrade in our current credit ratings would not be 
expected to trigger a material increase in our collateral or funding 
obligations, a more severe credit rating downgrade of our long-
term and short-term credit ratings could increase our collateral 
or funding obligations and the effect on our liquidity could be 
material. 

For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk 

Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and 
Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and 
federal and state law, as well as certain contractual 
arrangements, can limit those dividends.  Wells Fargo & 
Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a 
separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives 
substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and 
other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these 
dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends 
on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on 
our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends 
and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank 
subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to 
the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated 
June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, 
among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo 
Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other direct and indirect 

107

Risk Factors (continued) 

subsidiaries of the Parent designated as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes or identified as related support 
entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be restricted from 
making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/ 
or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent’s 
board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of 
assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject 
to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. 

For more information, refer to the “Regulation and 
Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company 
Structure” sections in our 2020 Form 10-K and to Note 28 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

REGULATORY RISKS 

Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require 
us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our 
revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or 
otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or 
competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary 
banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those 
related to our brokerage and mutual fund businesses, are subject 
to significant and extensive regulation under state and federal 
laws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of the various 
jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where they conduct business. 
These regulations protect depositors, federal deposit insurance 
funds, consumers, investors, employees, and the banking and 
financial system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. 
Economic, market and political conditions during the past few 
years have led to a significant amount of legislation and 
regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services 
industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of 
financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws 
and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we 
do business and the products and services that we provide, affect 
or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our 
ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our 
revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, 
increase our capital requirements, impose additional fees, 
assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision 
of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our 
business operations or have other negative consequences. Our 
businesses and revenues in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject 
to risks from political, economic and social developments in 
those jurisdictions, including sanctions or business restrictions, 
asset freezes or confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic 
developments, or financial or social instability. In addition, 
greater government oversight and scrutiny of financial services 
companies has increased our operational and compliance costs as 
we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing 
our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory 
standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory 
requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions, could result in fees, penalties, restrictions 
on our ability to engage in certain business activities, or other 
adverse consequences. 

Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, 

credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending 
businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly 
complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as 
enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory 
examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s 
rules may continue to increase our compliance costs and require 

108 

changes in our business practices, which could limit or negatively 
affect the products and services that we offer our customers. If 
we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and 
expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may 
be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our 
business activities including the products and services we can 
provide, and/or harm to our reputation. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a 

comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter 
derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based 
swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to 
negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter 
derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives 
or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for 
engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives 
activities. 

We are also subject to various rules and regulations related 
to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, 
including the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001. These rules and 
regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies 
and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery 
and corruption, fraud, compliance, suspicious activities, currency 
transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. Although 
we have policies and procedures designed to comply with these 
rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully effective or 
do not meet heightened regulatory standards or expectations, 
we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain 
activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. 

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations 
enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental 
authorities relating to the privacy of the information of 
customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, 
among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a 
significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, 
sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data 
breaches; and provide for significantly increased penalties for 
non-compliance. 

In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders 

and regulatory agreements with certain of our regulators, 
including a February 2018 consent order with the FRB regarding 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. This consent order limits the Company’s total 
consolidated assets as defined under the consent order to the 
level as of December 31, 2017, until certain conditions are met. 
This limitation could continue to adversely affect our results of 
operations or financial condition. We are also subject to April 
2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC regarding the 
Company’s compliance risk management program and past 
practices involving certain automobile collateral protection 
insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock 
extensions.

 Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank 
remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in 
November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain 
non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors 
and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain 
regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain 
individuals and employees. 

The Company may be subject to further actions, including 

the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory 
agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators 
regarding similar or other issues. Compliance with the February 
2018 FRB consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
orders, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as 
well as the implementation of their requirements, may continue 
to increase the Company’s costs, require the Company to 
reallocate resources away from growing its existing businesses, 
negatively impact the Company’s capital and liquidity, and 
require the Company to undergo significant changes to its 
business, products and services. For more information on the 
February 2018 FRB consent order and the April 2018 CFPB and 
OCC consent orders, refer to the “Regulatory Matters” section in 
this Report. 

Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly 

affect our business include proposals to reform the housing 
finance market in the United States. These proposals, among 
other things, consider ending the conservatorships of the GSEs 
and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in 
buying mortgage loans or guaranteeing mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS), as well as the implementation of reforms 
relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage 
market. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the 
adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home 
mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company’s 
business and financial results, are uncertain. 

Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, 
also could significantly change our regulatory environment and 
increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may 
pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings 
associations, credit unions, and other financial services 
companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results and condition. 

For more information on the significant regulations and 
regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect 
our business, refer to the “Regulatory Matters” section in this 
Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2020 
Form 10-K. 

We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities 
or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or 
recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB 
and the FDIC, Wells Fargo has prepared and submitted a 
resolution plan, also known as a “living will,” that is designed to 
facilitate our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material 
financial distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the 
FRB or FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution 
plans. If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that our resolution plan 
has deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, 
leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, 
activities or operations until we adequately remedy the 
deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we 
have been unable to remedy any deficiencies, they could require 
us to divest certain assets or operations. On December 17, 2019, 
the FRB and FDIC announced that the Company’s 2019 
resolution plan did not have any deficiencies, but they identified a 
specific shortcoming that would need to be addressed. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a range of 
options that we may consider during times of idiosyncratic or 
systemic economic stress to remedy any financial weaknesses 
and restore market confidence without extraordinary 
government support. The Bank must also prepare and submit to 
the OCC a recovery plan. If either the FRB or the OCC determines 
that our recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, 
restrictions on our business or ultimately require us to divest 
assets. 

Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of 
Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. 
If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 
important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 
default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation 
authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would 
determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and 
obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation 
authority requires that security holders of a company in 
receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to 
any losses, and allows the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of 
creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain 
circumstances. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would likely 
be the only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, we are not obligated to maintain a single point of entry 
strategy, and the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an 
orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 
2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended 
and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with 
WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and 
subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, and certain other 
direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Parent. Pursuant to the 
Support Agreement, the Parent transferred a significant amount 
of its assets to the IHC and will continue to transfer assets to the 
IHC from time to time. In the event of our material financial 
distress or failure, the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred 
assets to provide capital and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain 
other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the 
Support Agreement, the IHC will provide funding and liquidity to 
the Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of 
credit. If certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined 
triggers, or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a 
case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes 
would be forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, 
and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be 
restricted, any of which could materially and adversely impact the 

109 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Risk Factors (continued) 

Parent’s liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other 
obligations, and could result in the commencement of 
bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than 
might have otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were 
not implemented. 

Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on 
shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the 
Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. 
Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive 
significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s 
security holders could face significant or complete losses. This 
outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly 
liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted 
using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of 
entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its 
subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution 
proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple 
point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries 
could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s 
security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved 
to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses 
than if the strategy had not been implemented. 

For more information, refer to the “Regulatory Matters – 
‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this 
Report. 

Bank regulations and rules may require higher capital and 
liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock 
dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our 
business, or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository 
institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In 
particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal 
banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital 
requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, 
among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating 
capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal 
banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a leverage 
ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like 
Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions. The FRB has 
also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and 
unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its 
resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss 
absorbing capacity (TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators 
have issued final rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio 
and a net stable funding ratio. 

In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced 
capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms 
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital 
plan rule that establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations 
implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs 
like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk 
and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and 
imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators 
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the 
United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules 
implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and 
national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to 
establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress and has proposed additional requirements 

110 

regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, 
including its expectations for boards of directors and senior 
management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also 
established heightened governance and risk management 
standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. 

The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, 

liquidity, TLAC, and capital planning requirements may limit or 
otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common 
stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us to 
increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that we 
increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or 
liquidity, including as a result of business growth, acquisitions or a 
change in our risk profile, could require us to liquidate assets or 
otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or 
investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial 
results. Although not currently anticipated, proposed capital 
requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise 
additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock 
may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, 
federal banking regulations may continue to increase our 
compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our 
business or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers. 

For more information, refer to the “Capital Management,” 
“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk 
and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” 
sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” 
section in our 2020 Form 10-K. 

FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can 
significantly affect business and economic conditions and our 
financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of 
money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part 
our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we 
earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our 
net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest 
rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial 
instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In 
addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially 
increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. 
Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal 
funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its 
balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. 
As noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and 
a flattening yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions 
could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest 
margin as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and debt 
securities on our consolidated balance sheet. 

CREDIT RISKS 

Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in 
economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could 
require us to increase our provision for credit losses and 
allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit 
risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. 
As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance 
of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results 
and condition. As noted above, if the current economic 
environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may 
have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which 
could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for 
credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this 
allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in 
our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The 
process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to 
our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective 
and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of 
economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of 
our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the 
allowance because of changing economic conditions, including 
falling home prices and higher unemployment, significant loan 
growth, changes in consumer behavior or other market 
conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. 
Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such 
as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social 
matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit 
losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit 
losses. 

Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses 
was appropriate at December 31, 2020, there is no assurance 
that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if 
housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of 
significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we 
experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build 
reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. 
For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. 

We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the 
extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry 
segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or 
collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our 
loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or 
similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group 
may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 
market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market 
conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or 
geography may also impact related or dependent industries or 
the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in 
such industries to meet their financial obligations. We 
experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 
when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential 
real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater 
than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in 
many markets, including the Central Valley California market and 
several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As 
California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and 
deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying 
economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California 
could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes 
in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as in 
response to climate change and other environmental and 
sustainability concerns, may adversely affect borrowers in certain 
industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and 
reduce the demand by these borrowers for our products and 
services. Moreover, deterioration in macro-economic conditions 
generally across the country could result in materially higher 
credit losses, including for our residential real estate loan 
portfolio, which includes nonconforming mortgage loans we 
retain on our balance sheet. We may experience higher 
delinquencies and higher loss rates as our consumer real estate 

secured lines of credit reach their contractual end of draw period 
and begin to amortize. 

We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. A 
deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects the 
business performance of our CRE borrowers, including increases 
in interest rates, declines in commercial property values, and/or 
changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions, could 
result in materially higher credit losses and have a material 
adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 

Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions 

may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material 
adverse effect on our credit performance and results of 
operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively 
affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. 
operations. 

Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain 

derivative transactions through central counterparty 
clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these 
CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we 
may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the 
CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults 
on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-
performance by our clients for which we clear transactions 
through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not 
sufficiently covered by available collateral. 

In order to reduce credit risk and obtain additional funding, 

from time to time we may securitize or sell similar types or 
categories of loans that we originate, such as mortgage loans and 
auto loans. The agreements under which we do this generally 
contain various representations and warranties regarding the 
origination and characteristics of the loans. We may be required 
to repurchase the loans, reimburse investors and others, or incur 
other losses, including regulatory fines and penalties, as a result 
of any breaches in these contractual representations and 
warranties. For more information about our repurchase 
obligations with respect to mortgage loans, refer to the “Risk 
Factors – Risks Related to Our Mortgage Business” section in this 
Report. 

For more information regarding credit risk, refer to the “Risk 

Management – Credit Risk Management” section and Note 4 
(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC AND LEGAL RISKS 

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, 
controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors 
and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, 
damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  As 
a large financial institution that serves customers through 
numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking 
and other distribution channels across the U.S. and 
internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and 
monitor a large number of customer transactions on a 
continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have 
expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have 
increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide 
products and services to our customers, and as customer, public, 
legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and 
information security have increased, our operational systems, 
controls and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and 
monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. 
Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or 
other operating systems and facilities may stop operating 

111 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk Factors (continued) 

properly, become insufficient based on our evolving business 
needs, or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of 
factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our 
control. For example, there could be sudden increases in 
customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications 
outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile 
banking availability; climate change related impacts and natural 
disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease 
pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or 
social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, 
cyber attacks or other information security breaches. 
Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our infrastructure 
or operating systems may be time-consuming, entail significant 
costs, and create risks associated with implementing new 
systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the 
complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process 
of enhancing our infrastructure and operating systems, including 
their security measures and controls, can itself create a risk of 
system disruptions and security issues. Similarly, we may not be 
able to timely recover critical business processes or operations 
that have been disrupted, which may further increase any 
associated costs and consequences of such disruptions. Although 
we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place 
to help provide operational resiliency, our business operations 
may be adversely affected by significant and widespread 
disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems 
that support our businesses and customers. For example, on 
February 7, 2019, we experienced system issues caused by an 
automatic power shutdown at one of our main data center 
facilities. Although applications and related workloads were 
systematically re-routed to back-up data centers throughout the 
day, certain of our services, including our online and mobile 
banking systems, certain mortgage origination systems, and 
certain ATM functions, experienced disruptions that delayed 
service to our customers. 

As a result of financial institutions and technology systems 

becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational 
incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material 
impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, 
third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as 
exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors 
that provide services or security solutions for our operations, 
could also be sources of operational risk to us, including from 
information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or failures 
of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies in the 
performance of their responsibilities. We are also exposed to the 
risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common 
service provider to those third parties could impede their ability 
to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In 
addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and 
expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, 
and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their 
obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, 
regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, 
restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences. 

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls 

or operating systems that support our businesses and 
customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to 
adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform 
their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or 
oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business 
disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable 
privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse 

112 

consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition. 

A cyber attack or other information security breach of our 
technologies, computer systems or networks, or those of our 
third-party vendors and other service providers, could disrupt 
our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of 
confidential or proprietary information, damage our 
reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  Information 
security risks for large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo 
have generally increased in recent years in part because of the 
proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile 
devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, 
and the increased sophistication and activities of organized 
crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, 
including foreign state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may 
continue to attempt to misrepresent personal or financial 
information to obtain loans or other financial products from us or 
attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other 
users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order 
to gain access to our data or that of our customers. As noted 
above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission 
and storage of confidential information in our computer systems 
and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and 
capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, 
computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks 
to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products 
and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, 
tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control 
systems. Although we believe we have robust information 
security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, 
networks, and our customers’ devices may become the target of 
cyber attacks or other information security breaches that could 
result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, 
loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ 
confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise 
disrupt Wells Fargo’s or its customers’ or other third parties’ 
business operations. For example, various retailers have reported 
they were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of 
their customers’ data, including debit and credit card 
information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur 
costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent 
transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed 
to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of 
the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and 
procedures and inappropriately circumvents controls for 
personal gain or other improper purposes. 

Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of 

financial institutions and technology systems, an information 
security incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or 
material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. In 
addition, third parties on which we rely, including those that 
facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource 
operations, such as internet, mobile technology, hardware, 
software, and cloud service providers, could be sources of 
information security risk to us. If those third parties fail to 
adequately or appropriately safeguard their technologies, 
systems, networks, hardware, and software, we may suffer 
material harm, including business disruptions, losses or 
remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, or other adverse consequences. 

To date we have not experienced any material losses relating 

to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but 
there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in 
the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature 
of these threats, the prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and 
its role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to 
implement our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and 
develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our 
customers when and how they want to be served, our geographic 
footprint and international presence, the outsourcing of some of 
our business operations, and the current global economic and 
political environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other 
financial institutions continue to be the target of various evolving 
and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware, ransomware, 
phishing, and denial-of-service, as part of an effort to disrupt the 
operations of financial institutions, potentially test their 
cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, 
proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also 
focused on targeting online applications and services, such as 
online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and 
services provided by third parties, and have targeted the 
infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread 
unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As 
a result, information security and the continued development 
and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems 
designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data 
from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for 
Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in industry 
cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including 
our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to 
continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to 
cybersecurity and other information security threats. As these 
threats continue to evolve, we may continue to be required to 
expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or 
enhance our protective measures or to investigate and 
remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. 
Because the investigation of any information security breach is 
inherently unpredictable and would require time to complete, we 
may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a 
breach, which may further increase any associated costs and 
consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers 
aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be 
sufficient to cover all losses associated with an information 
security breach. 

Cyber attacks or other information security breaches 
affecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that 
facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource 
operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or 
devices that our customers use to access our products and 
services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or 
customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other 
costs, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational 
damage, or other adverse consequences, any of which could 
materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial 
condition. 

Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in 
mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework 
seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established 
processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, 
monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are 
subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest 
rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 
management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, 
identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also 

dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a 
sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to 
develop effective operational controls or to foster the 
appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the 
inability to align performance management and compensation to 
achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we 
are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we 
may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We are 
also exposed to risks if we do not accurately or completely 
execute a process or transaction, whether due to human error or 
otherwise, or if an employee fails to comply with applicable 
policies and procedures or inappropriately circumvents controls. 
In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor and 
predict risks, such as market, interest rate and credit risks, as well 
as to help inform business decisions; however, there is no 
assurance that these models will appropriately or sufficiently 
capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future events or 
exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are subject to 
regulatory review and approval, and any failure to meet 
regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, 
penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business 
activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required 
modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital 
ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and 
compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and 
assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any 
issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our 
aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could 
result in ineffective risk management practices, business 
decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or 
inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use 
artificial intelligence to help further inform our business decisions 
and risk management practices, but there is no assurance that 
artificial intelligence will appropriately or sufficiently replicate 
certain outcomes or accurately predict future events or 
exposures. Previous financial and credit crises and resulting 
regulatory reforms highlighted both the importance and some of 
the limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our 
regulators remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions 
build and maintain robust risk management policies and 
practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, 
we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory 
proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to 
sales practices and other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm.  Various government entities and 
offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, 
investigations or examinations arising out of certain sales 
practices of the Company, and various non-governmental parties 
have filed lawsuits against us seeking damages or other remedies 
related to these sales practices. The Company has entered into 
various settlements to resolve certain of these investigations 
and proceedings, as a result of which we have incurred monetary 
penalties, costs, and restrictions. In connection with any still 
pending matters, we may incur additional monetary penalties 
and other sanctions or be required to make admissions of 
wrongdoing and comply with other conditions, which can lead to 
restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities 
or offer certain products or services, limitations on our ability to 
access capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the 
loss of customers, and/or other direct and indirect adverse 
consequences. The ultimate resolution of any of these pending 

113 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk Factors (continued) 

legal proceedings or government investigations, depending on 
the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
We may continue to incur additional costs and expenses in order 
to address and defend these pending legal proceedings and 
government investigations, and we may continue to have 
increased compliance and other costs related to these matters. 
Furthermore, negative publicity or public opinion resulting from 
these matters may increase the risk of reputational harm to our 
business, which can impact our ability to keep and attract 
customers, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified 
employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material 
adverse effects on our results of operations and financial 
condition. 

Furthermore, we may identify other areas or instances 
where customers may have experienced financial harm, including 
as a result of our continuing efforts to rebuild trust and to 
strengthen our risk and control infrastructure. For example, we 
have identified certain issues related to past practices involving 
certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and 
certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed 
automobile protection waiver or insurance agreements. The 
identification of such other areas or instances where customers 
may have experienced financial harm could lead to, and in some 
cases has already resulted in, additional remediation costs, loss of 
revenue or customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, 
compliance and other costs, reputational damage, or other 
adverse consequences. 

For more information, refer to the “Overview – Retail Sales 

Practices Matters” and “– Other Customer Remediation 
Activities” sections and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We may incur fines, penalties and other negative 
consequences from regulatory violations or from any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We maintain 
systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to 
heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and 
expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasing 
regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject to 
consent orders and agreements with regulators that subject us 
to various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event 
or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping 
investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and 
state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other 
governmental entities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws 
and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate may be 
different or even conflict with each other, such as differences 
between U.S. federal and state law or differences between U.S. 
and non-U.S. laws as to the products and services we may offer 
or other business activities we may engage in, which can lead to 
compliance difficulties or issues. Furthermore, many legal and 
regulatory regimes require us to report transactions and other 
information to regulators and other governmental authorities, 
self-regulatory organizations, exchanges, clearing houses and 
customers. We may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on 
our business, or other negative consequences if we do not timely, 
completely, or accurately provide regulatory reports, customer 
notices or disclosures. Moreover, some legal/regulatory 
frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for 
noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent 
or unintentional and even though there were systems and 
procedures in place at the time designed to ensure compliance. 
For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of 

114 

Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions 
from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the 
governments of certain non-U.S. countries and designated 
nationals of those countries. OFAC may impose penalties or 
restrictions on certain activities for inadvertent or unintentional 
violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the 
violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or 
any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, 
including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent 
orders or regulatory agreements, could result in fees, penalties, 
restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business activities, 
reputational harm, loss of customers or other negative 
consequences. 

Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged 
conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry 
generally, could adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk 
to our business, earnings and capital from negative public 
opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased 
substantially because of our size and profile in the financial 
services industry and sales practices related matters and other 
instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. 
Negative public opinion about the financial services industry 
generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our 
reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. 
Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged 
conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; 
mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan 
origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; 
management of client accounts or investments; lending, 
investing or other business relationships; identification and 
management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, 
obligations and interests with and among our customers; 
environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory 
compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; 
and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use 
of customer information, and from actions taken by government 
regulators and community or other organizations in response to 
that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place 
intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-
party service providers that could potentially harm customers or 
our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and 
procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. 
Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or 
prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our 
business or operations could result in significant reputational 
harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses 
under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one 
business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, 
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain 
members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect 
our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized 
by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use 
of social media by our employees and others, including personal 
blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that 
negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be 
posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or 
have other negative consequences, including as a result of our 
employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized 
manner in various social media outlets. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been 
targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, 
which have included disrupting the operation of our retail 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
banking locations and have resulted in negative public 
commentary about financial institutions, including the fees 
charged for various products and services. Wells Fargo and other 
financial institutions have also been subject to negative publicity 
as a result of providing financial services to or making 
investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder 
concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or 
negative public opinion of the Company specifically or large 
financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and 
adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition. 

If we are unable to develop and execute effective business 
plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our 
competitive standing and results of operations could suffer. 
We are subject to rapid changes in technology, regulation, and 
product innovation, face intense competition for customers, 
sources of revenue, capital, services, qualified employees, and 
other essential business resources, and are subject to heightened 
regulatory expectations particularly with respect to compliance 
and risk management. In order to meet these challenges, we may 
undertake business plans or strategies related to, among other 
things, our organizational structure, our compliance and risk 
management framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types 
of products and services we offer, the types of businesses we 
engage in, the geographies in which we operate, the manner in 
which we serve our clients and customers, the third parties with 
which we do business, and the methods and distribution channels 
by which we offer our products and services. Accomplishing 
these business plans or strategies may be complex, time 
intensive, require significant financial, technological, 
management and other resources, may divert management 
attention and resources away from other areas of the Company, 
and may impact our expenses and ability to generate revenue. 
There is no guarantee that any business plans or strategies, 
including our current efficiency initiatives, will ultimately be 
successful. To the extent we are unable to develop or execute 
effective business plans or strategies or manage change 
effectively, our competitive position, reputation, prospects for 
growth, and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest 
certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture 
may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other 
benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than 
expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain 
customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses 
or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other 
long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets. 

Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our 
products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of 
companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We 
generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we 
can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other 
financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or 
on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals 
will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches 
and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a 
condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to 
be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 
common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may 
cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, 

increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected 
benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in 
higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an 
increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our 
business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability 
to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated 
benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on 
integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing 
businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the 
acquired company or business operates internationally or in a 
geographic location where we do not already have significant 
business operations and/or employees. 

We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences from legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its 
subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, 
arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning 
matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and 
many of those proceedings and investigations expose 
Wells Fargo to potential financial loss. There can be no assurance 
as to the ultimate outcome of any of these legal actions. We 
establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses 
associated with the actions become probable and the costs can 
be reasonably estimated. We may still incur costs for a legal 
action even if we have not established an accrual. In addition, the 
actual cost of resolving a legal action may be substantially higher 
than any amounts accrued for that action. The ultimate 
resolution of a pending legal proceeding or investigation, 
depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory 

oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory 
investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition 
to imposing monetary penalties and other sanctions, regulatory 
authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of 
wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection 
with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, 
loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital 
markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to 
engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects.

MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS 

Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to 
quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, 
and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to 
reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new 
mortgage loans.  We are one of the largest mortgage originators 
and residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn 
revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and 
for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage 
servicing business, we have a sizable portfolio of MSRs. Changes 
in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus 
the fair value of our MSRs. When interest rates fall, borrowers are 
usually more likely to prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing 
them at a lower rate. As the likelihood of prepayment increases, 
the fair value of our MSRs can decrease. We also measure at fair 
value certain residential mortgage loans within LHFS and other 
interests we hold related to residential loan sales and 
securitizations. Similar to other interest-bearing securities, the 
value of these residential mortgage LHFS and other interests 
may be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. For 

115 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk Factors (continued) 

example, if market interest rates increase relative to the yield on 
these residential mortgage LHFS and other interests, their fair 
value may fall. 

When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually 

tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan 
originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs 
can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, 
mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of 
our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting 
revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” 
the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, 
the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value 
of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting 
revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to 
the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible 
that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or 
deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall 
or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase 
in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the 
decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. 

We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of 
our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. 
Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models 
and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. We may 
use hedging instruments that may not perfectly correlate with 
the value or income being hedged. We could incur significant 
losses from our hedging activities. There may be periods where 
we elect not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
mortgage banking interest rate risk. 

We rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase mortgage 

loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on 
government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy 
requirements. In order to meet customer needs, we also 
originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs or 
government insuring agency standards, which are referred to as 
“nonconforming” loans. We generally retain these 
nonconforming loans on our balance sheet. When we retain a 
loan on our balance sheet not only do we keep the credit risk of 
the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could 
be used to generate new loans. If we were unable or unwilling to 
retain nonconforming loans on our balance sheet, whether due to 
regulatory, business or other reasons, our ability to originate new 
nonconforming loans may be reduced, thereby reducing the 
interest income we could earn from these loans. Similarly, if the 
GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce 
their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to 
fund, and thus originate new mortgage loans, could also be 
reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring 
agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or 
guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for 
what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount 
or borrower eligibility). Each of the GSEs is currently in 
conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as conservator. While the FHFA 
has stated that it intends to end the conservatorship, we cannot 
predict if, when or precisely how the conservatorship will end, or 
any associated changes to the GSEs business structure and 
operations that could result. As noted above, there are various 
proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., 
including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The 
impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing 
finance market and the GSEs, including any changes to the GSE’s 

116 

structure, capital requirements, or market presence, as well as 
any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are 
uncertain. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of 
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” and “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” sections in this 
Report. 

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or 
reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in 
contractual representations and warranties, and we may incur 
other losses as a result of real or alleged violations of statutes 
or regulations applicable to the origination of our residential 
mortgage loans.  We often sell residential mortgage loans that 
we originate to various parties, including GSEs, SPEs that issue 
private label MBS, and other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. We 
may also pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans 
which back securities guaranteed by GNMA. The agreements 
under which we sell mortgage loans and the insurance or 
guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain various 
representations and warranties regarding the origination and 
characteristics of the mortgage loans. We may be required to 
repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations 
or warranties. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that 
reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we 
have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan 
repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor 
demand strategies and other external conditions that may 
change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to 
estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is 
subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market 
worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and 
increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant 
additions to the repurchase liability. 

Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we 

originate, borrowers may allege that the origination of the loans 
did not comply with applicable laws or regulations in one or more 
respects and assert such violation as an affirmative defense to 
payment or to the exercise by us of our remedies, including 
foreclosure proceedings, or in an action seeking statutory and 
other damages in connection with such violation. If we are not 
successful in demonstrating that the loans in dispute were 
originated in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations, 
we could become subject to monetary damages and other civil 
penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or 
the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 

Credit Risk Management – Liability for Mortgage Loan 
Repurchase Losses” section in this Report. 

We may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be 
required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors 
for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, 
fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing 
obligations, including our obligations with respect to 
mortgage loan foreclosure actions.  We act as servicer and/or 
master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations 
and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a 
servicer or master servicer for those loans we have certain 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors or 
other third parties, including certain foreclosure obligations or, if 
applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan 
modifications or short-sales, as well as certain servicing 
obligations for properties that fall within a flood zone. If we fail to 
satisfy our servicing obligations, we may face a number of 
consequences, including termination as servicer or master 
servicer, requirements to indemnify the securitization trustee 
against losses from any failure by us to perform our servicing 
obligations, and/or contractual obligations to repurchase a 
mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of 
which could significantly reduce our net servicing income. 

We may incur costs, liabilities to borrowers, title insurers 

and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or other 
adverse consequences if we fail to meet our obligations with 
respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or we experience delays 
in the foreclosure process. Our net servicing income and the fair 
value of our MSRs may be negatively affected to the extent our 
servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure or other 
servicing related costs. We may be subject to fines and other 
sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of 
actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing 
practices, including with respect to our foreclosure, loan 
modification, or forbearance practices or our servicing of flood 
zone properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, 
negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or 
servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable 
remedies, or other enforcement actions. 

For more information, refer to the “Risk Management – 

Credit Risk Management – Liability for Mortgage Loan 
Repurchase Losses” and “– Risks Relating to Servicing Activities,” 
and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential 
Mortgage Servicing Rights” sections and Note 14 (Pledged 
Assets and Collateral) and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

COMPETITIVE RISKS 

We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly 
evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other 
financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is 
undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory 
reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and 
current economic conditions. Our success depends on our ability 
to develop and maintain deep and enduring relationships with 
our customers based on the quality of our customer service, the 
wide variety of products and services that we can offer our 
customers and the ability of those products and services to 
satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the pricing of our 
products and services, the extensive distribution channels 
available for our customers, our innovation, and our reputation. 
Continued or increased competition in any one or all of these 
areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, market 
share and results of operations and/or cause us to increase our 
capital investment in our businesses in order to remain 
competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or reprice our 
products and services from time to time may be limited and 
could be influenced significantly by the current economic, 
regulatory and political environment for large financial 
institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. 
Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services 
that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those 
products and services could result in a loss of customer 
relationships and market share and could materially adversely 
affect our results of operations. 

Continued technological advances and the growth of 

e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository 
institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were 
banking products, and for financial institutions and other 
companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial 
solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and 
payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including 
digital currencies, may diminish the importance of depository 
institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of 
funds between parties. We may not respond effectively to these 
and other competitive threats from existing and new 
competitors and may be forced to sell products at lower prices, 
increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our 
existing products and services, and/or develop new products and 
services to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To 
the extent we are not successful in developing and introducing 
new products and services or responding or adapting to the 
competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we 
may lose customer relationships and our revenue growth and 
results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical 
to the success of our business and failure to do so could 
adversely affect our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is 
heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, 
including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, 
including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, 
capital markets, risk management and technology, the 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also 
seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of 
succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract 
and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide 
competitive compensation, effectively manage employee 
performance and development, and foster a diverse and inclusive 
environment. As a large financial institution and additionally to 
the extent we remain subject to consent orders we may be 
subject to limitations on compensation by our regulators that 
may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain these 
qualified employees, especially if some of our competitors may 
not be subject to these same compensation limitations. If we are 
unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, 
including successors for senior leadership positions, our business 
performance, competitive position and future prospects may be 
adversely affected. 

FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS 

Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, and 
changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or 
applied, could materially affect how we report our financial 
results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental 
to determining and understanding our financial results and 
condition. As described below, some of these policies require use 
of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our 
accounting policies could materially affect our financial 
statements. 

From time to time the FASB and the SEC change the 
financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the 
preparation of our external financial statements. For example, on 
January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 
2016-13 – Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which 
replaced the previous “incurred loss” model for the allowance for 

117 

Wells Fargo & Company 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires 
our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control 
over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual 
report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” 
in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not 
identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any 
given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock 
price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our 
customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could 
affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. 
Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our 
outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their 
independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be 
“independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to 
engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit 
reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC 
rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, 
limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse 
consequences. 

*  *  * 

Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC 

filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely 
affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly 
reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2021 for material 
changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors 
not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could 
adversely affect our financial results and condition. 

Risk Factors (continued) 

credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the 
Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL. 

In addition, accounting standard setters and those who 
interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, 
banking regulators and our outside auditors) may change or even 
reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these 
standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and 
reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may 
be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could 
materially affect how we report our financial results and 
condition. We may be required to apply a new or revised standard 
retroactively or apply an existing standard differently, also 
retroactively, in each case potentially resulting in our restating 
prior period financial statements in material amounts. 

For more information, refer to the “Current Accounting 

Developments” section in this Report. 

Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and 
estimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in 
the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal 
controls over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are 
required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing 
our financial statements, including in determining credit loss 
reserves, reserves for mortgage repurchases, reserves related to 
litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among 
other items. Several of our accounting policies are critical 
because they require management to make difficult, subjective 
and complex judgments about matters that are inherently 
uncertain and because it is likely that materially different 
amounts would be reported under different conditions or using 
different assumptions. For a description of these policies, refer to 
the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. If 
assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements 
are incorrect, we may experience material losses. 

Certain of our financial instruments, including derivative 
assets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private 
equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and 
resale agreements, among other items, require a determination 
of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. 
Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair 
value determinations based on internally developed models or 
other means which ultimately rely to some degree on 
management judgment, and there is no assurance that our 
models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs 
required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and 
other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price 
levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based 
on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden 
illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and 
securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance 
sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such 
valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and 
could lead to declines in our earnings.
