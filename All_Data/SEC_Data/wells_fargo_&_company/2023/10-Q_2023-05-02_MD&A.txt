In first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to 
the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. We adopted ASU 2018-12 with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and 
certain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, including the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the 
Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 
Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and interest-earning deposits with banks. 
Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding. 
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible 
common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common 
equity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding 
reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
For additional information, see the “Capital Management” section and Note 21 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report.

(10)  Represents TLAC divided by RWAs, which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
(11)  Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule.

This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). 

When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries 
(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used 
throughout this Report. 

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one 
in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses 
in the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the 
U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and 
mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance, through our four reportable operating 
segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, 
Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment 
Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 41 on Fortune’s 2022 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at March 31, 2023. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control 

infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The 
Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience 
issues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. 
We are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we 
implement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result 
in additional regulatory actions. Issues or delays with one 
regulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure 
to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely 
basis could result in additional penalties, business restrictions, 
enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which 
could be significant. While we still have significant work to do and 
have not yet satisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, 
the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary 
to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain 
the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in 
place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 

acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second 
third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy 
and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the 
OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the 
Company related to insufficient progress in addressing 
requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss 
mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. 
On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to 
clarify how it would terminate. 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent

execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party 
residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile 
Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage 
Lending 
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer 
remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, 
consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain 
practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive 
refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile 
protection agreements; comply with certain business practice 
requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a 
$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related 
to many of these matters were already substantially complete at 
the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent 
order lays out a path to termination after the Company 
completes the remainder of the required actions. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB 
consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk 
Factors” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify 
areas or instances where customers may have experienced 
financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and 
implement additional operational and control procedures. We are 
working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. 

We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs 
related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts 
may change based on additional facts and information, as well as 
ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our 
ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our 
risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the 
future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To 
the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any 
customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have 
previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. 

For additional information regarding these activities, 
including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Recent Developments 
LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely 
referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at 

which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. 
On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 
Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator 
of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no 
longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 
2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR 
settings would no longer be published on a representative basis 
after June 30, 2023. 

In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) 
Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide 
a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate 
based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in U.S. 
law contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have 
fallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on 
LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act 
on December 16, 2022, which became effective on February 27, 
2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our 
legacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate 
fallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement 
rates specified in the FRB’s final rule. 

In preparation for the cessation of USD LIBOR on a 
representative basis, we no longer offer new contracts 
referencing LIBOR, subject to limited exceptions based on 
regulatory guidance. We also continue to execute our LIBOR 
transition activities to enhance our operational readiness. 

For certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities 
and related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with 
our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR-
based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the 
June 30, 2023 transition date. 

Following June 30, 2023, we expect substantially all of our 

consumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, 
derivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to 
transition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in 
accordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. 

For additional information regarding the risks and potential 

impact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being 
significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the “Risk 
Factors” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Financial Performance 
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 
In first quarter 2023, we adopted FASB ASU 2018-12 – Financial 
Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the 
Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. The most significant 
impact of adoption related to reinsurance of variable annuity 
products for a limited number of our insurance clients. These 
variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits 
that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of 
the policyholder’s life once the policyholder's account values are 
exhausted. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into 
new contracts. The ASU requires these guaranteed minimum 
benefits (referred to as market risk benefits) to be measured at 
fair value through earnings (recognized in other noninterest 
income), except for changes in fair value attributable to our own 
credit risk, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. 

We adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which 

required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior 
period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related 
metrics were not revised. For additional information, including 
the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of 
ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

In first quarter 2023, we generated $5.0 billion of net income and 
diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.23, compared 
with $3.8 billion of net income and diluted EPS of $0.91 in the 
same period a year ago. Financial performance for first quarter 
2023, compared with the same period a year ago, included the 
following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net interest income 
and higher net gains from trading activities, partially offset 
by lower net gains from equity securities and lower 
mortgage banking income; 
provision for credit losses reflected increases for commercial 
real estate loans, primarily office loans, as well as for credit 
card and auto loans; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses, partially offset by higher personnel expense; 
average loans increased driven by loan growth across both 
our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
average deposits decreased driven by reductions in all 
operating segments, partially offset by growth in Corporate.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in first quarter 2023. 
Total equity of $183.2 billion at March 31, 2023, increased 
compared with $182.2 billion at December 31, 2022. Our 
liquidity and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at 
March 31, 2023, including: 
• 

our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.81% under 
the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 
9.20%; 
our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of 
total risk-weighted assets was 23.34%, compared with the 
regulatory minimum of 21.50%; and 
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 122%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%. 

• 

• 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the following: 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$13.7 billion at March 31, 2023, increased $96 million from 
December 31, 2022. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $1.1 billion in 

• 

• 

• 

first quarter 2023, compared with $(775) million in the same 
period a year ago. The ACL for loans and the provision for 
credit losses for loans reflected increases for commercial 
real estate loans, primarily office loans, as well as for credit 
card and auto loans. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.45% at 
March 31, 2023, compared with 1.42% at December 31, 
2022. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $63 million, 
or 5 basis points of average commercial loans, in first quarter 
2023, compared with net loan charge-offs of $(29) million, 
or (2) basis points, in the same period a year ago, driven by 
higher losses across all commercial portfolios, primarily in 
our commercial and industrial portfolio. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $541 million, 
or 56 basis points of average consumer loans, in first quarter 
2023, compared with net loan charge-offs of $334 million, 
or 35 basis points, in the same period a year ago, driven by 
higher losses in all consumer portfolios, primarily in our 
credit card portfolio. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $6.1 billion at March 31, 
2023, increased $379 million, or 7%, from December 31, 
2022, driven by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual 
loans, partially offset by lower residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans. NPAs represented 0.65% of total loans at 
March 31, 2023.

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for first quarter 2023 was $5.0 billion 
($1.23 diluted EPS), compared with $3.8 billion ($0.91 diluted 
EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income increased in first 
quarter 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, 
predominantly due to a $4.1 billion increase in net interest 
income, partially offset by a $2.0 billion increase in provision for 
credit losses and a $1.1 billion decrease in noninterest income. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and net interest margin increased in first 
quarter 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, due to 
the impact of higher interest rates on earning assets, higher loan 
balances, and lower mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium 
amortization, partially offset by higher expenses for interest 
bearing deposits and long-term debt. 

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended March 31, 2023 
and 2022. 

For additional information about net interest income and 

net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net 
Interest Income” section in our 2022 Form 10-K.

the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and our efforts 
to help customers avoid overdraft fees; and 
lower fees on commercial accounts driven by a higher 
earnings credit rate due to an increase in interest rates.

In first quarter 2023, we executed letters of intent to sell 
MSRs on approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others 
that we expect to close later this year. These expected sales have 
been considered in the valuation of our MSRs. 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 6 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting lower average market valuations. 

Net gains from trading activities increased driven by higher 
trading results across all asset classes. 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” section in this Report. 

Commissions and brokerage services fees increased due to 
higher service fee rates. 

Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market 
activity. 

Net servicing income decreased driven by: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of mortgage 
loans serviced for others; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower amortization of the fair value mortgage servicing right 
(MSR) due to lower prepayment rates driven by increases in 
interest rates. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
unrealized losses on nonmarketable equity securities driven 
• 
by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; and 
lower realized gains on the sales of equity securities driven 
by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses. 

• 

Other income decreased driven by the change in fair value of 
liabilities associated with our reinsurance business, which was 
recognized as a result of our adoption of ASU 2018-12. For 
additional information on our adoption of ASU 2018-12, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
• 

lower residential mortgage origination volume driven by our 
exit from the correspondent business in first quarter 2023; 
and 
lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from Government National Mortgage Association 
(GNMA) loan securitization pools.

Personnel expense increased driven by: 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 
• 

lower incentive compensation expense; and 
the impact of efficiency initiatives. 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for the amortization of 
internally developed software. 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
customer remediation and litigation matters. 

As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, 
regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact 
operating losses in the coming quarters.

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Advertising and promotion expense increased due to higher 
marketing and brand campaign volumes. 

Other expense increased due to higher Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit assessment expense driven 
by a higher assessment rate. 

We expect our FDIC deposit assessment expense will further 

increase as a result of the FDIC's announcement to recover by 
special assessment losses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a 
result of recent bank failures.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 5. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed 
with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior 
management. The management reporting process is based on 
U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds 
transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue 
and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt 
sources, which allows management to assess performance 
consistently across the operating segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

Table 5:  Management Reporting Structure 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Effective January 1, 2023, 
management modified its capital allocation methodology to 
improve alignment of allocated capital with the binding 
regulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes 
that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure 
because it enables management, investors, and others to assess 
a reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Excludes nonaccrual loans. 

First quarter 2023 vs. first quarter 2022 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads, partially offset by lower deposit 
balances; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
origination volumes and lower revenue related to the 
resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA loan 
securitization pools; and 
lower deposit-related fees reflecting the elimination of non-
sufficient funds fees and our efforts to help customers avoid 
overdraft fees. 

• 

Provision for credit losses included a $843 million increase in the 
allowance for credit losses reflecting a less favorable economic 
outlook and portfolio credit normalization, as well as higher net 
charge-offs. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses reflecting lower expense for 
customer remediation and litigation matters; and 
lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related 
incentive compensation in Home Lending due to lower 
production, and the impact of efficiency initiatives; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher operating costs.

First quarter 2023 vs. first quarter 2022 

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth. 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads as well as higher loan balances; 

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs 
and personnel expense, partially offset by the impact of 
efficiency initiatives. 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower deposit-related fees driven by the impact of higher 
earnings credit rates, which result in lower fees for 
commercial customers; and 
lower other noninterest income driven by lower net gains 
from equity securities.

• 

lower deposit-related fees driven by the impact of higher 
earnings credit rates, which result in lower fees for corporate 
banking customers. 

Provision for credit losses included a $400 million increase in the 
allowance for credit losses reflecting an increase for commercial 
real estate loans, primarily office loans. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs 
and personnel expense, partially offset by the impact of 
efficiency initiatives.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

Table 6h:  WIM Advisory Assets 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 6h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes 
that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows 
management, investors, and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

For both first quarter 2023 and 2022, the average fee rate 

by account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 

First quarter 2023 vs. first quarter 2022 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

net losses on nonmarketable equity securities from our 
affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates. 

Provision for credit losses reflected an increase in allowance for 
credit losses. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by the impact of 
divestitures. 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets, net of accumulated 
depreciation, of $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion as of March 31, 2023, 
and December 31, 2022, respectively. The average age of our rail 
cars is 22 years and the rail cars are typically leased to customers 
under short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our four largest 
concentrations, which represented 67% of our rail car fleet as of 
March 31, 2023, were rail cars used for the transportation of 
cement/sand, agricultural grain, plastics, and coal products. We 
may incur impairment charges in the future based on changing 
economic and market conditions affecting the long-term 
demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions 
for impairment are sensitive to estimated utilization and rental 
rates as well as the estimated economic life of the leased asset. 
For additional information on the accounting for impairment of 
operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 8 (Leasing Activity) to Financial 
Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.

In first quarter 2023, we reclassified HTM debt securities with a fair value of $23.2 billion to AFS debt securities in connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-01 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 
815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

First quarter 2023 vs. first quarter 2022 

Total assets (average and period-end) decreased reflecting: 
• 

a decrease in cash and due from banks, and interest-earning 
deposits with banks that are managed by corporate treasury 
as a result of a decrease in deposits in the operating 
segments and an increase in loans originated in the 
operating segments; and 
lower available-for-sale debt securities due to sales and net 
unrealized losses, partially offset by the reclassification of 
HTM debt securities to AFS debt securities in connection 
with the adoption of ASU 2022-01. 

• 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
issuances of certificates of deposit (CDs).

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $6 million related to available-for-sale debt securities at both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and 
$77 million and $85 million related to held-to-maturity debt securities at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 7 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments 

The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt 

securities at March 31, 2023, were driven by higher interest rates 
and changes in credit spreads. 

At March 31, 2023, 99% of the combined AFS and HTM debt 
securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on 
external ratings where available and, where not available, based 
on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and 
Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information on AFS and HTM debt 
securities, including a summary of debt securities by security 
type. 

in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2022 
Form 10-K for information on our investment management 
objectives and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management” section in this Report for information on 
liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities increased from December 31, 
2022. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities exceeded 
portfolio runoff. 

In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities with a fair 
value of $3.7 billion to HTM debt securities in first quarter 2023 
due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital 
management purposes. Debt securities transferred from AFS to 
HTM in first quarter 2023 had $320 million of pre-tax unrealized 
losses at the time of the transfers. 

Additionally, in first quarter 2023, we also reclassified HTM 
debt securities with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and 
amortized cost of $23.9 billion to AFS debt securities in 
connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and 
Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method. 
For additional information on our adoption of ASU 2022-01, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 8 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans decreased from 
December 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the 
commercial and industrial loan portfolio as a result of paydowns, 

partially offset by seasonally higher loan draws and new 
originations within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. 
Consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2022, a 
significant portion of which was due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in the residential mortgage portfolio.

partially offset by: 
• 

higher time deposits driven by issuances of certificates of 
deposit (CDs). 

Table 9 provides additional information regarding deposit 
balances. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net 
interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is 
provided in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” 
section and Table 1 earlier in this Report. In response to higher 
interest rates, our average deposit cost in first quarter 2023 
increased to 0.83%, compared with 0.46% in fourth quarter 2022. 

Deposits 
Deposits decreased from December 31, 2022, reflecting:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. 
These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs 
of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, 
and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring 
activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to 
individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity 
structure of these commitments. For additional information, see 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 13 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 14 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

For additional information about how we manage risk, see 

the “Risk Management” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. The 
discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the 
management of certain risks contained in the “Risk 
Management” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of the Company’s assets and exposures such as debt security 
holdings, certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, 
which is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the 
Chief Risk Officer and supports periodic reports related to credit 
risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit 
Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio  Our loan portfolios represent the largest 
component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which 
we have credit risk. Table 10 presents our total loans outstanding 
by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into its credit risk management activities. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews Our credit risk monitoring 
process is designed to enable early identification of developing 
risk and to support our determination of an appropriate 
allowance for credit losses. The following discussion provides 
additional characteristics and analysis of our significant 
portfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis 
and credit metric information for each of the following 
portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories.

We had $13.3 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at March 31, 2023, 
compared with $12.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase 
was driven by the technology, telecom and media, and 
entertainment and recreation industries. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 

Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio decreased at March 31, 2023, compared with 
December 31, 2022, as a result of paydowns, partially offset by 
seasonally higher loan draws and new originations. Table 12 
provides our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 
by industry. The industry categories are based on the North 
American Industry Classification System.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Table 12a provides further loan segmentation for our largest 
industry category, financials except banks. This category includes 
loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, 
rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment 
banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to 

help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, 
collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of 
collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a 
percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering 
underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  Our CRE loan portfolio is 
comprised of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The 
total CRE loan portfolio decreased $1.1 billion from 
December 31, 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in loans for 
mixed use properties and office property types, partially offset 
by an increase in loans for the apartments property type. The 
portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. 
The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in 
California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which represented a 
combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property 
type concentrations are apartments at 26% and office at 23% of 
the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments were $9.2 billion 
and $8.8 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, 
respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and $18.9 billion and $20.7 
billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans. 

We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment 
using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had 

Table 13:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

$13.2 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at 
March 31, 2023, compared with $11.3 billion at December 31, 
2022, and $1.3 billion of CRE construction loans classified as 
criticized at March 31, 2023, compared with $1.1 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The increase in criticized CRE loans was 
predominantly driven by the office property type. The credit 
quality of the office property type continued to be adversely 
affected as weakened demand for office space continued to drive 
higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. 
At March 31, 2023, nearly one-third of the CRE loans in the 
office property type had recourse to a guarantor, typically 
through a repayment guarantee, in addition to the related 
collateral. Loans in California and New York represented 
approximately 40% of the office property type at March 31, 
2023.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At March 31, 2023, non-U.S. loans totaled $84.4 billion, 
representing approximately 9% of our total consolidated loans 
outstanding, compared with $87.5 billion, or approximately 9% of 
our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2022. 
Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% and 5% of our total 
consolidated assets at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, 
respectively. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of a borrower’s ability to repay, 
which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on a borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

March 31, 2023, was the United Kingdom, which totaled

$30.5 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $4.6 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch. 

Table 14 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 14: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments (excluding discretionary 
amounts where our approval or consent is required prior to 
any loan funding or commitment increase), and deposits 
with non-U.S. banks. These balances are presented prior to 
the deduction of allowance for credit losses or collateral 
received under the terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $47.2 billion exposure to financial institutions and $47.6 billion to non-financial corporations at March 31, 2023. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1–4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 95% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at both March 31, 
2023, and December 31, 2022. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with 

adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a 
result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that 
limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. 
The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. 

ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for 
the majority of this portfolio at March 31, 2023. We do not offer 
option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage 
products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to 
within the financial services industry as negative amortizing 
mortgage loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. 
These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only

payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar 
features. The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines 
of credit was $17.2 billion at March 31, 2023, compared with 
$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded credit 
commitments for these lines of credit totaled $33.9 billion at 
March 31, 2023, compared with $35.5 billion at December 31, 
2022. For additional information on our residential loan portfolio, 
see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 
We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. For additional information 
about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2022 
Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 

current Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan/ 

Table 15:  Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio Performance 

combined loan to collateral values (LTV/CLTV) on the entire 
residential mortgage loan portfolio. CLTV represents the ratio of 
the total loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including 
unused line amounts for credit line products) to property 
collateral value. For additional information regarding credit 
quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For additional information on loan modifications, see

Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section 
in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $1.3 billion from 
December 31, 2022, due to loan paydowns, partially offset by 
originations.

seasonally lower purchase volume. 

Auto  The decrease in the outstanding balance at March 31,

origination volumes reflecting credit tightening actions and 
continued price competition due to rising interest rates. 

Other Consumer  The decrease in the outstanding balance at

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans increased $452 million from 

December 31, 2022, driven by an increase in commercial real 
estate nonaccrual loans, predominantly within the office 
property type. For additional information on commercial 
nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 
Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $68 million from 

December 31, 2022, due to lower residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Table 19 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in 
developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to 
losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors 
at March 31, 2023: 
• 

97% of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured, the 
majority of which are secured by real estate. 
86% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 78% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  In January 2023, we 
adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting and 
reporting guidance for TDRs. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

At December 31, 2022, TDRs totaled $9.2 billion. The 
amount of our TDRs for COVID-related loan modification 
programs would have otherwise been higher without the TDR 
relief provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic 
Security Act (CARES Act) and the Interagency Statement on Loan 
Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with 

Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (Interagency 
Statement). Customers who are unable to resume making their 
contractual loan payments upon exiting from these programs 
may require further assistance and may receive or be eligible to 
receive modifications. For additional information on customer 
accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 
Form 10-K.

The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into 

quarter 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
driven by higher losses across all commercial portfolios, primarily 
in our commercial and industrial portfolio. 

The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in first 
quarter 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
driven by higher losses in all consumer portfolios, primarily in our 
credit card portfolio. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, including deposits with banks, net 
investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit 
exposures. 

consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted 
loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-
specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and 
complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit 
metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do 
not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use 
several analytical tools. For additional information on our ACL, 
see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit 
Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. For 
additional information on our ACL for loans, see Note 5 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report, and for additional information on our ACL for debt 
securities, see Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 22 presents the allocation of the ACL for loans by loan 

portfolio segment and class.

Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 22 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans increased $96 million, or 1%, from 
December 31, 2022, reflecting increases for commercial real 
estate loans, primarily office loans, as well as for credit card and 
auto loans, partially offset by a decrease for residential mortgage 
loans related to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial 
Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt 
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. For additional information 
on ASU 2022-02, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. The 
detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment 
(including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is included in 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base 
scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario 
and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans 
at March 31, 2023. The base scenario assumed elevated inflation 
and economic contraction in the near term, reflecting increased 
unemployment rates from historically low levels and declining 
property values. The downside scenarios assumed a more 
substantial economic contraction due to high inflation, declining 
property values, and lower business and consumer confidence. 
Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent 

the risk of limitations inherent in our processes and assumptions 
such as economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions 
and performance, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments.

We believe the ACL for loans of $13.7 billion at March 31, 
2023, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including 
unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance 
is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. 
The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing 
factors as of the date of determination, including economic or 
market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination 
processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes 
in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we 
will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the 
balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is 
discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for 
Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 
Form 10-K. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and 
commercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with 
our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we 
have established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information 
on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 
2022 Form 10-K. 

In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as 
servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial 
mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of 
FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label 
mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans 
owned by institutional investors. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 

payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of 
delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) 
to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer 
advances and servicing fees. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon 
transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans 
from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes 
exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid 
by the borrower. We may repurchase these loans for cash and as 
a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. 
Repurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise 
modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may 
be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. At 
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, these loans, which we 
have repurchased or have the option to repurchase, were 
$9.3 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively, which included 
$8.3 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, in loans held for 
investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. See 
Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 2022 
Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage banking 
activities, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For 
information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2022 
Form 10-K.

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market 
fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange 
can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming 
from mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows 
primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending 
and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
• 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, 
mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate 
than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans 
and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as 
all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar 
interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the 
simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24: 
Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
• 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the 
alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher 
yielding products could impact expected net interest 
income. 
The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the 
historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the 
expectations of deposit products repricing as market 
interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our 
actual experience in base and alternative scenarios may 
differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of 
deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other 
factors.

•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from 

December 31, 2022, to March 31, 2023, in Table 24 reflected 
updates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance 
sheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate 
sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher 
interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater 
degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest 
rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree 
than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. 

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage 
banking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in 
the opposite direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking 
Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in our 2022 Form 10-K 
for additional information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted 
by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits 
that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees 
on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of 
related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In 
addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and 
noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by 
the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional 
information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in 

the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect 
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers 
the amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes 
unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt 
securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized 
into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact 
from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in the following 
main ways: 
• 

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including certain interest-earning 
deposits, commercial loans and long-term debt, from 
floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice 
versa; 
to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities 
portfolio; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 
Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures 
are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in 
this Report.

• 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity 
risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and 
other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or 
securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage 
loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of 
commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for 
investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability 
management activities. We may also retain securities in our 
investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. 

Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking 
noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and 
the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan 
commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage 
applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our 
mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to 
the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer 
demand, as well as the time required for processing a new 
application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and 
selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend 
on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest 
rates. For additional information on mortgage banking, including 
key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – 
Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section and 
Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 11 (Derivatives), and 
Note 12 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the 
trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans held at fair 
value, and impairment of private equity investments. For 
information on our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk

Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk” 
section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser 
extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held 
for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 

Table 25:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For additional information on our 
monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market 
Risk – Trading Activities” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 25 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 
category. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR 
for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was primarily driven by changes in portfolio 
composition.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 
2022 Form 10-K. 

We also have marketable equity securities that include 

investments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair 
value changes in these marketable equity securities are 
recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 4 
(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  Liquidity risk is the risk arising from 
the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they 
come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without 

incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we 
enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash 
payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of 
deposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-
operational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet our contractual 
obligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both 
normal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-
specific and/or market stress. 

To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity 

guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover 
potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence 
on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are 
monitored on a monthly basis by the management-level 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by 
the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for 
both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that 
the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. For 
additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, 
see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold 
high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists 
of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and 
mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies 
to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) 
with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued 
by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as 
Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 

Table 26:  Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies 
to the Company and to our IDIs with total assets of $10 billion or 
more. As of March 31, 2023, we were compliant with the NSFR 
requirement. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of March 31, 2023, the Company, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank West 
exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100%. 
Table 26 presents the Company’s quarterly average values for 
the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant 
to the LCR rule requirements. The LCR represents average HQLA 
divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is 
defined under the LCR rule.

Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and 
unfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors, including the type of customer and the nature of the account. 

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, 
interest-earning deposits with banks, and unencumbered high-
quality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary 
sources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are 
substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR 
rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 
exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. Our primary sources 

of liquidity are presented in Table 27 at fair value, which also 
includes encumbered securities that are not included as available 
HQLA in the calculation of the LCR. 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. We believe the debt securities included in Table 27 
provide quick and reliable sources of liquidity through sales or by 
pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions. 
Debt securities within our HTM portfolio are not intended for 
sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 27, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities, including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization, or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. 

Funding Sources  The Parent acts as a source of funding for the 
Company through the issuance of long-term debt and equity. 
WFC Holdings, LLC (the “IHC”) is an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent, which provides funding 

support for the ongoing operational requirements of the Parent 
and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For additional 
information on the IHC, see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living 
Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in our 2022 
Form 10-K. Additional subsidiary funding is provided by deposits, 
short-term borrowings and long-term debt. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 144% and 145% of total 
loans at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 
As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately $219.1 billion 

of available borrowing capacity at various Federal Home Loan

Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Although 
available, we do not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Reserve Discount Window as a primary source of liquidity. 

Table 28 presents a summary of our short-term borrowings, 

which generally mature in less than 30 days. For additional 
information on the classification of our short-term borrowings, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 

Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K. We pledge certain 
financial instruments that we own to collateralize repurchase 
agreements and other securities financings. For additional 
information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of Note 15 
(Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this

We access domestic and international capital markets for 

long-term funding through issuances of registered debt 
securities, private placements and asset-backed secured funding. 
We issue long-term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies 
to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate 
maturity profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for 
general corporate purposes unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, and we expect 
the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for 

Table 29:  Maturity of Long-Term Debt 

the same purposes. Depending on market conditions and our 
liquidity position, we may redeem or repurchase, and 
subsequently retire, our outstanding debt securities in privately 
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, or 
otherwise. Table 29 provides the aggregate carrying value of 
long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) 
for the remainder of 2023 and the following years thereafter, as 
of March 31, 2023.

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies 

with regard to our credit ratings during first quarter 2023.

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at March 31, 
2023, increased $3.7 billion from December 31, 2022, 
predominantly as a result of $5.0 billion of Wells Fargo net 
income, partially offset by $1.4 billion of common and preferred 
stock dividends. During first quarter 2023, we issued 
$676 million of common stock, substantially all of which was 
issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. 
In first quarter 2023, we repurchased 86 million shares of 
common stock at a cost of $4.0 billion. In first quarter 2023, our 
AOCI increased $789 million, predominantly due to a decrease in 
net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities and derivative and 
hedging activities. For additional information about capital 
planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section 
below. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, 
and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both 
approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 31 and 
Table 32 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable 
to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced 
Approach, respectively, as of March 31, 2023.

Capital conservation buffer

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 31 and Table 32, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at March 31, 
2023, was 0.00%. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress.

Capital Management (continued) 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is 
3.20%. 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also 

subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital 
surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually 
calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher 
of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers 
our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 

Table 33:  Capital Components and Ratios 

wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If 
our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our 
annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our 
G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Table 33 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, total 
capital, RWAs and capital ratios.

In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12. We adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and 
certain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period-end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of the current expected credit loss accounting 
standard (CECL) on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two 
and 75% in year three. 
Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of 
qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 
1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs. 

Table 35 provides the composition of our RWAs under the 

Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. For additional information, see Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period-end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule permits 
certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each 
period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two and 75% in year three. 
Includes $338 million related to our first quarter 2023 adoption of ASU 2018-12. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in 
consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred 
taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, 
which represents tangible common equity divided by common 
shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of 
determining tangible common equity may differ among 
companies. Management believes that tangible book value per 
common share and return on average tangible common equity, 
which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial 
measures because they enable management, investors, and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 38 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period-end. 

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 39 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
March 31, 2023. 

Table 39:  Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum Tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 
rules. For information regarding the proposed amendments to 
the SLR rules, see the “Capital Management – Leverage 
Requirements” section in our 2022 Form 10-K.

Capital Management (continued) 

At March 31, 2023, the Company’s SLR was 6.96%, and each 
of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements. Table 40 
presents information regarding the calculation and components 
of the Company’s SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratio.

Adjustment represents derivatives and collateral netting exposures as defined for 
supplementary leverage ratio determination purposes. 
Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
March 31, 2023, are presented in Table 41.

Approaches. 

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo 

Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are 
subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital 
requirements. As of March 31, 2023, these broker-dealer 
subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory 
minimum net capital requirements. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the 
stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory 
requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, 
changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our 
long-term target capital levels are set above their respective 
regulatory minimums plus buffers. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. We submitted our 2023 
capital plan to the FRB prior to the April 5, 2023, deadline. 

As part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB 
reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all 
large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital 
actions. The FRB has indicated it will publish its supervisory 
stress test results by June 30, 2023. 

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the 
institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 

amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At March 31, 2023, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 164 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during first quarter 2023, see Part II, Item 2 in 
this Report. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. For a 
discussion of other significant regulations and regulatory 
oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our 
business, see the “Regulatory Matters” and “Risk Factors” 
sections in our 2022 Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2022 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. For additional information on these policies, see the 
“Critical Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2022 Form 10-K and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 43 provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 43:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description and Effective Date 

Financial statement impact 
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-02 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method 
The Update, effective January 1, 2024 
(with early adoption permitted), permits 
entities to elect to account for additional 
tax credit investments using the 
proportional amortization method. The 
Update requires a separate accounting 
policy election for each tax credit 
program. For any tax credit program 
where the proportional amortization 
method is elected, all investments within 
that program that meet eligibility 
criteria are required to apply the 
proportional amortization method. The 
Update also requires additional 
disclosures for any tax credit program 
where the proportional amortization 
method is elected. 

The Update eliminates the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)-only scope limitation of the 
proportional amortization method and permits entities to account for all tax credit investments made 
primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and income tax benefits using a consistent 
accounting method. Under the proportional amortization method, tax credit investments are carried at 
amortized cost and amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and income tax benefits received. 
The amortization of the investment and the related income tax credits and income tax benefits are 
recorded in income tax expense. The Update may be adopted on either a full retrospective or modified 
retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. 

Upon adoption of the Update, we will disaggregate our tax credit investment portfolio into tax credit 
programs and make a separate accounting policy election as to whether to apply the proportional 
amortization method for each program. For any investments that will apply the proportional 
amortization method upon adoption of the Update, the cumulative effect of the difference between the 
current carrying value and the carrying value under the proportional amortization method will be 
recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, the period of which is dependent 
upon which transition method is selected. 

We are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on our consolidated financial statements. 

Other Accounting Developments 
The following Update is applicable to us but is not expected to 
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters (including the conflict in 
Ukraine), and any slowdown in global economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards or our 
strategic plans for the business; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company, 
and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company, we refer you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2022 
Form 10-K.

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of March 31, 2023, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. 
The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s 
chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of 
March 31, 2023. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the 
Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
and includes those policies and procedures that: 
• 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

• 

• 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during first quarter 
2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Financial Statements 

-See the “Glossary of Acronyms“ at the end of this Report for terms used throughout the Financial Statements and related Notes. 

Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services 
company. We provide banking, investment and mortgage 
products and services, as well as consumer and commercial 
finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and 
other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and 
institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in 
countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the 
Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company 
and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the 
Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding 
company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate 
investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock 
outstanding. 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in 
the financial services industry. For discussion of our significant 
accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were 
no material changes to these policies in first quarter 2023. 
To prepare the financial statements in conformity with 

GAAP, management must make estimates based on 
assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for 
example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the 
reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our 
estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect 
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual 
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, 
which could materially affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. Management has made significant estimates 
in several areas, including: 
• 

allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses)); 
valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) 
(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 13 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); 
valuations of financial instruments (Note 12 (Fair Values of 
Assets and Liabilities)); 
liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 10 (Legal 
Actions)); 
income taxes; and 
goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other 
Assets)). 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 

Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all 
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary 
for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. 
These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless 
otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations 
in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the 
results that may be expected for the full year. The interim 
financial information should be read in conjunction with our 2022 
Form 10-K. 

• 

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 
In 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance:

ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for 
troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces 
new required disclosures for loan modifications made to 
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required 
disclosures include information about modifications granted to 
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal 
forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant 
payment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these 
modifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the 
financial effects of these modifications and for loan performance 
in the twelve months following the modification. The Update also 
amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure 
of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for 
additional information related to the new disclosures for loan 
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and 
for gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided 
on a prospective basis. 

The Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted 

cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit 
losses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current 
expected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current 
expected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications 
and the subsequent performance of modified loans, including 
defaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate 
expected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, 
2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure 
credit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial 
loans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest 
concession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to 
apply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, 
resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
upon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-
modification and post-modification effective interest rates that 
would have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans 
as interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in 
our ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained 
earnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF 
approach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent 
commercial loans. 

ASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which 
expands an entity's ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting 
for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial 
assets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for 
hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method.

Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

We adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023 on a 
prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the 
opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon 
adoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The 
portfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to 
hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of 
financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt 
securities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger 
proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type 
of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by 
increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both 
prepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value 
hedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the 
carrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments 
related to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at 
a portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the 
portfolio. 

Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer 
method hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update 
permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-
to-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities 
are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 
days after the adoption date. 

In January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities 
with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost 
of $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate 
swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges 
using the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities 
was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately $566 
million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt securities 
being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of deferred 
taxes. 

See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt 

Securities) for additional information about the Company's 
portfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS 
transfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 11 
(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method 
hedging relationships. 

ASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 
805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and 
measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business 
combination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. 
Prior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to 
recognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such 
items at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update 
prospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a 
material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration 
insurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to 
the policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. 
These features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, 
protect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets 
risk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU 
requires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value 
through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our 
own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We 
reinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of 
insurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are 
accounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our 
reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. 

We utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market 

risk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities 
because they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. 
The fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes 
in fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder 
behavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in 
mortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use 
derivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge 
the interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of 
market risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is 
recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We 
recognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, 
excluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in 
noninterest income along with the changes in fair value of 
economic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own 
credit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon 
adoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we 
implemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits 
retrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted 
in an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained 
earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by 
$176 million and $44 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2022. 
The ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance 
assumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate 
for traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the 
amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting 
changes for the liability of future policyholder benefits for 
traditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses 
and other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in 
other assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. 

Table 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period 
financial statement line items within our consolidated statement 
of income and consolidated balance sheet for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2022. These 
adjustments are also reflected in our consolidated statement of 
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows.

Note 3:  Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 

Table 3.1 provides the amortized cost, net of the allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for debt securities, and fair value by major 
categories of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, which are 
carried at fair value, and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, 
which are carried at amortized cost, net of the ACL. The net 
unrealized gains (losses) for AFS debt securities are reported as a 
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), 
net of the ACL and applicable income taxes. Information on debt 
securities held for trading is included in Note 2 (Trading 
Activities). 

Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on 
AFS and HTM debt securities, which are included in other assets. 
See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for additional 
information on accrued interest receivable. Amounts considered 
to be uncollectible are reversed through interest income. The 
interest income reversed in first quarter 2023 and 2022 was 
insignificant.

Table 3.2 details the breakout of purchases of and transfers 
to HTM debt securities by major category of security. The table 
excludes the transfer of HTM debt securities with a fair value of 
$23.2 billion to AFS debt securities in first quarter 2023 in 

connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and 
Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method.

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality of debt securities by evaluating various 
attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the 
appropriateness of the ACL for debt securities. The credit quality 
indicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings 
and delinquency status and are based on information as of our 
financial statement date. 

CREDIT RATINGS  Credit ratings express opinions about the credit 
quality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a 
security according to the lowest credit rating made available by 
national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). 
Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings 
similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are 
generally considered by the rating agencies and market 

participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities 
rated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by 
the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher 
credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt 
securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit 
grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management 
purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major 
credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated 
by NRSROs at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 

Table 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt 
securities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined 
to be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based 
on internal credit grades.

DELINQUENCY STATUS AND NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES  Debt 
security issuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due 
under contractual debt agreements have a higher probability of 
recognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring of 
the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we consider 
whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of 
principal or interest payments and whether any securities have 
been placed into nonaccrual status. 

Debt securities that are past due and still accruing or in 
nonaccrual status were insignificant at both March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022. Net charge-offs on debt securities were 
insignificant in the first quarter of both 2023 and 2022. 

Purchased debt securities with credit deterioration (PCD) 
are not considered to be in nonaccrual status, as payments from 
issuers of these securities remain current. PCD securities were 
insignificant in the first quarter of both 2023 and 2022.

Note 3:  Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities (continued) 

Unrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
Table 3.5 shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of AFS 
debt securities by length of time those individual securities in 
each category have been in a continuous loss position. Debt 
securities on which we have recorded credit impairment are 

categorized as being “less than 12 months” or “12 months or 
more” in a continuous loss position based on the point in time 
that the fair value declined to below the amortized cost basis, net 
of allowance for credit losses.

We have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized 

For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing 

losses included in the previous table for credit impairment. As 
part of that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do 
not intend to sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more 
likely than not that we will not be required to sell, prior to 
recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where 
necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the 
present value of the expected cash flows to the debt securities’ 
amortized cost basis. Credit impairment is recorded as an ACL for 
debt securities.

Contractual Maturities 
Table 3.6 and Table 3.7 show the remaining contractual 
maturities, amortized cost, net of the ACL, fair value and 
weighted average effective yields of AFS and HTM debt 
securities, respectively. The remaining contractual principal 

maturities for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) do not 
consider prepayments. Remaining expected maturities will differ 
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the 
right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages 
mature.

Note 5:  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses 

Table 5.1 presents total loans outstanding by portfolio segment 
and class of financing receivable. Outstanding balances include 
unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and 
unamortized discounts and premiums. These amounts were less 
than 1% of our total loans outstanding at March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022. 

Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on 
loans, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. 

See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for additional 
information on accrued interest receivable. Amounts considered 
to be uncollectible are reversed through interest income. During 
first quarter 2023, we reversed accrued interest receivable of 
$9 million for our commercial portfolio segment and $55 million 
for our consumer portfolio segment, compared with $12 million 
and $32 million, respectively, for the same period a year ago.

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. Our commercial lending commitments include, but are 
not limited to, (i) commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, (ii) financing to customers who warehouse 
financial assets secured by real estate, consumer, or corporate 
loans, (iii) financing that is expected to be syndicated or replaced 
with other forms of long-term financing, and (iv) commercial real 
estate lending. We also originate multipurpose lending 
commitments under which commercial customers have the 
option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including 
the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the unfunded 
commitment amounts of the facility. 

The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. We may reduce or cancel 
lines of credit in accordance with the contracts and applicable 
law. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the 
amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in 
total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. 
We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are 
unconditionally cancellable at our discretion. 

We issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in 
purchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At 
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had $1.3 billion and 
$1.8 billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial 
letters of credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other 
Commitments) for additional information on issued standby 
letters of credit. 

We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a 

representative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide 
for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or 
letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in 
less than a week and would normally require default of both the 
customer and another lender to expose us to loss. 

The contractual amount of our unfunded credit 

commitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized 
in Table 5.4. The table excludes issued letters of credit and is 
presented net of commitments syndicated to others, including 
the fronting arrangements described above.

Includes lines of credit totaling $33.9 billion and $35.5 billion as of March 31, 2023, and

Allowance for Credit Losses 
Table 5.5 presents the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, 
which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance 
for unfunded credit commitments. The ACL for loans increased 
$96 million from December 31, 2022, reflecting increases for 

commercial real estate loans, primarily office loans, as well as for 
credit card and auto loans, partially offset by a decrease for 
residential mortgage loans related to the adoption of ASU 
2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): 
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.

Represents the change in our allowance for credit losses for loans as a result of our adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and 
Vintage Disclosures, on January 1, 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, loans with an allowance measured by discounting expected cash flows using the loan’s effective interest rate over the remaining life of the loan recognized

Represents the change in our allowance for credit losses for loans as a result of our adoption of ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and 
Vintage Disclosures, on January 1, 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, loans with an allowance measured by discounting expected cash flows using the loan’s effective interest rate over the remaining life of the loan recognized 
changes in allowance attributable to the passage of time as interest income. 

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and 
utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness 
of the ACL for loans. The following sections provide the credit 
quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit quality 
indicators are generally based on information as of our financial 
statement date. 

COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We manage a 
consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 
Commercial loans are generally subject to individual risk 
assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality 
ratings, which is our primary credit quality indicator. Our ratings 
are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized 
categories with the criticized segmented among special mention, 
substandard, doubtful and loss categories. 

Table 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our 
commercial loan portfolio by risk category and credit quality 
information by origination year for term loans. Revolving loans 
may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in 
the original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower 
experiencing financial difficulty. At March 31, 2023, we had 
$526.4 billion and $27.8 billion of pass and criticized commercial 
loans, respectively. Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in 
the following table for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which 
we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices; 
however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator 
for our loan portfolio.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We have various classes 
of consumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan 
delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-
to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary 
credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our 
evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer 
loan portfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class are 
included in the following tables for the quarter ended March 31, 
2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management 
practices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality 
indicator for our loan portfolio. 

Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for 
loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency 
is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of 
our ACL for consumer loans. Credit quality information is 
provided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving 
loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual 
provision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a 
borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 

We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores 

are generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited 
circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain 
loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due 
to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. 

Table 5.9 provides the outstanding balances of our 
residential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality 
indicators. 

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s outstanding 
balance to the property’s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) 
refers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien 
mortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line 
products) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade 
approach which first uses values provided by automated 
valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not 
available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised 
value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the 
property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised 
value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method 
considered for high value properties, generally with an original 
value of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less 
accurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs 
and CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV 
or CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios

LOANS IN PROCESS OF FORECLOSURE  Our recorded investment in 
consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate 
property that are in process of foreclosure was $1.0 billion at 
both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, which included 
$762 million and $771 million, respectively, of loans that are 
government insured/guaranteed. Under the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau guidelines, we do not commence the 
foreclosure process on residential mortgage loans until after the 
loan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure procedures and 
timelines vary depending on whether the property address 
resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. Judicial states require 
the foreclosure to be processed through the state’s courts while 
non-judicial states are processed without court intervention. 
Foreclosure timelines vary according to 
state law. 

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Certain 
loans 90 days or more past due are still accruing, because they 
are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) 
residential mortgage or consumer loans exempt under regulatory 
rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, 
usually 120 days past due. 

Table 5.14 shows loans 90 days or more past due and still 

accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL 
DIFFICULTY  We may agree to modify the contractual terms of a 
loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. 

Our commercial loan modifications may include principal 

forgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment delays, term 
extensions, or a combination of these modifications. Commercial 
loan term extensions have terms that vary based on the 
borrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an 
individual basis. 

Our consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan 
product and the modification program offered to the borrower, 
and may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term 
extensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a 
combination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer 
loan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve 
payment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as 
a result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and 
interest. 

Our residential mortgage loan modification programs may 
offer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower's 
demonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance 
is needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another 
loan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment 
period of three months to determine if the borrower can perform 
in accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification 
terms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance 
through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their 
original terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from 
our loan modification disclosures until the borrower has 
successfully completed the trial period and the loan modification 
is formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial 
payment period totaled $161 million at March 31, 2023. 

Table 5.15:  Commercial Loan Modifications 

Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the 

credit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or 
long-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program 
reduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term 
interest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the 
interest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification 
period, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked. 

Auto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., 

three months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. 

The following disclosures provide information on loan 
modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate 
reductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three 
months) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of 
these modifications, as well as the financial effects of these 
modifications, and loan performance in the twelve months 
following the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid 
off or charged-off during the period, resulting in an amortized 
cost balance of zero at the end of the period, are not included in 
the disclosures below. Additionally, where amortized cost 
balances are presented below, accrued interest receivable is 
excluded. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for 
additional information on accrued interest receivable. Borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty with modified terms mandated 
by a bankruptcy court are considered contractually modified 
loans and are included in these disclosures. These disclosures do 
not include loans discharged by a bankruptcy court as the only 
concession, which were insignificant for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2023. 

Table 5.15 presents the amortized cost of commercial loans 
that were modified during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, by

Note 5:  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

Commercial loans that received a modification during the 
quarter ended March 31, 2023, and subsequently defaulted were 
insignificant. Defaults that occur on commercial modifications 
are reported based on a payment default definition of 90 days 
past due. 

Table 5.15b provides past due information for commercial 

loans that were modified during the quarter ended March 31, 

2023. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral, 
payment performance is not included in the table below until the 
loan exits the deferral period and payments resume. The table 
also includes the amount of gross charge-offs that occurred 
during first quarter 2023 for loans that were modified in the 
quarter, inclusive of charge-offs to loans with no amortized cost 
remaining at period end.

Consumer loans that received a modification during the 
quarter ended March 31, 2023, and subsequently defaulted 
totaled $21 million, and predominantly related to payment delay 
modifications in the residential mortgage loan portfolio. Defaults 
that occur on consumer modifications are reported based on a 
payment default definition of 60 days past due. 

Table 5.16b provides past due information for consumer 
loans that were modified during the quarter ended March 31, 

Table 5.16b:  Payment Performance of Consumer Loan Modifications 

2023. For loan modifications that include a payment delay, 
payment performance is not included in the table below until the 
loan exits the deferral period and payments resume. The table 
also includes the amount of gross charge-offs that occurred 
during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, for loans that were 
modified in the quarter, inclusive of charge-offs to loans with no 
amortized cost remaining at period end.

Includes loans that were past due prior to entering a payment delay modification. Delinquency advancement is paused during the deferral period and resumes upon exit. 
Credit card loans that are past due at the time of the modification do not become current until they have three months of consecutive payment performance. 

Commitments to lend additional funds on commercial loans 

that were modified during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, 
were $30 million at March 31, 2023, substantially all of which 
were in the commercial and industrial portfolio. Commitments to 
lend additional funds on consumer loans that were modified 
during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, were insignificant at 
March 31, 2023. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  In January 2023, we 
adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting and 
reporting guidance for TDRs. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). The 
following disclosures present TDR information for the periods 
ended December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022. When, for 
economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial 
difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant 
period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of 
which totaled $9.2 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not 
consider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a 
TDR. In addition, COVID-19-related modifications are generally 
not classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and 
the Interagency Statement. For additional information on the 
TDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period 
of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned 
permanent modification, to determine if they can perform 
according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial 
modifications, which we classified and accounted for as TDRs 
through December 31, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU 
2022-02. While loans are in trial payment programs, their original 
terms are not considered modified and they continue to advance 
through delinquency status and accrue interest according to their 
original terms. 

Commitments to lend additional funds on loans whose 
terms have been modified in a TDR amounted to $434 million at 
December 31, 2022. 

Table 5.17 summarizes our TDR modifications by primary 

modification type and includes the financial effects of these 
modifications. For those loans that modify more than once, the 
table reflects each modification that occurred during the period. 
Loans that both modify and are paid off or written-off within the 
period, as well as changes in recorded investment during the 
period for loans modified in prior periods, are not included in the

Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of concessions, but are presented only once in the first 
modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of $118 million for first quarter 2022. 

(3) 

(2)  Other concessions include loans with payment (principal and/or interest) deferral, loans discharged in bankruptcy, loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but 
exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or reduce the contractual interest rate. The reported amounts include loans that are new TDRs that may have COVID-19-related payment 
deferrals and exclude COVID-19-related payment deferrals on loans previously reported as TDRs given limited current financial effects other than payment deferral. 
Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged 
down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. 
Recorded investment related to interest rate reduction reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans 
reported as a principal primary modification type that also have an interest rate concession. 
Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue 
interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial 
effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the 
current period.

Table 5.18 summarizes permanent modification TDRs that 
defaulted during the period presented within 12 months of their 
permanent modification date. We are reporting these defaulted 
TDRs based on a payment default definition of 90 days past due 
for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past due for 
the consumer portfolio segment.

Note 6:  Mortgage Banking Activities 

Mortgage banking activities consist of residential and 

commercial mortgage originations, sales and servicing. 

We apply the amortization method to commercial MSRs and 

apply the fair value method to residential MSRs. The amortized 

cost of commercial MSRs was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, with an 
estimated fair value of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, at March 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively. Table 6.1 presents the changes in 
MSRs measured using the fair value method.

Includes impacts associated with exercising cleanup calls on securitizations and our right to repurchase delinquent loans from Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization 
pools. MSRs may increase upon repurchase due to servicing liabilities associated with these delinquent GNMA loans. 
Includes sales and transfers of MSRs, which can result in an increase in MSRs if related to portfolios with servicing liabilities. 
Includes prepayment rate changes as well as other valuation changes due to changes in mortgage interest rates. To reduce exposure to changes in interest rates, MSRs are economically hedged with 
derivative instruments. 
Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs. 
Represents other changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions, including prepayment rate estimation changes that are independent of mortgage interest rate changes. 
Represents the reduction in the MSR fair value for the cash flows expected to be collected during the period, net of income accreted due to the passage of time. 

Table 6.2 provides key weighted-average assumptions used 
in the valuation of residential MSRs and sensitivity of the current 
fair value of residential MSRs to immediate adverse changes in 
those assumptions. Amounts for residential MSRs include 

purchased servicing rights as well as servicing rights resulting 
from the transfer of loans. See Note 12 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) for additional information on key assumptions for 
residential MSRs.

Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 

The sensitivities in the preceding table are hypothetical and 
caution should be exercised when relying on this data. Changes in 
value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be 
extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the 
assumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also, the 
effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the 
other interests held is calculated independently without changing 

any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may 
result in changes in others, which might magnify or counteract 
the sensitivities.

In first quarter 2023, we executed letters of intent to sell mortgage servicing rights on approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year. 

At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had servicer 

advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, of 
$2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. As the servicer of loans 
for others, we advance certain payments of principal, interest, 
taxes, insurance, and default-related expenses which are 
generally reimbursed within a short timeframe from cash flows 
from the trust, government-sponsored entities (GSEs), insurer or 
borrower. 

The credit risk related to these advances is limited since the 
reimbursement is generally senior to cash payments to investors. 
We also advance payments of taxes and insurance for our owned

Servicing fees: 

loans which are collectible from the borrower. We maintain an 
allowance for uncollectible amounts for advances on loans 
serviced for others that may not be reimbursed if the payments 
were not made in accordance with applicable servicing 
agreements or if the insurance or servicing agreements contain 
limitations on reimbursements. Servicing advances on owned 
loans are charged-off when deemed uncollectible.

Note 8:  Leasing Activity 

The information below provides a summary of our leasing 
activities as a lessor and lessee. See Note 8 (Leasing Activity) in 
our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information about our leasing 
activities. 

As a Lessor 
Noninterest income on leases, included in Table 8.1, is included in 
other noninterest income on our consolidated statement of 
income. Lease expense, included in other noninterest expense on 
our consolidated statement of income, was $177 million and 
$188 million in first quarter 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

As a Lessee 
Substantially all of our leases are operating leases. Table 8.2 
presents balances for our operating leases.

Note 9:  Preferred Stock 

We are authorized to issue 20 million shares of preferred stock, 
without par value. Outstanding preferred shares rank senior to 
common shares both as to the payment of dividends and 
liquidation preferences but have no general voting rights. All 
outstanding preferred stock with a liquidation preference value, 
except for Series L Preferred Stock, may be redeemed for the 
liquidation preference value, plus any accrued but unpaid 
dividends, on any dividend payment date on or after the earliest 
redemption date for that series. Additionally, these same series 
of preferred stock may be redeemed following a “regulatory 

capital treatment event”, as described in the terms of each series. 
Capital actions, including redemptions of our preferred stock, 
may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions. 

In addition, we are authorized to issue 4 million shares of 

preference stock, without par value. We have not issued any 
preference shares under this authorization. If issued, preference 
shares would be limited to one vote per share.

At the option of the holder, each share of Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any time into 6.3814 shares of common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to anti-dilution 
adjustments. If converted within 30 days of certain liquidation or change of control events, the holder may receive up to 16.5916 additional shares, or, at our option, receive an equivalent amount of 
cash in lieu of common stock. We may convert some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130 percent of the 
conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days. We declared dividends of $74 million on Series L Preferred Stock for both 
quarters ended March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022.

Note 10:  Legal Actions 

Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a 
number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and 
other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising 
from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those 
proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential 
financial loss or other adverse consequences. These proceedings 
and investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo 
and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related 
matters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our 
subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our 
subsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or 
otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct 
of investigations of other persons or industry groups. 

We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses 

associated with the actions become probable and the costs can 
be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the 
amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of 
potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if 
we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low 
end of the range of those potential losses. There can be no 
assurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including 
the matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving 
legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the 
amounts accrued for those actions. 

AUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS  On April 20, 2018, the Company 
entered into consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things, investigations by 
the agencies into the Company’s compliance risk management 
program and its past practices involving certain automobile 
collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain 
mortgage interest rate lock extensions. Shareholders filed a 
putative securities fraud class action against the Company and its 
executive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions 
of CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In 
January 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants 
except the Company and a former executive officer and limited 
the action to two alleged misstatements. Subject to court 
approval, the parties have entered into an agreement pursuant to 
which the Company will pay $300 million to resolve this action. 
Additionally, a number of other lawsuits were filed by non-
governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies 
related to these CPI policies and related to the unused portion of 
guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance 
agreements. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into 
various settlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others were 
dismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, 
including the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, 
investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues 
related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer 
auto loans, including related insurance products. On 
December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to 
automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage 
lending. The consent order requires, among other things, 
remediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion civil 
penalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company 
entered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state 
attorneys general. 

COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS  Federal government agencies, 
including the United States Department of Labor (Department 
of Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions 
associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of 
the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 
401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with 
the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously 
disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve 
the Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, 
participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class 
action in the United States District Court for the District of 
Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with 
certain of these transactions. 

CONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION  Wells Fargo 
shareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action 
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York alleging that the Company and certain of its current 
and former executive officers and directors made false or 
misleading statements regarding the Company’s efforts to 
comply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal 
Reserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB 
and OCC. Allegations related to the Company’s efforts to comply 
with these three consent orders are also among the subjects of a 
shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in California state court. 

HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS  Government agencies, including the 
United States Department of Justice and the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or 
informal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company’s 
hiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud 
class action has also been filed in the United States District Court 
for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company 
and certain of its executive officers made false or misleading 
statements about the Company’s hiring practices related to 
diversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices 
related to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder 
derivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for 
the Northern District of California and in California state court. 

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION  Plaintiffs representing a class of 
merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual 
merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and 
Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated 
with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, 
MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding 
companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These 
actions have been consolidated in the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and 
consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based 
on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks 
damages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege 
that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully 
colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that 
enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged 
tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are 
anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other 
defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment 
Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other 
entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the

Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and 
the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed 
a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to 
resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate 
settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The 
settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the 
consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately 
$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants 
opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided 
for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of 
default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period 
of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final 
approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement 
objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the 
settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On 
June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement 
agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action 
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior 
class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, 
seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second 
Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 
2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead 
class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. 
The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve 
the damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a 
total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately 
$5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and 
$900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated 
responsibility for the additional funding is approximately 
$94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement 
on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector 
merchants. On March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the 
damages class settlement. Settlement objector merchants filed a 
petition for a rehearing by the Second Circuit en banc. On 
September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ 
motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several 
of the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled 
while others remain pending. 

OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION  The Company self-identified an 
issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo 
software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related 
financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States 
Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related 
to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as 
a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company made 
voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and cooperated with 
investigations or inquiries arising out of this matter by federal 
government agencies. In March 2023, the Company entered into 
agreements pursuant to which it agreed to pay $67.8 million to 
the Federal Reserve and $30 million to OFAC in order to resolve 
their investigations. 

RECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS  The United States Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the United States Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission have undertaken investigations 
regarding the Company’s compliance with records retention 
requirements relating to business communications sent over 
unapproved electronic messaging channels. 

RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION  In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF 
Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a 
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising 
similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the 
Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB 
Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the 
plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused 
losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based 
upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify 
and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for 
purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify 
investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate 
standards of care following alleged events of default. In 
July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light’s claims and 
certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and 
subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and 
Commerzbank AG appealed the district court’s decision to the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The 
Company previously settled two class actions filed by 
institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit 
Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park 
Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar 
lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 
as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of 
defective mortgage loan documentation. 

SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION  The Seminole Tribe of 
Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that 
Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with 
the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the 
assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended 
to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as 
plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. 

OUTLOOK  As described above, the Company establishes accruals 
for legal actions when potential losses associated with the 
actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably 
estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible 
losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and 
estimable losses was approximately $1.4 billion as of March 31, 
2023. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and 
subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to 
determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also 
inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there 
may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably 
possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses 
may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of 
reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently 
available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and 
established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual 
outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its 
subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a 
material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial 
condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a 
matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results 
of operations for any particular period.

Note 11:  Derivatives 

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. We 
designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in 
qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow 
hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for 
customer accommodation trading or other purposes. For 
additional information on our derivatives activities, see Note 14 
(Derivatives) in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Table 11.1:  Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of Derivatives 

Table 11.1 presents the total notional or contractual amounts 
and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative transactions can be 
measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is 
not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of 
the instruments. The notional amount is generally not 
exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which derivative cash 
flows are determined.

Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 

Balance Sheet Offsetting 
We execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under 
master netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable, these 
master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of 
default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as 
collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same 
counterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash 
collateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on 
a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net 
non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative 
balances on our consolidated balance sheet. 

For disclosure purposes, we present “Total Derivatives, net” 

which represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each 
counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting 

adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative 
exposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each 
counterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using 
master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral. 

Table 11.2 provides information on the fair values of 
derivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master 
netting arrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments 
and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our 
consolidated balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral 
associated with such arrangements. In addition to the netting 
amounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting 
related to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed 
within Note 15 (Pledged Assets and Collateral).

Represents amounts with counterparties subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that have been offset in our consolidated balance sheet, including portfolio level counterparty valuation 
adjustments related to customer accommodation and other trading derivatives. Counterparty valuation adjustments related to derivative assets were $346 million and $372 million and debit 
valuation adjustments related to derivative liabilities were $333 million and $331 million as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, and were primarily related to interest rate 
contracts. 
In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 

Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges 
For fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert 
certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of 
deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate 
risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency 
interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure 
to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the 
issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also 
enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap 
contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical 
commodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency 
interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against 
changes in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale 
(AFS) debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign 
currency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest 
rate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated 
amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain 
fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of 
cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency 
basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income 

(OCI). See Note 20 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the 
amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. 

For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge 
the variability in interest payments received on certain interest-
earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial 
loans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to 
changes in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use 
cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments 
on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due 
to changes in foreign exchange rates. 

We estimate $693 million pre-tax of deferred net losses 
related to cash flow hedges in OCI at March 31, 2023, will be 
reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve 
months. For cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2023, we are 
hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the 
variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for 
a maximum of 9 years. For additional information on our 
accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Table 11.3 and Table 11.4 show the net gains (losses) related 

to derivatives in cash flow and fair value hedging relationships, 
respectively.

Does not include the carrying amount of hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk. The carrying amount excluded for debt securities was $710 million and for long-
term debt was $0 million as of March 31, 2023, and $739 million for debt securities and $0 million for long-term debt as of December 31, 2022. 
Represents the full carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability item as of the balance sheet date, except for circumstances in which only a portion of the asset or liability was designated as the 
hedged item in which case only the portion designated is presented. 
The balance includes $37 million and $586 million of debt securities and long-term debt cumulative basis adjustments as of March 31, 2023, respectively, and $39 million and $334 million of debt 
securities and long-term debt cumulative basis adjustments as of December 31, 2022, respectively, on terminated hedges whereby the hedged items have subsequently been re-designated into 
existing hedges. 
Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. 
The balance includes cumulative basis adjustments of $(6) million for hedged items currently designated as of March 31, 2023, related to certain AFS debt securities designated as the hedged item in 
a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer method. At March 31, 2023, the aggregated designated hedged items using the portfolio layer method had a carrying amount of $19.9 billion from closed 
portfolios of financial assets totaling $23.3 billion. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include 
economic hedges and derivatives entered into for customer 
accommodation trading purposes. 

We use economic hedge derivatives to manage our exposure 

to interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign currency risk, and 
credit risk. We also use economic hedge derivatives to mitigate 
the periodic earnings volatility caused by mismatches between 
the changes in fair value of the hedged item and hedging 
instrument recognized on our fair value accounting hedges. 
Changes in the fair values of derivatives used to economically 
hedge the deferred compensation plan are reported in personnel 
expense.

Note 14 (Derivatives) in our 2022 Form 10-K.

Note 11:  Derivatives (continued) 

Credit Derivatives 
Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is 
derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or 
entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to 
another party (the seller of credit protection). We generally use 
credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk 
management objectives by purchasing and selling credit 
protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of 
credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help 
manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to 
perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of 
default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include 
events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of 
principal and/or interest payment. 

Table 11.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives.

Protection sold represents the estimated maximum 
exposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of 
default, the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of 
recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from 
collateral held or any economic hedges. 

The amounts under non-investment grade represent the 
notional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a 
higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the 
credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. 

We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets 

under the credit derivative have an external rating that is 
investment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify 
the credit derivative as non-investment grade. 

Our maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is 
managed through posted collateral and purchased credit 
derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order 
to achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk 
management is designed to provide an ability to recover a 
significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold 
credit derivatives. 

Credit-Risk Contingent Features 
Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if 
the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain 
major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand 
additional collateral or require termination or replacement of 
derivative instruments in a net liability position. Table 11.8 
illustrates our exposure to OTC bilateral derivative contracts with 
credit-risk contingent features, collateral we have posted, and 
the additional collateral we would be required to post if the credit 
rating of our debt was downgraded below investment grade.

Note 12:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure 
requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading 
or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 12.1 in this Note. 
Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments 
on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments 
typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value 
(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or 
application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable 
equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring 
basis are presented in Table 12.4 in this Note. We provide in 
Table 12.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that 
are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities 
carried at amortized cost. 

See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in 

our 2022 Form 10-K for discussion of how we determine fair 
value. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for 
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or 
nonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities 
recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations 
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the 
lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on 
significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K for a 
detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. 

In the determination of the classification of financial 
instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we 
consider all available information, including observable market 
data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our 
understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific 
facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument 
category and judgments are made regarding the significance of 
the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are 
considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. 
We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the 
fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value 
(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to 
measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published 
NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Includes net gains (losses) included in both net income and other comprehensive income. All amounts represent net gains (losses) included in net income except for $(16) million and $(21) million 
included in other comprehensive income from AFS debt securities, and $0 and $14 million in other comprehensive income from other liabilities for first quarter 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Includes originations of mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale. 
All assets and liabilities transferred into Level 3 were previously classified within Level 2. 
All assets and liabilities transferred out of Level 3 are classified as Level 2. During first quarter 2022, we transferred $8.9 billion of non-marketable equity securities and $1.4 billion of related 
economic hedging derivative assets (equity contracts) out of Level 3 due to our election to measure fair value of these instruments as a portfolio. Under this election, the unit of valuation is the 
portfolio-level, rather than each individual instrument. The unobservable inputs previously significant to the valuation of the instruments individually are no longer significant, as those unobservable 
inputs offset under the portfolio election. 
Includes net unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at period end included in both net income and other comprehensive income. All amounts represent net unrealized gains 
(losses) included in net income except for $(15) million and $(21) million included in other comprehensive income from AFS debt securities, and $0 and $14 million in other comprehensive income 
from other liabilities for first quarter 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Included in net gains from trading and securities on our consolidated statement of income. 
Included in mortgage banking income on our consolidated statement of income. 
For additional information on the changes in mortgage servicing rights, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities). 
Included in mortgage banking income, net gains from trading and securities, and other noninterest income on our consolidated statement of income. 
Included in other noninterest income on our consolidated statement of income. 
In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 

Table 12.3 provides quantitative information about the 
valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. 

The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets 
inherent in the fair values obtained from third-party vendors are 
not included in the table, as the specific inputs applied are not 

provided by the vendor (for additional information on vendor-
developed valuations, see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K). 

Weighted averages of inputs are calculated using 

outstanding unpaid principal balance for cash instruments, such 
as loans and securities, and notional amounts for derivative 
instruments.

The high end of the range of inputs is for servicing modified loans. For non-modified loans, the range is $52 - $177 at March 31, 2023, and $52 - $178 at December 31, 2022. 
Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 
In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). 
Consists of total Level 3 assets of $10.9 billion and $11.5 billion and total Level 3 liabilities of $5.0 billion and $4.9 billion, before netting of derivative balances, at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 
2022, respectively. 

For additional information on the valuation techniques and 

significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of our 
Level 3 assets and liabilities, including how changes in these 
inputs affect fair value estimates, see Note 15 (Fair Values of 
Assets and Liabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K.

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain 
assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with 
GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from 
application of LOCOM accounting, write-downs of individual 
assets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain 
nonmarketable equity securities. 

Table 12.4:  Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Table 12.4 provides the fair value hierarchy and fair value at 
the date of the nonrecurring fair value adjustment for all assets 
that were still held as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 
2022, and for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was 
recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and the year 
ended December 31, 2022.

Table 12.6 provides quantitative information about the 
valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of our Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value 
on a nonrecurring basis and determined using an internal model. 
The table is limited to financial instruments that had 
nonrecurring fair value adjustments during the periods 
presented. Weighted averages of inputs are calculated using 
outstanding unpaid principal balance for cash instruments, such 
as loans, and carrying value prior to the nonrecurring fair value 
measurement for nonmarketable equity securities and private 
equity and venture capital investments in consolidated portfolio 
companies. 

Table 12.5 presents the gains (losses) on certain assets held 

at the end of the reporting periods presented for which a 
nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recognized in earnings 
during the respective periods.

Fair Value Option 
The fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only 
permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, 
to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with 
changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair 
value option to align the measurement model with how the 
financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity 
or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the 

portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. For 
additional information, including the basis for our fair value 
option elections, see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Table 12.7 reflects differences between the fair value 
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities for which we have 
elected the fair value option and the contractual aggregate 
unpaid principal amount at maturity.

initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value, by

the fair value option was elected. Amounts recorded in net

For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk gains or 

For long-term debt, instrument-specific credit risk gains or 

losses are derived principally by determining the change in fair 
value of the loans due to changes in the observable or implied 
credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less 
the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. For 
nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to 
instrument-specific credit risk. For LHFS accounted for under the 
fair value option, instrument-specific credit gains or losses were 
insignificant during the first quarter of both 2023 and 2022. 

losses represent the impact of changes in fair value due to 
changes in our credit spread and are derived using observable 
secondary bond market information. These impacts are recorded 
within the debit valuation adjustments (DVA) in OCI. See 
Note 20 (Other Comprehensive Income) for additional 
information.

Note 12:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Table 12.9 presents a summary of fair value estimates for 
financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on a 
recurring basis. Some financial instruments are excluded from 
the scope of this table, such as certain insurance contracts, 
certain nonmarketable equity securities, and leases. This table 
also excludes assets and liabilities that are not financial 
instruments such as the value of the long-term relationships with 
our deposit, credit card and trust customers, MSRs, premises and 
equipment, goodwill and deferred taxes. 

Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and 
commercial and similar letters of credit are not included in 
Table 12.9. A reasonable estimate of the fair value of these 
instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the 
allowance for unfunded credit commitments, which totaled 
$689 million and $737 million at March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022, respectively. 

The total of the fair value calculations presented does not 

represent, and should not be construed to represent, the 
underlying fair value of the Company.

companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization 
transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. 
SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are 
generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE 
may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative 
transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various 
forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer 
financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in 
connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and 
sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets 
we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the 
right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the 
transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls 
below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the 
benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans 
transferred to a VIE by a third party. 

In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, 
we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which 
may include: 
• 

underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently 
making markets in those securities; 
providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs 
through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; 
entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; 
holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; 
acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; 
providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and 
providing seller financing to VIEs.

Loan Sales and Securitization Activity 
We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and 
other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan 
sale transactions. 

MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED 
ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal 
course of business we sell originated and purchased residential 
and commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored 
entities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into 
securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain 
credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer 
mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to 
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines 
which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or 
GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA 
design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the 
involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant 
to the VIE. 

We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage 
loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate 
the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for 
the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the 
VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment 
purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing 
rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option 

to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which 
becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments 
remain unpaid by the borrower. During the quarters ended 
March 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased loans of $92 million 
and $933 million, respectively, which primarily represented 
repurchases of government insured loans. We recorded assets 
and related liabilities of $935 million and $743 million at 
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, where we 
did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. 

Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for 

losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual 
representations and warranties as well as other recourse 
arrangements. At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our 
liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was 
$165 million and $167 million, respectively, and the maximum 
exposure to loss was $13.9 billion and $13.8 billion at March 31, 
2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to 
assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about 
residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and 
servicing fees. 

NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the 
normal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and 
commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that 
we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan 
securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, 
and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit 
risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We 
typically originate the transferred loans and account for the 
transfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the 
loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, 
such as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our 
servicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage 
loan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer. We 
do not consolidate the VIE because the most significant 
decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally 
made by the special servicer or the controlling class security 
holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan 
securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold 
variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are 
not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. 

WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS  We may also sell whole loans 
to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of 
financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not 
consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the 
most significant activities of the VIEs. 

Table 13.1 presents information about transfers of assets during 
the periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as 
sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred 
assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds 
and recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these 
interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are 
classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are 
classified as Level 2. The majority of our transfers relate to 
residential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and 
generally result in no gain or loss because the loans are measured 
at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer 
certain government insured loans that we previously

Represents assets or liabilities recognized at securitization settlement date related to our continuing involvement in the transferred assets. 
Represents debt securities obtained at securitization settlement held for investment purposes that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. In 2022, these predominantly related to

In the normal course of business, we purchase certain 
non-agency securities at initial securitization or subsequently in 
the secondary market, which we hold for investment. We also 
provide seller financing in the form of loans. During the quarters 
ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we received cash flows of $50 
million and $136 million, respectively, related to principal and 
interest payments on these securities and loans, which exclude 
cash flows related to trading activities.

Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information 
on key assumptions for residential MSRs. 

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES  We enter into resecuritization 
transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the 
investment and risk management activities of our customers. In 
resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities 
to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to 
third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This 
activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or 
risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the 
resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities 
issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not 
consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-
making power with third parties and do not hold significant 
economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making 
activities. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, 
we transferred securities of $3.2 billion and $6.4 billion, 
respectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained securities of 
$198 million and $738 million, respectively. These amounts are 
not included in Table 13.1. Related total VIE assets were 
$111.6 billion and $112.0 billion at March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022, we held $1.3 billion and $793 million of 
securities, respectively.

Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others 
Table 13.3 presents information about loans that we sold or 
securitized in which we have ongoing involvement as servicer. 
Delinquent loans include loans 90 days or more past due and 
loans in bankruptcy, regardless of delinquency status. For loans 
sold or securitized where servicing is our only form of continuing 
involvement, we generally experience a loss only if we were 
required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due 

to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our 
loan sale or servicing contracts. Table 13.3 excludes mortgage 
loans in GSE or GNMA securitizations of $693.2 billion and 
$704.5 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, 
respectively. Delinquent loans and foreclosed assets related to 
loans in GSE and GNMA securitizations were $3.6 billion and 
$4.6 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, 
respectively.

Table 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the 
unconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes 
investments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity 
agreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude 
certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our 
continuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature 
or insignificant in size. 

In Table 13.4, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining 
principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the 
most current information available. “Carrying value” is the 
amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our 
involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure 
to loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in 
the VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that 
have not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity 
and lending commitments, the notional amount of net written 
derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or 
stressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. 
Debt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts 

related to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and 
certain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, 
sold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. 

“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that 
would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for 
which we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as 
where the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset 
from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an 
indication of expected loss. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  Table 13.4 includes 
nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations where we 
originate and transfer the loans to the unconsolidated 
securitization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional information 
about these VIEs, see the “Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” 
section within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan 
securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan 
securitizations sponsored by third parties where we did not 
originate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and 
invest in securities that could be potentially significant to the 
VIE. 

Conforming loan securitization and resecuritization 
transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from 
Table 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have 
power over the activities most significant to the VIEs. 
Additionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the 
GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these 
VIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming 
mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the 
“Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” and “Resecuritization 
Activities” sections within this Note. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS  We may transfer purchased 
industrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to 
VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire 
such beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a 
transferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also 
service the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the 
bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and 
workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore 
we do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. 

OTHER VIE STRUCTURES  We engage in various forms of 
structured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including 
asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations 
collateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral 
may include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student 
loans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or 
marketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service 
one or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives 
with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We 
are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we 
do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the

Includes $205 million and $172 million of securities classified as trading at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 
All other assets includes mortgage servicing rights, derivative assets, and other assets (predominantly servicing advances). 

INVOLVEMENT WITH TAX CREDIT VIES  In addition to the 
unconsolidated VIEs in Table 13.4, we may invest in or provide 
funding to affordable housing, renewable energy or similar 
projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through 
the realization of federal tax credits and other tax benefits. The 
projects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have 
the power over the VIE’s assets, therefore, we do not consolidate 
the VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax 
credit VIEs was $18.6 billion and $18.7 billion at March 31, 2023, 
and December 31, 2022, respectively. We also had loans to tax 
credit VIEs with a carrying value of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion at 
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Our maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at 
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $28.7 billion and 
$28.0 billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss 
included total unfunded equity and lending commitments of 
$8.2 billion and $7.3 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 
2022, respectively. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other 
Commitments) for additional information about commitments 
to purchase equity securities. 

Our affordable housing equity investments qualify for the 

low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For additional 
information on our LIHTC investments, see Note 16 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) in our 2022 
Form 10-K. 

Consolidated VIEs 
We consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We 
are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES  We may 
securitize dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust 
entity. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the key 
decisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total VIE 
assets held by the master trust represent a majority of the total 
VIE assets presented for this category in Table 13.5. In a separate 
transaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and 
equity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to 
specific vendors and service the underlying collateral. 

OTHER VIE STRUCTURES  Other VIEs are predominantly related to 
municipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are 
vehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds through the 
issuance of short-term debt to investors. Our involvement with 
MTOBs includes serving as the residual interest holder, which 
provides control over the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the 
remarketing agent or liquidity provider related to the debt issued 
to investors. We may also securitize nonconforming mortgage 
loans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the 
underlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securities 
issued by the VIE. During second quarter 2022, we purchased the 
outstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and extinguished the 
related debt associated with such securitizations.

Table 13.5 presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities 
of our consolidated VIEs. The carrying value represents assets 
and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. “Total 
VIE assets” includes affiliate balances that are eliminated upon 
consolidation, and therefore in some instances will differ from 
the carrying value of assets. 

Table 13.5:  Transactions with Consolidated VIEs 

On our consolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose 

(1) the consolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be used 
to settle the liabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated 
liabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have 
recourse to Wells Fargo.

All other assets includes cash and due from banks, and other assets. 
Liabilities include short-term borrowings, and accrued expenses and other liabilities. 

Other Transactions 
In addition to the transactions included in the previous tables, we 
have used wholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to issue 
debt securities or preferred equity exclusively to third-party 
investors. As the sole assets of the VIEs are receivables from us, 
we do not consolidate the VIEs even though we own all of the 
voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the 
obligations of the VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the 
third-party securities under certain circumstances. On our 
consolidated balance sheet, we reported the debt securities 
issued to the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt with a 
carrying value of $404 million and $401 million at March 31, 
2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Note 14:  Guarantees and Other Commitments 

Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. For additional 

descriptions of our guarantees, see Note 17 (Guarantees and 
Other Commitments) in our 2022 Form 10-K. Table 14.1 shows 
carrying value and maximum exposure to loss on our guarantees.

Standby and direct pay letters of credit are reported net of syndications and participations. 
Represents recourse provided, predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. 
Includes indemnifications provided to certain third-party clearing agents. Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $210 million and $157 million with related collateral of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion 
as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss 

that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical 
circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, 
where the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in 
Table 14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could 
use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee 
agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of 
expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more 
representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum 
exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of 
the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if 
applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider 
the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. 

For our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-investment grade 

represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of 
performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is 
determined based on an external rating or an internal credit 
grade that is below investment grade. 

WRITTEN OPTIONS  We enter into written foreign currency 
options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are 
derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. 
The fair value of written options represents our view of the 
probability that we will be required to perform under the 
contract. The fair value of these written options was a liability of 
$150 million and $15 million at March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value may be an asset 
as a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The 
maximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these 
derivative contracts. At March 31, 2023, the maximum exposure 
to loss was $32.1 billion, with $29.8 billion expiring in three years 
or less compared with $23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, 

respectively, at December 31, 2022. See Note 11 (Derivatives) 
for additional information regarding written derivative contracts. 

MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES  We provide debit and credit 
card transaction processing services through payment networks 
directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing 
servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is 
accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the 
merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in 
connection with payment and delivery disputes between the 
merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the 
cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We 
estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total 
merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four 
months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back 
transaction. As of March 31, 2023, our potential maximum 
exposure was approximately $757.6 billion, and related losses, 
including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. 

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES  The Parent fully and 
unconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, 
and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 
100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may 
issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary 
of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $891 million and 
$948 million at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, 
respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the 
Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 

OTHER COMMITMENTS  To meet the financing needs of our 
customers, we may enter into commitments to purchase debt 
and equity securities to provide capital for their funding, liquidity 
or other future needs. As of March 31, 2023, and December 31,

2022, we had commitments to purchase debt securities of 
$249 million and $100 million and commitments to purchase 
equity securities of $4.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. 

As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing 

organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity 
to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen 
events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these 
obligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and 
accordingly are included in Table 14.1 in Other guarantees and 
indemnifications. 

We have commitments to enter into resale and securities 

borrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities 
lending agreements with certain counterparties, including central 
clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual 
commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements 
was $17.6 billion and $19.9 billion as of March 31, 2023, and 
December 31, 2022, respectively. The amount of our unfunded 
contractual commitments for repurchase and securities lending 
agreements was $2.5 billion and $1.6 billion as of March 31, 
2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded 

from Table 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 
(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).

Note 21:  Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by 
federal banking regulators. The FRB establishes capital 
requirements for the consolidated financial holding company, 
and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has 
similar requirements for the Company’s national banks, including 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). 

Table 21.1 presents regulatory capital information for the 

Company and the Bank in accordance with Basel III capital 
requirements. We must calculate our risk-based capital ratios 

Table 21.1:  Regulatory Capital Information 

under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The 
Standardized Approach applies assigned risk weights to broad 
risk categories, while the calculation of risk-weighted assets 
(RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by requiring 
applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which 
relies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an 
operational risk component. 

At March 31, 2023, the Bank and our other insured 

depository institutions were considered well-capitalized under 
the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches at March 31, 2023. 
The SLR consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of total average assets, less goodwill and other permitted Tier 1 capital deductions (net of 
deferred tax liabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. 
The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

At March 31, 2023, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 

and total capital ratio requirements for the Company included a 
global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 1.50%. 
The G-SIB surcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In addition, the 
CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the 
Company included a stress capital buffer of 3.20% under the 
Standardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of 
2.50% under the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio 
requirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer 
of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced 
Approaches. The Company is required to maintain these risk-
based capital ratios and to maintain an SLR of at least 5.00% 
(composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Bank 
is required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered 
well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy 
rules. 

Capital Planning Requirements 
The FRB’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain large bank holding 
companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB conducts an 
annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and 
has also published guidance regarding its supervisory 
expectations for capital planning, including capital policies 
regarding the process relating to common stock dividend and 
repurchase decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18. The Parent’s 
ability to make certain capital distributions is subject to the 
requirements of the capital plan rule and is also subject to the 
Parent meeting or exceeding certain regulatory capital 
minimums.

Loan and Dividend Restrictions 
Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit 
and non-credit transactions between a bank and its nonbank 
affiliates. Additionally, federal laws and regulations limit the 
dividends that a national bank may pay. 

Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal 

and state statutory provisions and regulations covering the 
amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year. In 
addition, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as 
amended and restated on June 26, 2019, among Wells Fargo & 
Company, the parent holding company (Parent), WFC Holdings, 
LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the 
Parent (IHC), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo 
Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the 
Parent designated from time to time as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as 
related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be 
restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if 
certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers 
or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

For additional information on loan and dividend 

restrictions, see Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and 
Other Restrictions) in our 2022 Form 10-K.
