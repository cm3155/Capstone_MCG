Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control 

infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The 
Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or 
delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues o
  r  
delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on 
others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulator
y  
action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, 
business restrictions, enforcement actions, and other negative 
consequences, which could be significant. While we still have 
significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspec
of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to 
devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong 
business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of 
integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place.

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 

provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second 
third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy 
and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the 
OCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the 
Company related to insufficient progress in addressing 
requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss 
mitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. 
On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to 
clarify how it would terminate. 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the 
execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party

Recent Developments 
LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely 
referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at 
which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. 
On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 
Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator 
of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no 
longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 
2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR 
settings would no longer be published on a representative basis 
after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions 
convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate 
the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the 
Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference 
Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. 
In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) 
Act (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide 
a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate 
based on SOFR in U.S. law contracts that do not have fallback 
provisions or that have fallback provisions resulting in a 
replacement rate based on LIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule 
implementing the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022, which will 
become effective on February 27, 2023. We expect that the 
LIBOR Act will transition certain of our legacy USD LIBOR 
contracts that do not have appropriate fallback provisions to the 
applicable SOFR-based replacement rates specified in the FRB’s 
final rule. 

We no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR, subject 
to limited exceptions based on regulatory guidance. During 2022, 
we executed certain LIBOR transition activities to enhance our 
operational readiness such as the development of new 
alternative reference rate products, model and system updates, 
and employee training. 

For certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities 
and related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with 
our clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR-
based rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the 
June 30, 2023 cessation date. 

Following June 30, 2023, we expect substantially all of our 

consumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, 
derivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to 
transition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in 
accordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. 

For additional information regarding the risks and potential 

impact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being 
significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the “Risk 
Factors” section in this Report. 

residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile 
Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage 
Lending 
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer 
remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, 
consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain 
practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive 
refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile 
protection agreements; comply with certain business practice 
requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a 
$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related 
to many of these matters were already substantially complete at 
the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent 
order lays out a path to termination after the Company 
completes the remainder of the required actions. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB 
consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk 
Factors” section and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify 
areas or instances where customers may have experienced 
financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and 
implement additional operational and control procedures. We are 
working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. 

We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs 
related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts 
may change based on additional facts and information, as well as 
ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our 
ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our 
risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the 
future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To 
the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any 
customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have 
previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. 

For additional information regarding accruals for customer 

remediation, see the “Expenses” section in Note 20 (Revenue and 
Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for 
additional information regarding these activities, including 
related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section 
and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

 2022, compared with 

 2021, included 

total revenue decreased due to lower net gains from equity 
securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and 
other asset-based fee income, partially offset by higher net 
interest income; 
provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth 
and a less favorable economic environment; 
noninterest expense increased due to higher operating 
losses, partially offset by lower personnel expense, and 
professional and outside services expense; 
average loans increased driven by loan growth across both 
our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
average deposits decreased driven by reductions in 
Corporate and Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, 
Wealth and Investment Management, and Corporate, 
partially offset by growth in Consumer Banking and Lending.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in 2022. Total equity of 
$181.9 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased compared with 
$190.1 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in 
accumulated other comprehensive income due to net unrealized 
losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. Our liquidity 
and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 
2022, including: 
• 

 10.60%  under  

our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 
the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$13.6 billion at December 31, 2022, decreased $179 million 
from December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty 
around the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
our loan portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by loan 
growth and a less favorable economic environment. 
Our provision for credit losses for loans was $1.5 billion in 
2022, compared with $(4.2) billion in 2021, reflecting loan 
growth and a less favorable economic environment. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.42% at 
December 31, 2022, compared with 1.54% at December 31, 
2021. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $79 million, 
or 1 basis point of average commercial loans, in 2022, 
compared with net loan charge-offs of $295 million, or 
6 basis points, in 2021, driven by lower losses in our 
commercial and industrial and commercial real estate 
mortgage portfolios. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $1.5 billion, or 
39 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2022, 
compared with net loan charge-offs of $1.3 billion, or

Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity. 
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible 
common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
See the “Capital Management” section and Note 25 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
Represents TLAC divided by risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. 
Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared per common share as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share. 
Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding.

Earnings Performance

Wells Fargo net income for 2022 was $13.2 billion ($3.14 diluted 
EPS), compared with $21.5 billion ($4.95 diluted EPS) in 2021. 
Net income decreased in 2022, compared with 2021, due to a 
$13.9 billion decrease in noninterest income, a $5.7 billion 
increase in provision for credit losses, and a $3.5 billion increase 
in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $9.2 billion increase 
in net interest income, a $3.5 billion decrease in income tax 
expense, and a $2.0 billion decrease in net income from 
noncontrolling interests. 

Net interest income and net interest margin increased in 
2022, compared with 2021, due to the impact of higher interest 
rates on earning assets, higher loan balances, and lower 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, 
partially offset by lower interest income from Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) loans and loans purchased from 
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan 
securitization pools, and higher expenses for interest-bearing 
deposits and long-term debt. 

For a discussion of our 2021 financial results, compared with 

Table 3 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 3 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020. 

2020, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. 

Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio 
and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources 
of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and 
collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from 
period to period.

Table 4 allocates the changes in net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or 
average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume 
and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely 

allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, 
changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are 
allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based on the 
absolute value of the change due to average volume and average 
rate.

partially offset by: 
•	

lower fee waivers as 2021 included additional 
accommodations to support customers. 

Lending-related fees decreased reflecting lower commercial 
loan commitment fees. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting: 
•	

lower asset-based and trust fees due to divestitures in 2021; 
and 
lower average market valuations. 

•	

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory

Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market 
activity. 

Card fees increased reflecting higher network revenue as well as 
higher interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased 
purchase and transaction volumes.

Net servicing income increased driven by a lower decline in 
residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) as a result of 
reduced prepayment rates, partially offset by net unfavorable 
hedge results due to interest rate volatility. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
•	

lower residential mortgage origination volumes and lower 
gain on sale margins; and 
lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 

•	

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 6 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities increased driven by higher 
commodities, foreign exchange, rates, and equities trading 
revenue. 

Net gains from debt securities decreased due to lower gains on 
sales of corporate debt securities and agency MBS. 

•	

Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
•	
lower unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
driven by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; 
a $2.5 billion impairment of equity securities (before the 
impact of noncontrolling interests) in 2022 predominantly in 
our affiliated venture capital business driven by market 
conditions; and 
lower realized gains on the sales of equity securities. 

•	

Lease income increased driven by a $268 million impairment in 
2021 of certain rail cars in our rail car leasing business that are 
used for the transportation of coal products.

Management (WFAM); and 
higher amortization due to growth in wind energy

. We define our reportable operating 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed 
with our Chief Executive 
management. The management reporting process is based on 
U.S.  GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds 
transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenu
and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt 
sources, which allows management to assess performance 
consistently across the operating segments. 

 Officer  and relevant senior 

e  

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 

Table 8:  Management Reporting Structure 

business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see the “Corporate” section below.
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are 
included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers.
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits.
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases.
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others.
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale.
Excludes nonaccrual loans.
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 

Revenue increased driven by:
•

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and higher average deposit balances and deposit spreads;
higher card fees reflecting higher network revenue as well as 
higher interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased 
purchase and transaction volumes; and
higher deposit-related fees reflecting lower fee waivers as 
2021 included additional accommodations to support 
customers, and a higher volume of monthly account service 
fees in 2022, partially offset by the elimination of non-
sufficient funds and other fees in 2022 as well as initiatives 
to help customers avoid overdraft fees; 

partially offset by:
•

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
origination volumes and gain on sale margins, and lower 

revenue related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools.

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth, a 
less favorable economic environment, and higher net charge-
offs.

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
•

higher operating losses reflecting higher expenses primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, 
regulatory, and customer remediation matters; and
higher operating costs;

•
partially offset by:
•

lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related 
incentive compensation in Home Lending due to lower 
production and the impact of efficiency initiatives, partially 
offset by higher severance expense;

Total deposits (average) increased driven by higher levels of 
customer liquidity and savings in the first half of 2022, partially 
offset by increased consumer spending in the second half of 
2022, customers continuing to allocate more cash into higher 
yielding liquid alternatives, and lower servicing escrow deposits.

Total deposits (period-end) decreased driven by increased

Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 

Total loans (average) decreased driven by:
•

a decline in PPP loans in Consumer and Small Business 
Banking; and
a decline in Home Lending loan balances due to the 
resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA loan 
securitization pools and the continued pause in originating 
home equity loans;

partially offset by:
•

higher customer purchase volume and the impact of new 
products in our Credit Card business; and
higher loan balances in our Auto business.

•

•

Total loans (period-end) increased driven by: 
•
•

originations exceeding paydowns in Home Lending; 
higher customer purchase volume and the impact of new 
products in our Credit Card business; and
growth in our Personal Lending business;

•
partially offset by:
•

a decline in our Auto business due to lower origination 
volumes reflecting credit tightening actions and rising 
interest rates; and
a decline in PPP loans in Consumer and Small Business 
Banking.

Revenue increased driven by:
•

•

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads as well as higher loan balances; and
higher other noninterest income driven by higher net gains 
from equity securities and higher income from renewable 
energy investments;

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less 
favorable economic environment, partially offset by lower net 
charge-offs.

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs 
and operating losses, partially offset by the impact of efficiency 
initiatives.

partially offset by:
•

lower deposit-related fees driven by the impact of higher 
earnings credit rates, which result in lower fees for 
commercial customers.

Revenue increased driven by:
•

•

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates as 
well as higher loan balances; and 
higher net gains from trading activities driven by higher 
commodities, foreign exchange, rates, and equities trading 
revenue; 
partially offset by:
•

lower investment banking fees due to lower market activity; 
and

•

lower other noninterest income driven by lower mortgage 
banking income due to lower commercial MBS gain on sale 
margins and volumes.

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less 
favorable economic environment.

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs 
and operating losses, partially offset by the impact of efficiency 
initiatives.

Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 

Total assets (average and period-end) increased driven by 
higher loan balances reflecting broad-based loan demand driven 
by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased client 
working capital needs.

Total deposits (average) decreased driven by customers 
continuing to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid 
alternatives as well as actions taken in 2021 and early 2022 to 
manage under the asset cap.

Total deposits (period-end) decreased driven by customers 
continuing to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid

NM – Not meaningful
(1)

Represents annualized segment total revenue divided by average total financial and wealth advisors for the period.

Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021

Revenue increased driven by:
•

higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates, 
partially offset by lower deposit balances; 

•

Noninterest expense decreased driven by:
•

lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related 
compensation; and
the impact of efficiency initiatives.

partially offset by:
•

lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to lower average market valuations and net outflows of 
advisory assets; and
lower commissions and brokerage services fees driven by 
lower transactional revenue.

•

Total deposits (period-end) decreased as customers continued 
to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives.

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less 
favorable economic environment.

Earnings Performance (continued)
 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 9h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes 
that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows 
management, investors, and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 

the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 
basis points.

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, 
net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, 
liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable 
operating segments as well as our investment portfolio and 
affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In 
addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to 
our efficiency initiatives. See Note 20 (Revenue and Expenses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on 
restructuring charges. Corporate also includes certain lines of 
business that management has determined are no longer 

consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as 
well as results for previously divested businesses. In fourth 
quarter 2021, we completed the sales of Wells Fargo Asset 
Management (WFAM) and our Corporate Trust Services 
business; however, we continue to provide certain services 
related to these businesses pursuant to transition services 
agreements. The transition services agreement related to the 
sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business 
terminated in June 2022. Table 9i and Table 9j provide additional

NM – Not meaningful 
(1)	

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 

Full year 2022 vs. full year 2021 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
•	

lower net gains from equity securities due to lower 
unrealized and realized gains on nonmarketable equity 
securities from our affiliated venture capital and private 
equity businesses, and higher impairment driven by market 
conditions; 
lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees 
reflecting divestitures in 2021; 
lower gains on sales of corporate debt securities; and 
gains in 2021 on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services 
business, our student loan portfolio, and WFAM; 

partially offset by: 
•	
•	

higher net gains from trading activities; 
lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we sold; and 
higher lease income driven by a $268 million impairment in 
2021 of certain rail cars in our rail car leasing business that 
are used for the transportation of coal products. 

•	

•	
•	

•	

Provision for credit losses decreased due to lower net charge-
offs driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio in 2021. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
•	

higher operating losses reflecting higher expenses primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation 
and regulatory matters; 

partially offset by: 
•	
•	

the impact of divestitures; 
a write-down of goodwill in 2021 related to the sale of our 
student loan portfolio; 
lower lease expense driven by lower depreciation expense 
from a reduction in the size of our rail car leasing business; 
and 
lower restructuring charges. 

•	

•	

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets, net of accumulated 
depreciation, of $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The average age of 
our rail cars is 22 years and the rail cars are typically leased to 
customers under short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our three 
largest concentrations, which represented 55% of our rail car 
fleet as of December 31, 2022, were rail cars used for the 
transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand 
products. Impairment may result in the future based on changing 
economic and market conditions affecting the long-term 
demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions 
for impairment are sensitive to estimated utilization and rental 
rates as well as the estimated economic life of the leased asset. 
For additional information on the accounting for impairment of 
operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 8 (Leasing Activity) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Total assets (average and period-end) decreased reflecting: 
•	
a decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
managed by corporate treasury as a result of payments on 
long-term debt and an increase in loans originated in the 
operating segments; and 
lower available-for-sale debt securities due to sales and net 
unrealized losses as well as a transfer from available-for-sale 
debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities related 
to portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk. 

•	

Total deposits (average) decreased driven by the transition of 
deposits related to divested businesses. 

Total deposits (period-end) increased driven by issuances of 
certificates of deposit (CDs), partially offset by the transition of 
deposits related to divested businesses.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $6 million and $8 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $85 million and $96 million related to 
held-to-maturity debt securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 
2021. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities were more than 
offset by portfolio runoff and AFS debt security sales. In addition, 
we transferred AFS debt securities with a fair value of 
$50.1 billion to HTM debt securities in 2022 due to actions taken 
to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management 
purposes. Debt securities transferred from AFS to HTM in 2022 
had $4.5 billion of pre-tax unrealized losses at the time of the 
transfers. 

The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt 
securities at December 31, 2022, were driven by higher interest 
rates and wider credit spreads. 
At  December 31, 2022

,  99% of the combined AFS and HTM

based on external ratings where available and, where not

Table 10 presents a summary of our portfolio of 

investments in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity 
(HTM) debt securities. The size and composition of our AFS and 
HTM debt securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity 
and interest rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt 
securities portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise 
in the normal course of business or due to market stress. 
Changes in our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes 
in overall economic or market conditions, which could influence 
loan origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances 
and mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be 
rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk 
management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and 
interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt 
securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other 
short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for additional information 
on liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. 
states and political subdivisions and highly rated collateralized 
loan obligations (CLOs). 

The HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. 
states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Debt 
securities are classified as HTM at the time of purchase or when 
transferred from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Our intent is 
to hold these securities to maturity and collect the contractual 
cash flows. In January 2023, we changed our intent with respect 
to HTM debt securities with an amortized cost of $23.9 billion 
and reclassified them to AFS in connection with the adoption of a 
new accounting standard. For additional information, see the 
“Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report.

Loan Portfolios 
Table 11 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased from 
December 31, 2021, predominantly due to an increase in the 
commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan 
demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, 
partially offset by paydowns. Consumer loans increased from

Total loans 

December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in the 
residential mortgage portfolio due to loan originations, partially 
offset by loan paydowns and the transfer of first lien mortgage 
loans to loans held for sale (LHFS), which predominantly related 
to loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior 
periods.

Deposits 
Deposits decreased from December 31, 2021, reflecting: 
•	

customers continuing to allocate more cash into higher 
yielding liquid alternatives; 
increased consumer spending; and 
the transition of deposits related to divested businesses; 

•	
• 
partially offset by: 
•	

higher time deposits driven by issuances of certificates of 
deposit (CDs).

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, total deposits that 
exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance 
limits, or are otherwise uninsured, were estimated to be $510 
billion and $590 billion, respectively. Estimated uninsured 
domestic deposits reflect amounts disclosed in the U.S. 
regulatory reports of our subsidiary banks, with adjustments for 

Table 14:  Uninsured Time Deposits by Maturity 

amounts related to consolidated subsidiaries. All non-U.S. 
deposits are treated for these purposes as uninsured. 

Table 14 presents the contractual maturities of estimated 
time deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits, or are otherwise 
uninsured. All non-U.S. time deposits are uninsured.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements


In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. 
These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs 
of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, 
and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring 
activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to 
individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity 
structure of these commitments. For additional information, see 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 16 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 17 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management


Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

Risk is Part of our Business Model.  Risk is the possibility of an 
event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability 
to achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company 
routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its 
customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest 
rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, 
such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model 
risks, and strategic and reputation risks. 

Risk Profile.  The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the 
aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and 
business activities after taking into consideration risk 
management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk 
profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. 

Risk Capacity.  Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that 
the Company could assume given its current level of resources 
before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital 
and liquidity needs. 

Risk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk 
capacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current 
level of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of 
Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what 
level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s 
Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, 
approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the 
Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously 
monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which 
include risk appetite information and analysis. 

Risk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the 
Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the 
Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, 
develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and 
trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk 
appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in 
the strategic planning process, which is linked with the 
Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent 
Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic 
planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of 
the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also 
independently assesses and challenges the impact of the 
strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk 
management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, 
enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, 
the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s 
evaluation. 

Risk and Climate Change.  The Company is committed to helping 
mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities 
and to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and 
customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate 
change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the 
Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into 
its risk management framework as its understanding of climate 
change and risks driven by it evolve. 

Risk is Managed by Everyone.  Every employee, in the course of 
their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing 
risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, 
including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control 
environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, 
regulations, and Company policies. 

Risk and Culture.  Senior management sets the tone at the top 
by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s 
expectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves 
and make decisions. The Board oversees senior management in 
establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively 
managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak 
up when they see something that could cause harm to the 
Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, 
or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s 
responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to 
challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their 
concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s 
performance management and incentive compensation 
programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk 
and reward under core principles that employees are expected to 
know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources 
Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing 
credible challenge to the Company’s performance management 
and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk 
management is a central component of employee performance 
evaluations. 

Risk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk 
management framework sets forth the Company’s core 
principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by 
the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. 
Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by 
building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We 
continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, 
including operational and compliance risk management programs 
as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s 
April 20, 2018, consent orders. 

Risk Governance 
Role of the Board.  The Board oversees the Company’s business, 
including its risk management. It assesses senior management’s 
performance and holds senior management accountable for 
maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management 
program. 

Board Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk 
oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. 
The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk 
management framework and oversees management’s 
implementation of the framework, including how the Company 
manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the 
Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk 
Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of 
IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee

Management Committee Structure.  The Company has 
established management committees, including those focused 
on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance 
and risk management responsibilities. One type of management 
committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-
making body that operates for a particular purpose and may 
report to a Board committee. 

Each management governance committee, in accordance 

with its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make 
decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging 

risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review 
and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and 
remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key 
challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues 
as appropriate. 

Table 15 presents, as of December 31, 2022, the structure 

of the Company’s Board committees and escalation paths of 
relevant management governance committees reporting to a 
Board committee.

(1) 

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and 
external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 

Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk 
Committee of the Board.  The Enterprise Risk & Control 
Committee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that 
governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives 
information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated 
risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC 
also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to 
the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives 
regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management 
regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management program. 

The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its 

membership is comprised of principal line of business and certain 
enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee 
attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct 
escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an 
escalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the 
Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate 
anything directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to 
the ERCC in accordance with the Company’s escalation 
management policy. 

Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a 
risk and control committee, which is a management governance 
committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its 
scope limited to the respective principal line of business or 

enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider 
risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise 
function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line 
of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. 
As a complement to these risk and control committees, 
management governance committees dedicated to specific risk 
types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more 
comprehensive governance of risks. 

Risk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities 
The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the 
Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. 
•	

Front Line  The Front Line, which comprises principal line of 
business and certain enterprise function activities, is the first 
line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for 
understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying 
adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its 
business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and 
assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated 
by or associated with its business activities and balances risk 
and reward in decision making while operating within the 
Company’s risk appetite. 
Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of 
defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk 
management program and provides oversight, including

challenge to and independent assessment of, the Front 
Line’s execution of its risk management responsibilities. 
Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is 
responsible for acting as an independent assurance function 
and validates that the risk management program is 
adequately designed and functioning effectively. 

Risk Type Classifications 
The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and 
ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs 
and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit 
the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, 
including emerging risk exposures. 

Operational Risk Management 
Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this 
section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems, or from external events. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including 
significant supporting programs and/or policies regarding the 
Company’s business resiliency and disaster recovery, change 
management, data management, information security, 
technology, and third-party risk management. As part of its 
oversight responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee reviews 
and approves significant operational risk policies and oversees 
the Company’s operational risk management program. 

At the management level, Operational Risk Management, 

which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational 
risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and 
provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s 
oversight responsibilities include change management risk, data 
management risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, information 
management risk, information security risk, technology risk, and 
third-party risk. 

Information security is a significant operational risk for 

financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the risk 
arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction of information or information 
systems. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the 
Company’s information security risk management and cyber 
defense programs. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for information security risk and 
approves the Company’s information security program, which 
includes the information security policy and the cyber defense 
program. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our 
third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various 
evolving and adaptive information security threats, including 
cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software 
intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, 
phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, 
in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test 
their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain 
confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks 
have also focused on targeting online applications and services, 
such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products 
and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the 
infrastructure of the internet causing the widespread 
unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As 
a result, information security and the continued development 
and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems 
designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data 

from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for 
Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is also proactively involved in industry 
cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including 
our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to 
continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to 
information security threats. See the “Risk Factors” section in 
this Report for additional information regarding the risks 
associated with a failure or breach of our operational or security 
systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks. 

Compliance Risk Management 
Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting 
from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and 
rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately 
address associated impact, including to customers. Compliance 
risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, 
program requirements, procedures, and standards related to 
ethical principles applicable to the Company. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial 
crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s 
Risk Committee reviews and approves significant supporting 
compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs 
and oversees the Company’s compliance risk management and 
financial crimes risk management programs. 

Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of 

inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of 
employees or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, 
caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business 
practices. In connection with its oversight of conduct risk, the 
Board oversees the alignment of employee conduct to the 
Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility 
for conduct risk and risk management components of the 
Company’s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board’s 
Human Resources Committee include oversight of the 
Company’s culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, 
human capital management (including talent management and 
succession planning), performance management program, and 
incentive compensation risk management program. 

At the management level, the Compliance function, which is 

part of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company’s 
compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk 
Management, which is part of the Compliance function, oversees 
and monitors financial crimes risk. The Compliance function 
reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to 
compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Model Risk Management 
Model risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the 
potential for adverse consequences of decisions made based on 
model output that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the 
Company’s model risk management policy, model governance, 
model performance, model issue remediation status, and 
adherence to model risk appetite metrics. 

At the management level, the Model Risk function, which is 

part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for model risk and is 
responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of model 
risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports to the 
CRO and provides periodic reports related to model risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee.

Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity arising 
from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of 
strategic initiatives, or inadequate responses to changes in the 
external operating environment. 

The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic 

planning and oversees management’s development and 
implementation of and approves the Company’s strategic plan, 
and considers whether it is aligned with the Company’s risk 
appetite and risk management effectiveness. Management 
develops, executes and recommends significant strategic 
corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management’s 
proposals, including their impact on the Company’s risk profile 
and financial position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the 
adequacy of the Company’s strategic risk management program, 
including associated risk management practices, processes and 
controls. The Board’s Risk Committee also receives updates from 
management regarding new business initiatives activity and risks 
related to new or changing products, as appropriate. 

At the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight 

function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight function reports into 
the CRO and supports periodic reports related to strategic risk 
provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Reputation Risk Management 
Reputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that 
negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the 
Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely 
impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, 
cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. 
Key stakeholders include customers, employees, communities, 
shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and 
media organizations. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for reputation risk, while each Board committee 
has reputation risk oversight responsibilities related to their 
primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives reports 
from management that help it monitor how effectively the 
Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the 
Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports 
from management relating to stakeholder perceptions of the 
Company. 

At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight 
function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight function reports 
into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to reputation 
risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of the Company’s assets and exposures such as debt security 
holdings, certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, 
which is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight 
responsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the 
CRO and supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided 
to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio  Our loan portfolios represent the largest 
component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which 
we have credit risk. Table 16 presents our total loans outstanding 
by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into its credit risk management activities. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

  Measuring and monitoring 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
 (Loans and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses
) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

 Note 5 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $12.6 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2022, 
compared with $13.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline 
was driven by decreases in the technology, telecom and media, 
real estate and construction, and oil, gas and pipelines industries, 
as these industries continued to recover from the economic 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an 
increase in the materials and commodities, and equipment, 
machinery and parts manufacturing industries. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio increased at December 31, 2022, compared 
with December 31, 2021, driven by higher loan demand resulting 
in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by 
paydowns. Table 18 provides our commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based 
on the North American Industry Classification System.

repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering 
into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to perform under the 
agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to 
thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide 
additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or 
additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of

The total CRE loan portfolio increased $8.0 billion from 

December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in loans 
for apartments and industrial/warehouse property types, 
partially offset by a decrease in loans for the shopping center 
property type. The CRE loan portfolio included $7.6 billion of 
non-U.S. CRE loans at December 31, 2022, down from 
$8.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The portfolio is diversified 
both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic 
concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Texas, 
and Florida, which represented a combined 49% of the total CRE 
portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are 
apartments at 26% and office buildings at 23% of the portfolio. 
The unfunded credit commitments were $8.8 billion and 
$11.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for 
CRE mortgage loans and $20.7 billion and $20.0 billion, 
respectively, for CRE construction loans. 

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued)
 

repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside 
repayment guarantee in providing the extension. 

Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly 

related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and 
willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 
more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis as well as other lenders’ experience with 
the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance 
for credit losses methodology. 

In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate 
the collateral and future cash flows as well as the anticipated 
support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the 
strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full 
repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely 
collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the 
performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual 
status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in 
accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net 
realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  Our CRE loan portfolio is 
comprised of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. We 
generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using 
our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had 
$11.3 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at 
December 31, 2022, compared with $13.1 billion at 
December 31, 2021, and $1.1 billion of CRE construction loans 
classified as criticized at December 31, 2022, compared with 
$1.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in criticized CRE 
loans was driven by the hotel/motel and shopping center 
property types, as these property types continued to recover 
from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially 
offset by an increase in the office buildings and apartment 
property types. Criticized CRE loans at December 31, 2022, 
increased compared with September 30, 2022, primarily due to 
an increase in the office buildings property type. The credit 
quality of the office buildings property type could continue to be 
adversely affected if weakened demand for office space 
continues to drive higher vacancy rates and deteriorating 
operating performance. At December 31, 2022, nearly one-third 
of the CRE loans in the office buildings property type had 
recourse to a guarantor, typically through a repayment 
guarantee, in addition to the related collateral.

Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit. For additional information on issued letters of credit, see 
Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Includes 40 states; no state in Other had loans in excess of $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At December 31, 2022, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$87.5 billion, representing approximately 9% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $86.9 billion, or 
approximately 10% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, 
at December 31, 2021. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 5% 
and 4% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2022 
and 2021, respectively. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, 

which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

December 31, 2022, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$33.2 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $5.5 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch. 

Table 20 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 20: 
•	

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $51.2 billion exposure to financial institutions and $53.4 billion to non-financial corporations at December 31, 2022. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1–4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 95% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 
2022, compared with 94% at December 31, 2021. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with 

adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a 
result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that 
limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. 
The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. 
ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2022 
and 2021, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the 
majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2022. We do not offer 
option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage 
products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to 
within the financial services industry as negative amortizing 
mortgage loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. 
These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only 
payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar 
features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit 
performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio 
for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity 
of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan 
is delinquent. 

The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of 
credit was $18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded 
credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $35.5 billion 
at December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit 

(both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 
or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options 
available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% 
of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. As of 
December 31, 2022, a significant portion of the lines of credit in 
a draw period used the interest-only option. The lines that enter 
their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies 
and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period. 
We have considered this increased risk in our ACL for loans 
estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were approximately 2% 
and 3% of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 
increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

In anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit 
borrowers reaching the end of their draw period, we have created 
a program to inform, educate and help these borrowers 
transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or full 
repayment. We monitor the performance of the borrowers 
moving through the program in an effort to refine our ongoing 
program strategy.

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based 
tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have 
processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk 
management guidelines addressing the circumstances when 
AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of 
appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and 
junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit 
line products) to property collateral value. For additional 
information regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions 

Table 21:  Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio Performance 

such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in 
some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally 
include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after 
successful completion and compliance with terms during this 
period, the loan is permanently modified. Loans included under 
these programs are accounted for as troubled debt 
restructurings (TDRs) at the start of the trial period or at the 
time of permanent modification, if no trial period is used. 
Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition 
of delinquencies. For additional information on customer 
accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio increased $13.5 billion from 
December 31, 2021, driven by originations, partially offset by 
loan paydowns and the transfer of first lien mortgage loans to 
loans held for sale (LHFS), which predominantly related to loans 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods. 
Table 21 shows certain delinquency and loss information for 

the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio and lists the top 
five states by outstanding balance.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
•	

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes 
uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; 
they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential 
mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the 
loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; 
part of the principal balance has been charged off; or 
for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the 
related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in 
the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status. 

•	

•	
•	

Certain nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status 

after they perform for a period of time. Consumer credit card 
loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally fu
charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due. 

lly  

Customer payment deferral activities in the residential 
mortgage portfolio instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of nonaccrual 
loans for those residential mortgage customers who would have 
otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For additional 
information on customer accommodations, including loan 
modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $553 million from 
December 31, 2021, due to improved credit quality across our 
commercial loan portfolios. For additional information on 
commercial nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 
Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $1.0 billion from 
December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans primarily due to sustained payment 
performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-19-related 
accommodation programs.

We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in 
developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to 
losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors 
at December 31, 2022: 
•	

97% of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured, the 
majority of which are secured by real estate. 
81% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 77% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain.

As part of our actions to support customers during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended certain 
residential mortgage foreclosure activities through 
December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, we resumed 
these mortgage foreclosure activities. For additional information 
on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 5 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 27 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2021, 
predominantly driven by a decrease in residential mortgage 
loans, partially offset by an increase in trial modifications. The 
decrease in residential mortgage loans was due to paydowns and 
transfers to LHFS, which related to loans purchased from GNMA 
loan securitization pools. In January 2023, we adopted a new 

accounting standard that eliminates the accounting and 
reporting guidance for TDRs. For additional information, see the 
“Current Accounting Developments” section in this Report. 

The amount of our TDRs at December 31, 2022, would have 

otherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) 
and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and 
Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers 
Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (Interagency Statement). 
Customers who are unable to resume making their contractual 
loan payments upon exiting from these deferral programs may 
require further assistance and may receive or be eligible to 
receive modifications, which may be classified as TDRs. For 
additional information on customer accommodations, including 
loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all loan 
types when a restructuring is involved. We may re-underwrite 
loans at the time of restructuring to determine whether there is 
sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity based on the 
borrower’s documented income, debt to income ratios, and other 
factors. Loans that are not re-underwritten or loans that lack 
sufficient evidence of sustained repayment capacity at the time 
of modification are charged down to the fair value of the 
collateral, if applicable. For an accruing loan that has been 
modified, if the borrower has demonstrated performance under 
the previous terms and the underwriting process shows the 
capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, 
the loan will generally remain in accruing status. Otherwise, the 
loan will be placed in nonaccrual status and may be returned to 
accruing status when the borrower demonstrates a sustained 
period of performance, generally six consecutive months of 
payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive payments made 
prior to modification. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual 
status, and a corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan 
balance, when we believe that principal and interest contractually 
due under the modified agreement will not be collectible. See 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
regarding TDRs.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 
Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to LHFS. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market terms qualify 
as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 
Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 
modification or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon, or otherwise resolved.

Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in 2022, 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

compared with 2021, was driven by lower losses in our 
commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage 
portfolios. 

The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in 2022, 
compared with 2021, was predominantly due to higher losses in 
our auto portfolio, driven by loans originated in 2021. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities in our residential mortgage portfolio instituted 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay 
the recognition of residential mortgage loan charge-offs. For 
additional information on customer accommodations in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other 
off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

al  
  nd  

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historic
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings a
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and 
Significant Accounting Policies
Report. For additional information on our ACL for loans, see

Includes negative allowance for expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 30 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans decreased $179 million, or 1%, from 
December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty around the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan 
portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by loan growth and a 
less favorable economic environment. The detail of the changes 
in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment (including charge-offs 
and recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 5 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base 
scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario 
and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans 
at December 31, 2022. The base scenario assumed elevated 
inflation and economic contraction in the near term, reflecting 
increased unemployment rates from historically low levels. The 
downside scenarios assumed a more substantial economic 
contraction due to high inflation, declining property values, and 
lower business and consumer confidence. 

Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent

We believe the ACL for loans of $13.6 billion at 

December 31, 2022, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total 
loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects 
existing factors as of the date of determination, including 
economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for 
loans to changes in the economic and business environment, 
it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for 
determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and 
commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA), who include the mortgage loans in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private 
label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In 
addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential 
mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed 
by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We 
may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify 
the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of 
the breach. 

In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 

mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase 
liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations 
and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for 
loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or 
not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of 
factors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest 
Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional 
information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase 
losses. 

We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage 
loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms 
of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual 
losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 (Guarantees 
and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information about our exposure to loss related to 
these programs. 

In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as 
servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial 
mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of 
FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label 
mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans 
owned by institutional investors. 

The loans we service were originated by us or by other 
mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance 
certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the 
mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or 
primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage 
loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of 

taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) 
foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent 
consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider 
alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short 
sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property 
through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of 
the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent 
amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform 
their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of 
reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by 
investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information about residential and 
commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. 
In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon 
transfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans 
from GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes 
exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid 
by the borrower. We generally repurchase these loans for cash 
and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. At 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, these repurchased loan balances 
were $9.8 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively, which included 
$8.6 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, in loans held for 
investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to transfer loans into the 
securitization market. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information about our involvement with mortgage 
loan securitizations. 

Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master 

servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify 
the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or 
master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, 
if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master 
servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not 
cured within a specified period. The standards governing 
servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible 
remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those 
standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides 
maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and 
individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs 
from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification 
or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in 
connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject 
to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and 
state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In 
general, these can require us to provide customers with loan 
modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention 
and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the 
imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on 
September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, 
risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its 
Home Lending business. For additional information on certain 
consent orders applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” 
section in this Report.

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. 

At the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability 
Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management 
from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and 
supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance 
Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in 
more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate 
management level oversight specific to market risk. 

• 	

• 	

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market 
fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange 
can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming 
from mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows 
primarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending 
and deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
•	
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, 
mortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate 
than anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

• 	

• 	

•	

•

•

Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 
across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 
Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the 
alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher 
yielding products could impact expected net interest 
income. 
The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the 
historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the 
expectations of deposit products repricing as market 
interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our 
actual experience in base and alternative scenarios may 
differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of 
deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other 
factors. 

• We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

In fourth quarter 2022, given the higher levels of interest rates and volatility, we presented 
100 bps shifts in our steeper and flatter scenarios. 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans 
and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 32, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as 
all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar 
interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the 
simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 32: 
•	
Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 
Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 

•

December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022, in Table 32 reflected 
updates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance 
sheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate 
sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher 
interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater 
degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest 
rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree 
than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. For the 
December 31, 2021, simulations with downward shifts in interest 
rates, the 0.00% interest rate floor limited the amount of the 
decline in net interest income. 

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage 
banking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in 
the opposite direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking 
Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for 
additional information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted 
by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits 
that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees

on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of 
related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In 
addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and 
noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by 
the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional 
information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in 
the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect 
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers 
the amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes 
unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt 
securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized 
into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact 
from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
•	
to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to 
fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 

•

In 2022, we entered into interest rate swap hedges to 

reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio. 
Additionally, we entered into interest rate swaps to convert the 
interest cash flows of some floating-rate assets, such as 
commercial loans and certain interest-earning deposits with 
banks, to fixed-rates. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate 
risk exposures are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity 
risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and 
other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or 
securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage 
loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of 
commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for 
investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability 
management activities. We may also retain securities in our 
investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. 

Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking 
noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and 
the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan 
commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage 
applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our 
mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to 
the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer 
demand, as well as the time required for processing a new 
application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and 
selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend 
on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest 
rates. 

The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly 
subjective and involve complex judgments by management 
about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in 

interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions 
captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including 
prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the 
servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow 
balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage 
Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional 
information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. 

An increase in interest rates generally reduces the 

propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the 
servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair 
value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also 
reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, 
which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A 
decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. 
To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our 
residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of 
derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar 
futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest 
rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in 
mortgage banking is a complex process that requires 
sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are 
several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking 
related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and 
associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of 
volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and 
changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to 
balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the 
financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the 
values and income being hedged. 

The size of the hedge and the particular combination of 
hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce 
the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a 
range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the 
composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the 
relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our 
mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types 
of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and 
rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and 
the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. 

For additional information on mortgage banking, including 

key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see 
Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and 
Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the 
trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans held at fair 
value, and impairment of private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s 
market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. 
In addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including 
counterparty risk. The Finance Committee reports key market 
risk matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight 
responsibility for market risk across the enterprise. The Market

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued)
 

and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into 
Corporate and Investment Banking Risk and provides periodic 
reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser 
extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held 
for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are 
monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated 
levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management 

Table 33:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

function aggregates and monitors exposures against our 
established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are 
analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors 
various market risk exposure measures from a variety of 
perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and 
legal entity. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 33 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation 
model which assumes that historical changes in market values 
are representative of the potential future outcomes and 
measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 
1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical 
simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 
12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 
12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is 
responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence 
level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur 
single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on 
average once every 100 trading days. 

Average Company Trading General VaR was $35 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $49 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average 
Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the year ended December 31, 2021, was 
primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition.

Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR 
models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity 
analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the 
measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% 
increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We 
conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, 
volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. 
Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication 
of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market 
moves. 

Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, 
stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to 
extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios 

estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions 
of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit 
spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These 
scenarios assume that the market moves happen 
instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes 
place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative 
approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). 

An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both 

historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad 
range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation 
and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the 
impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio 
values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase 
across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. 
Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress

scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis 
addresses how these events might affect the risk factors 
relevant to a portfolio. 

The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in 
calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal 
stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated 
to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail 
on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in 
this Report. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. These private equity 
investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board reviews business 
developments, key risks and historical returns for the private 
equity investment portfolio at least annually. Management 
reviews these investments at least quarterly to assess them for 
impairment and observable price changes. For nonmarketable 
equity securities, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances 
of each individual investment and the expectations for that 
investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the viability of its business 
model, our exit strategy, and observable price changes that are 
similar to the investments held. Investments in nonmarketable 
equity securities include private equity investments accounted 
for under the equity method, fair value through net income, and 
the measurement alternative. 

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by 
management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO 
and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these 
marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For 
additional information, see Note 4 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  Liquidity risk is the risk arising from 
the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they 
come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without 
incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we 
enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash 
payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. For additional information on these obligations, 
see the following sections and Notes to Financial Statements in 
this Report:

To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidit
guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cov
er  
potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence 
on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines ar
monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a 
quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established 
monitored for both the Company and the Parent on a stand
alone basis so that the Parent is a source of strength for its 
banking subsidiaries.

Liquidity Stress Tests  Liquidity stress tests are performed to 
help ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet 
contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of 
stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as 
corporate-specific events, including a range of stress conditions 
and time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of 
the Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and 
inform future needs in the Company’s funding plan. 

Contingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP), 
which is approved by Corporate ALCO and the Board’s Risk 
Committee, sets out the Company’s strategies and action plans 
to address potential liquidity needs during market-wide or 
idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP establishes measures for 
monitoring emerging liquidity events and describes the 
processes for communicating and managing stress events should 
they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate funding and liquidity 
strategies available to the Company in a period of stress. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold 
high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists 
of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and 
mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies 
to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) 
with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued 
by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as 
Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies 
to the Company and to our IDIs with total assets of $10 billion or 
more. As of December 31, 2022, we were compliant with the 
NSFR requirement.

Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule. 
Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and 
unfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors including the type of customer and the nature of the account. 

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, 
interest-earning deposits with banks, and unencumbered high-
quality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary 
sources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are 
substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR 
rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 
exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. Our primary sources 
of liquidity are presented in Table 35 at fair value, which also 
includes encumbered securities that are not included as available 
HQLA in the calculation of the LCR. 

Table 35:  Primary Sources of Liquidity 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary source
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
in  
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obta
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 35, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt securities 
as well as through the sale, securitization or financing of loans, to 
the extent such debt securities and loans are not encumbered. 

Funding Sources  The Parent acts as a source of funding for the 
Company through the issuance of long-term debt and equity. 
WFC Holdings, LLC (the “IHC”) is an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent, which provides funding 
support for the ongoing operational requirements of the Parent 
and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For additional 
information on the IHC, see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living 
Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this Report. 
Additional subsidiary funding is provided by deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 145% and 166% of total 
loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 

$209.0 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal 
Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. 
Although available, we do not view the borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Reserve Discount Window as a primary source of 
liquidity. Table 36 presents a summary of our short-term 
borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. For 
additional information on the classification of our short-term 
borrowings, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. We pledge 
certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of Note 
18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies 
with regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2022.

Capital Management

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
December 31, 2022, increased $7.3 billion from December 31, 
2021, predominantly as a result of $13.2 billion of Wells Fargo 
net income, partially offset by $5.4 billion of common and 
preferred stock dividends. During 2022, we issued $1.8 billion of 
common stock, substantially all of which was issued in 
connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2022, 
we repurchased 110 million shares of common stock at a cost of 
$6 billion. In 2022, our AOCI decreased $11.7 billion, 
predominantly due to net unrealized losses on AFS debt 
securities. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of 
AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the 
amount of our risk-based capital. For additional information 
about capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress 
Testing” section below. 

In 2022, we redeemed $609 million of preferred stock. For 

additional information, see Note 11 (Preferred Stock) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, 
and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both 
approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 39 and 
Table 40 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable 
to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced 
Approach, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. 

Table 39:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach 
as of December 31, 2022 

Table 40:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach as of 
December 31, 2022 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 39 and Table 40, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, 
2022, was 0.00%. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress.

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is 
3.20%. 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also 

subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital 
surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually 
calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher 
of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers 
our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 

 BCBS  and the Financial Stability 

Table 41:  Capital Components and Ratios 

wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If 
our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our 
annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our 
G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Table 41 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, total 
capital, RWAs and capital ratios.

Capital Management (continued)
 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in 
consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred 
taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, 
which represents tangible common equity divided by common 
shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of 
determining tangible common equity may differ among 
companies. Management believes that tangible book value per 
common share and return on average tangible common equity, 
which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial 
measures because they enable management, investors, and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 46 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio. 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
. 
December 31, 2022

 Table 47 

 presents the 

Table 47: 

  Leverage Requirements Applica

ble to

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least  6.00%  to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum Tier 
leverage ratio of 

 4.00%. 

 1  

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 

rules (Proposed SLR rules) that would replace the 2.00% 
supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half o
our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR rules would 
similarly tailor the current 6.00% SLR requirement for our IDIs

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
December 31, 2022, are presented in Table 49.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo 

Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are 
subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital 
requirements. As of December 31, 2022, these broker-dealer 
subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory 
minimum net capital requirements. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
-
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and gro
w  
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varyin
g  
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to retur
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed ca
requirements,  including the G-SIB capital surcharge 
 and the 
stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulato
requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, 
changes in our risk profile and other factors
. Accordingly, our 
long-term target capital levels are set above their respective 
regulatory minimums plus buffers.

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

As part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB 
reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all 
large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital 
actions. 

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the 
institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights 
the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight 
initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For 
additional information about the regulatory matters discussed 
below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, 
see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2022 Form 
10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 25 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform 
legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional 
information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its 
rulemaking initiatives. 
•	

Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important 
firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal 
banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and 
regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. 
The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing 
enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based 
capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single 
counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity 
limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave 
threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB 
and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress 
testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In 
addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish 
remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress. Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety 
and soundness and the financial and operational resilience of 
its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance regarding 
effective boards of directors of large BHCs and has proposed 
related guidance identifying core principles for effective 
senior management. The OCC, under separate authority, has 
finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance and 
risk management standards for large national banks such as 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require covered 
banks to establish and adhere to a written risk governance 
framework to manage and control their risk-taking 
activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and 
responsibilities for risk management practices within 
covered banks and create certain risk oversight 
responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to 

amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At December 31, 2022, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 250 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during fourth quarter 2022, see Part II, Item 5 
in our 2022 Form 10-K.

•	

the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory 
requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-
Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may 
recommend new systemic risk management requirements 
and require new reporting of systemic risks. 
Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank 
Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate 
disclosures regarding financial products and are protected 
from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has 
issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial 
products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, 
notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect 
to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting 
prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and 
banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking 
activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory 
examination activities of the financial services industry with 
respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, 
including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending 
requirements, and auto finance. 
Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The 
Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for 
regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to 
authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive 
sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, 
respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared 
swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally-
registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered 
security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is 
subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted 
or under consideration by regulators in the United States 
and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer 
demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability 
to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to 
existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging 
in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives 
activities. 

Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules 
issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-
based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
, to 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo
prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known a
  s  
“living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failu
Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a 
reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the 
U.S.  Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable 
period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates th
  e  
risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the 
financial stability of the United States. In addition to the 
Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, 
e  
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepar
and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FD
IC  
determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requiremen
on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until w
  e  
adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any 
deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets o
operations. On November 23, 2022, the FRB and FDIC 
announced that the Company’s most recent resolution plan did 
not have any shortcomings or deficiencies. 

  r  

ts  

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 
important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 
default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation 
authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would 
determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and 
obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation 
authority requires that security holders of a company in 
receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to 
any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of 
creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the 
strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims 
procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ 
claims. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the 
only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 

desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an 
orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 
2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended 
and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with 
WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and 
subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo 
Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC 
(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated 
from time to time as material entities for resolution planning 
purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time 
as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related 
Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including 
the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and 
intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its 
subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will 
continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time 
to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, 
the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide 
capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered 
Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support 
Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the 
Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of 
credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected 
to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating 
conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its 
debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other 
obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these 
arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ 
or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s 
board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the 
committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to 
pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which 
could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and 
its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could 
result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the 
Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if 
the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective 
obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, 
the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant 
to a related security agreement. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a 
range of options that we may consider during times of 
idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial 
weaknesses and restore market confidence without 
extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the 
possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan 
portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and

• 

Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change. 
Federal and state governments and government agencies 
have demonstrated increased attention to the impacts and 
potential risks associated with climate change. For example, 
federal banking regulators are reviewing the implications of 
climate change on the financial stability of the United States 
and the identification and management by large banks of 
climate-related financial risks. In addition, the SEC has 
proposed rules that would require public companies to 
disclose certain climate-related information, including 
greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related targets and 
goals, and governance of climate-related risks and relevant 
risk management processes. The approaches taken by 
various governments and government agencies can vary 
significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any 
current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to 
climate change and its impacts could require us to change 
certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and 
earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise 
adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position. 

Regulatory Matters (continued)
 

periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth 
Bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is 
experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but 
not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resoluti
is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our 
recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restriction
our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.

  In response 

Regulatory Developments Related to COVID-19. 
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal 
banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help 
stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, 
and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like 
Wells Fargo to continue lending to consumers and 
businesses.  In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued 
guidelines for banks and BHCs related to working with 
customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
guidance with respect to waiving fees, offering repayment 
accommodations, and providing payment deferrals. Any 
current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts could require us to 
change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue 
and earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise 
adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
•

•	
•	
•	
•	

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which 
is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the 
loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance 
sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments 
carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an 
ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other 
financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in 
leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For 
additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a 
discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the 
judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the 
initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to 
time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business 
strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment 
strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in 
our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL 
to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security 
portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and 
consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of 
the Company. 

•	

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast 
period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to 
estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables 
include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, 

and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic 
variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some 
economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, 
for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for 
unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real 
estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the 
initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period 
to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast 
multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base 
scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises 
judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios 
that are used to estimate future credit losses. 
Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term 
average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the 
long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the 
forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages 
are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. 
The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is 
assessed on a quarterly basis. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually 
assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit 
variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower 
quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial 
strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default 
curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted 
collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted 
severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk 
ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers 
and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk 
specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. 
Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in 
the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and 
variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are 
independently validated in accordance with the Company’s 
policies. We routinely assess our model performance and 
apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy 
of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations 
against the company-wide risk inventory to help 
appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our 
estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as 
needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial 
asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply 
judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases 
in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative 
allowance when the financial asset has been previously 
written-down below current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We 
extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension

 Credit card loans have

reasonably expect to provide an extension through a 
troubled debt restructuring (TDR). 
indeterminate maturities, which requires that we determine 
a contractual life by estimating the application of future 
payments to the outstanding loan amount. 
Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions 
used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity   The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant management judgment. 
Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety 
 of  
ty,  
factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quali
and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted 
t  
economic variables used could have varying impacts on differen
financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numero
us  
s  
credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variable
such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices whic
may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in 
opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. 

h  

Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s 

view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We 
applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our 
sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic 
deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the 
duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables 
within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a 
hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately 
$7.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The hypothetical increase in 
our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of 
management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the 
current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative 
effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar 
sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities 

and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall 
ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for 
loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. 

Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 
(MSRs) 
MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing 
rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we 
originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from 
third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-
issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were 
originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. 

We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans 
at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the 
economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are 
reflected in earnings. 

We use a model to estimate the fair value of our 
residential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with 
Company policies by an internal model validation group. The 
model calculates the present value of estimated future net 
servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions 
that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain 
significant inputs and assumptions generally are not 
observable in the market and require judgment to determine. 

If observable market indications do become available, these 
are factored into the estimates as appropriate: 
•	

The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future 
net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate 
at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage 
loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower 
defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and 
borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in 
mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. 
The discount rate used to present value estimated future net 
servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of 
return investors in the market would expect for an asset 
with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider 
the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates 
such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in 
future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on 
escrow accounts). In 2022, we enhanced our approach for 
estimating the discount rate to a more dynamic 
methodology for market curves and volatility. 
The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net 
servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes 
estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency 
and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of 
defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service 
loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market 
participant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our 
actual costs may vary from that estimate. 

•	

•	

Both prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, 

and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and 
mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in 
either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results 
in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in 
either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of 
the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-
driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount 
rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the 
future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in 
servicing standards as well as changes in individual state 
foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant 
information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an 
impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation 
in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value 
estimate to independent appraisals. 

For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, 

see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 
(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest 
Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a 
financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value 
adjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair 
value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities 
held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS 
debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are 
carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, 
such as certain LHFS, substantially all nonmarketable equity 
securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair 
value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value 
adjustments through the application of an accounting method

such as lower-of-cost-or-fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of 
individual assets, or application of the measurement alternative 
for certain nonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our 
estimate of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair 
value, such as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, 
and long-term debt. 

The accounting requirements for fair value measurements 

include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and 
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used for measurement are 
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-
derived or market-based information obtained from 
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our 
estimates about market data. 

When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the 

use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to 
measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not 
available, fair value measurement is based upon models that 
generally use market-based or independently sourced market 
parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment 
rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when 
observable market data is limited or not available, fair value 
estimates are typically determined using internal models based 
on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair 
value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an 
internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party 
pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either 
record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal 
prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed 
over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. 

When using internal models based on unobservable inputs, 

management judgment is necessary as we make judgments 
about significant assumptions that market participants would 
use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions 
includes consideration of many factors, including market 
conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, 
such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in 
secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and 
reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine 
fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available 
quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may 
adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using 
internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact 
of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair 
value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and 
certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs 
have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-
party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model 
uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market 
participant would require in light of the illiquid market. 

We continually assess the level and volume of market 
activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining 
adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions 
can change over time, our determination of which securities 
markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we 
determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted 
prices require adjustment, can also change. 

Significant judgment is also applied in the determination of 

whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this 
judgment, we consider available information, including 
observable market data, indications of market liquidity and 
orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques 

and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The 
classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts 
and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category 
and judgments are made regarding the significance of 
unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are 
considered significant to the fair value measurement, the 
instrument is classified as Level 3. 

Table 51 presents our (1) assets and liabilities recorded at 
fair value on a recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities 
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a

Income Taxes 
We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we 
operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: 
current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax 
expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded 
for the current period and includes income tax expense related to 
uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that 
management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of 
realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our 
realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet 
method and deferred income tax expense results from changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the 
balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is 
based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and 
tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes 
in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred 
tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment 
that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance 
reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. 

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

are complex and subject to different interpretations by 
management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In 
establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make 
judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax 
laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future 
certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax 
jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review 
during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise

over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these 
disputes during the tax examination and audit process and 
ultimately through the court systems when applicable. 

We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate 

of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and 
their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a 
quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income 
taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from 
the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our 
estimates may be material to our operating results for any given 
quarter. 

See Note 22 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes 
and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses 
The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, 
governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or 
investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its 
business activities, and many of those proceedings and 
investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or 
other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal 
actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For 
such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best 
estimate within a range of potential losses that are both 
probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best 
estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those 
potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may 
be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for 
those actions. 

We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for 

potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing 
the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. 
Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of 
reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for 
probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding 
of information currently available related to the legal evaluation 
and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on 
these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and 
senior management. These matters may be in various stages of 
investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a 
wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and 
jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was 
not considered or was considered remote in anticipated 
occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will 
change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject 

to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to 
determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also 
inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there 
may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably 
possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses 
may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of 
reasonably possible loss. 

See Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for additional information. 

Goodwill Impairment 
We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter 
more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors 
warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long
-
term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue 
generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by 

 or  

regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in 
market capitalization. 

We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill 

impairment at the reportable operating segment level or one 
level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as 
allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible 
assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-
sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital 
requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units 
based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using 
both an income approach and a market approach which are 
intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as 
well as external market conditions. The methodologies for 
calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are 
periodically assessed by senior management and revised as 
necessary. 

The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) 
analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows 
associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires 
significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our 
reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic 
conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations 
related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed 
by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, 
we incorporate a terminal value estimate based on an assumed 
long-term growth rate. We discount these forecasted cash flows 
using a consistent rate derived from the capital asset pricing 
model which produces an estimated cost of equity for our 
reporting units, which reflects risks and uncertainties in the 
financial markets and in our internally generated business 
projections. 

The market approach utilizes observable market data from 

comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings 
or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting 
unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a 
control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical 
acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in 
the selection of comparable companies and includes those with 
the most similar business activities. 

The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our 

market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2022 assessment. 
Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to 
this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid 
to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the 
Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in 
the price of the Company’s common stock, and (iii) risks or 
benefits at the Company level that may not be reflected in the 
aggregated fair value of the individual reporting units, such as 
the impacts of a variety of historical matters, including litigation, 
regulatory, and customer remediation matters. 

Based on our fourth quarter 2022 assessment, there was no 
impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2022. The fair values of 
each reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by 
substantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer 
Lending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer 
Lending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more 
than 10%, it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation 
assumptions, particularly related to the financial forecasts of 
the supporting businesses. The home lending business may 
experience uncertainty related to the current mortgage 
origination market and the outcome of planned changes to the 
business model. The credit card business has forecasted higher 
loan balances driven by growth from new products. Adverse 
changes to these forecasts may result in an impairment. Using 
our fourth quarter 2022 assessment, we would need to

experience a substantial decrease in forecasted earnings of the 
Consumer Lending reporting unit or have a significant increase 
in the discount rate used for the DCF analysis to result in an 
impairment. The amount of goodwill assigned to the Consumer 
Lending reporting unit was $7.1 billion at December 31, 2022. 
Declines in our ability to generate revenue, significant 
increases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions 

from regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill 
impairment of any reporting unit in a future period.

operating segments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other 
Assets), and Note 19 (Operating Segments) to Financial

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 52 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective.

Financial statement impact 

We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023, with retroactive application to prior periods. The most 
significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of 
our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These variable 
annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for 
the remainder of the policyholder’s life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed 
minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and are measured at fair value. 

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944):

Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates

The Update, effective January 1, 2023, 
requires market risk benefits (features 
of insurance contracts that protect the 
policyholder from other-than-nominal 
capital market risk and expose the 
insurer to that risk) to be measured at 
fair value through earnings with changes 
in fair value attributable to our own 
credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. The Update also 
requires more frequent updates for 
insurance assumptions, mandates the 
use of a standardized discount rate for 
traditional long-duration contracts, and 
simplifies the amortization of deferred 
acquisition costs. 

At adoption, the effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of our market risk 
benefits, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, was 
approximately $325 million as of January 1, 2023. The adjustment increased our retained earnings and 
regulatory capital amounts and ratios. The adjustment for the impact of our own credit risk recorded as 
an increase to other comprehensive income was approximately $15 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 
2023. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which 
are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes 
in mortality assumptions. We economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible. 

Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-duration contracts 
and deferred acquisition costs did not have a material impact upon adoption. 

ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method 

The Update, effective January 1, 2023 
(with early adoption permitted), 
establishes the portfolio layer method, 
which expands an entity’s ability to 
achieve fair value hedge accounting for 
interest rate risk hedges of closed 
portfolios of financial assets. The Update 
also provides guidance on the 
accounting for hedged item basis 
adjustments under the portfolio layer 
method. 

We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023 on a prospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to 
the opening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon adoption, as impacts to us were reflected 
prospectively. The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
associated with portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and 
loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number 
and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged 
items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets. 

Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. 
Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to 
available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge 
no later than 30 days after the adoption date. 

In January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities with an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion 
and amortized cost of $23.9 billion from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale and designated interest 
rate swaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method. 
The transfer of debt securities was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately $566 million of 
unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale debt securities being recorded to other 
comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes.

Financial statement impact 

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 
The Update, effective January 1, 2023 
(with early adoption permitted), 
eliminates the accounting and reporting 
for TDRs by creditors and introduces 
new required disclosures for loan 
modifications made to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty. The 
Update also amends the guidance for 
vintage disclosures to require disclosure 
of current period gross charge-offs by 
year of origination. 

Eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the ACL for 
TDRs and instead allows for the use of an expected loss approach for all loans. On January 1, 2023, 
we removed the interest concession component recognized in the ACL for TDRs using a DCF 
approach. The cumulative effect adjustment reflected the difference between the pre-modification 
and post-modification effective interest rates, which would have been recognized over the 
remaining life of the loans as interest income. The adjustment was a reduction to the ACL for loans 
of approximately $430 million, and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $320 million, 
after-tax. This adjustment to retained earnings impacts regulatory capital amounts and ratios. 

We adopted the Update on January 1, 2023. The Update will impact the measurement of the ACL for 
loans and require new enhanced disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality, specifically 
the Update: 
•	

•	

•	

Eliminates TDR disclosures and requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other 
than insignificant payment delay, term extension, or a combination of these modifications. 

Requires us to provide current period gross charge-offs by origination date (vintage) in our credit 
quality disclosures on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date.

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial

changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our act
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is com
important factors that could cause actual results to differ

Forward-Looking Statements (continued)
 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company, 
and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 

actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refe
r to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
  s  
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this Report, a
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and availabl
on its website at

. From time to 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or target
s  
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty i
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to fut
results. 

  n  

ure  

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law.

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company.

generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the 
loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantia
l  
amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest 
income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and 
commercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses 
have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the 
state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels an
home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty 
stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, 
including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, ta
  xes  
and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impac
the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including 
flict  
international political unrest or disturbances, such as the con
in Ukraine, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices
,  
restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliato
ry  
measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the 
stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any 
impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to th
U.S.  economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global

t  

A weakening in business or economic conditions, including 
higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as 
higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ 
ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can 
negatively impact our credit performance. If unemployment 
levels worsen or if home prices fall we would expect to incur 
elevated charge-offs and provision expense from increases in our 
allowance for credit losses. These conditions may adversely 
affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial 
and CRE loans, especially for those business borrowers that rely 
on the health of industries that may experience deteriorating 
economic conditions. The ability of these and other borrowers to 
repay their loans may deteriorate, causing us, as one of the 
largest commercial and CRE lenders in the U.S., to incur 
significantly higher credit losses. In addition, weak or 
deteriorating economic conditions make it more challenging for 
us to increase our consumer and commercial loan portfolios by 
making loans to creditworthy borrowers at attractive yields. 
Furthermore, weak economic conditions, as well as competition 
and/or increases in interest rates, could soften demand for our 
loans resulting in our retaining a much higher amount of lower 
yielding liquid assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If 

economic conditions do not continue to improve or if the 
economy worsens and unemployment rises, which also would 
likely result in a decrease in consumer and business confidence 
and spending, the demand for our products, including our 
consumer and commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest 
and noninterest income and our earnings. 

A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which 

may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our 
investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, 
markets and investment banking businesses. For example, 
because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of 
assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those 
assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market 
prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing 
commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage 
business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively 
affect the performance of products we have provided to 
customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional 
costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial 
markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture 
capital business and trading activities, including through 
heightened counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global 
financial markets and economies, including as a result of any 
international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely 
affect the revenue and earnings of our international operations, 
particularly our global financial institution and correspondent 
banking services.

Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” 
sections in this Report. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business 
and financial results and any further impact will depend on 
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted.  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the 
global economy; disrupted global supply chains; affected equity 
market valuations; and created significant volatility and 
disruption in financial markets and unemployment levels. As a 
result of the pandemic, the demand for our products and services 
has, at times, been significantly impacted, which adversely 
affected our revenue. The pandemic also resulted in the 
recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in 
our allowance for credit losses, particularly for industries most 
directly and adversely affected by the pandemic, such as travel 
and entertainment. 

Moreover, the pandemic created additional operational and 

compliance risks, including the need to quickly implement and 
execute new pandemic-related programs and procedures, 
comply with rapidly changing regulatory requirements, address 
any increased risk of fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity 
and functionality of our systems, networks, and operations while 
a larger number of our employees and those of our third-party 
service providers may spend more time working remotely than 
prior to the pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we 
previously suspended certain mortgage foreclosure activities and 
provided fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other assistance for 
certain consumer and commercial lending customers. 
Furthermore, our participation in governmental measures taken 
to address the economic impact from the pandemic could

Risk Factors (continued)
 

continue to result in litigation and government investigations 
and proceedings. In addition, we previously reduced our common 
stock dividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases. 
The pandemic also increased the likelihood and/or magnitude of 
the other risks described herein, including credit, market and 
operational related risks. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further 
impacts our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, 
depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and 
cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the 
pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and 
other third parties in response to the pandemic. Depending on 
future developments, the COVID-19 pandemic or any new 
pandemic could result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated 
adverse effects on us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar 
to those already experienced. 

Changes in interest rates and financial market values could 
reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our 
other comprehensive income, including as a result of 
recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we 
hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Changes in 
either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning 
assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the 
February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net 
interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can 
affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our 
assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction 
in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster 
than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or 
contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on 
our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than 
our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract. 

The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect 
our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the 
form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. 
As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower 
demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield 
and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and 
net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged 
period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower 
yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, 
particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher 
yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in 
interest rates, however, may continue to negatively affect loan 
demand and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may 
have more difficulty making higher interest payments. As 
described below, changes in interest rates also affect our 
mortgage business, including the value of our MSRs. In an effort 
to address high inflation, the FRB significantly raised its target 
range for the federal funds rate and has indicated it may continue 
to raise it in 2023. 

Changes in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread 
between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also 
reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. 
Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term 
rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve 
flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest 
margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding 
increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term 
assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which 
interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest 
income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the 

interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while 
also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with 
the FRB. 

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on 

our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on 
assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may 
hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate 
derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our 
mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as 
their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based 
on changes in interest rates. 

We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There 
is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or 
option volatility could reduce our net interest income and 
earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material 
amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially 
different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates 
rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve 
changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we 
hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may 
rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and 
loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We 
may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes 
in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could 
limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities.

Because of changing economic and market conditions, as 
well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance o
  f  
any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize othe
than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the 
securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securiti
we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer 
creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is 
exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection 
with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to 
accommodate the investment and risk management activities of 
our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities an
  d  
equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value wi
th  
realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninteres
income. As part of our business to support our customers, we 
trade public debt and equity securities and other financial 
instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with gains 
h  
and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although hig
market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-related 
losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse effect o
businesses as a result of reduced customer activity levels. 
Although we have processes in place to measure and monitor the 
risks associated with our trading activities, including stress 
testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance that

The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity 
securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable 
equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and 
losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are 
carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement 
alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized 
gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity 
securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may 
have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. 
When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of 
factors, including general economic and market conditions, the

Nonmarketable equity securities include our private equity 
and venture capital investments that could result in significant 
OTTI losses for those investments carried under the 
measurement alternative or equity method. If we determine 
there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying 
value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings, which 
could be significant. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk”, “– Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk”, “– Market Risk – Trading 
Activities”, and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the 
“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-

Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  The administrator of LIBOR 
ceased publication of LIBOR settings on a representative basis on 
December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly 
used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, which will no longer be 
published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. 
Additionally, federal banking regulators issued guidance strongly 
encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR in 
new contracts. We have a significant number of assets and 
liabilities, such as legacy commercial loans, adjustable-rate 
mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt, 
referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. When 
any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is 
significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be 
recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial 
metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation 
of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on 
the terms of the governing instrument. 

This could impact the financial performance of previously 
booked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we 
hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective 
or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall 
interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating-
rate funding, affect our capital and liquidity planning and 
management, or have other adverse financial consequences. 
There can be no assurance that any new benchmark rate, such as 
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or other financial 
metric will be an adequate alternative to LIBOR or produce the 
economic equivalent of LIBOR. In addition, the transition away 
from LIBOR will continue to require changes to existing 
transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, and 
pricing processes, as well as the modification or renegotiation of 
contracts that reference USD LIBOR. It may also continue to 
result in significant operational, systems, or other practical 
challenges, increased compliance and operational costs, and 
heightened expectations and scrutiny from regulators, and could 
result in litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse 
consequences. Furthermore, the transition away from widely 
used benchmark rates like LIBOR could result in customers or 
other market participants challenging the determination of their 
interest payments, disputing the interpretation or 
implementation of fallback provisions and other transition 
related changes, or entering into fewer transactions or 
postponing their financing needs, which could reduce our 
revenue and adversely affect our business. Moreover, to the 

extent borrowers with loans referenced to LIBOR, such as 
adjustable-rate mortgage loans, experience higher interest 
payments as a result of the transition to a new benchmark rate, 
our customers’ ability to repay their loans may be adversely 
affected, which can negatively impact our credit performance. 

For additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR 
and the steps we are taking to address and mitigate the risks we 
have identified, see the “Overview – Recent Developments – 
LIBOR Transition” section in this Report. 

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation 
of our business, and our financial results and condition could be 
materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage 
our liquidity.  We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a 
low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and 
the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, 
our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, 
our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to 
pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the 
FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and 
international money through capital markets. 

Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our 
inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market 
disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which 
are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury 
securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity 
that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in 
interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase 
our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could 
materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack 
of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative 
news about the Company or the financial services industry 
generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or 
negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our 
inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or 
volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our 
short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or 
restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on 
lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more 
of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors 
may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. 
There can be no assurance that significant disruption and 
volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For 
example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and 
currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause 
financial market volatility. 

In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, 

including any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any 
associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may 
cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the 
sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt 
ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as 
well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing 
economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely 
affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that 
we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for 
borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable 
terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the 
operation of our business and our financial results and condition.

Risk Factors (continued)
 

As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our 
funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial 
services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the 
rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either 
because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we 
lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of 
funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms 
of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive 
other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money 
market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. 
When customers move money out of bank deposits and into 
other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of 
funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our 
liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit 
balances in order to manage under the asset cap. 

If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through 
customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms 
e fail 
or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwis
 or  
to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intra-day 
intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, fin
ancial  
results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As 
did during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be requir
our regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuanc
common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock 
dividend to preserve capital or to raise additional capital.

Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. 

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material 
adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and 
condition.  Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are 
influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our 
credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds 
and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could 
cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral 
requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect 
our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings 
agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of 
many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital 
adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and 
quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, 
and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit 
ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other 
external factors, including market volatility and concerns or 
perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There 
can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and 
outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would 
not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing 
costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger 
additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on 
the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse 
effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related 
contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. 

For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk 

Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and 
Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and 
federal and state law, as well as certain contractual 
arrangements, can limit those dividends.  Wells Fargo & 
Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a 
separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives 
substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and 
other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these 
dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends 
on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on 
our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends 
and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank 
subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to 
the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated 
June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, 
among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo 
Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the 
Parent designated from time to time as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as 
related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be 
restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if 
certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers 
or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to participate in a 
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or 
reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s 
creditors. 

For additional information, see the “Regulation and 
Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company 
Structure” sections in our 2022 Form 10-K and to Note 25 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

REGULATORY RISKS 

Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require 
us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our 
revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or 
otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or 
competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary 
banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those 
related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and 
extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as 
well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of 
the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations 
generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, 
consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial 
system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. 
Economic, market and political conditions during the past few 
years have led to a significant amount of legislation and 
regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services 
industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of 
financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws 
and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we 
do business and the products and services that we provide, affect 
or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our 
ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our 
revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, 
increase our capital requirements, impose additional fees, 
assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision 
of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our 
business operations or have other negative consequences. Our 
businesses and revenue in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject 
to risks from political, economic and social developments in

those jurisdictions, including sanctions or business restrictions, 
asset freezes or confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic 
developments, or financial or social instability. In addition, 
greater government oversight and scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as 
well as financial services companies generally, has increased our 
operational and compliance costs as we must continue to devote 
substantial resources to enhancing our procedures and controls 
and meeting heightened regulatory standards and expectations. 
Any failure to meet regulatory requirements, standards or 
expectations, either in the U.S. or in non-U.S. jurisdictions, could 
continue to result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our 
ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse 
consequences. 

Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, 

credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending 
businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly 
complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as 
enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory 
examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s 
rules may continue to increase our compliance costs and require 
changes in our business practices, which could limit or negatively 
affect the products and services that we offer our customers. If 
we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and 
expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may 
be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our 
business activities including the products and services we can 
provide, and/or harm to our reputation. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a 

comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter 
derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based 
swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to 
negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter 
derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives 
or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for 
engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives 
activities. 

We are also subject to various rules and regulations related 
to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, 
including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and 
regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies 
and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery 
and corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, 
currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. 
Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply 
with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully 
effective or do not meet heightened regulatory standards or 
expectations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions 
on certain activities, reputational harm, or other adverse 
consequences. 

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations 
enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental 
authorities relating to the privacy of the information of 
customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, 
among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a 
significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, 
sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data 
breaches; and provide for significantly increased penalties for 
non-compliance. 

In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders 
and other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent 
order with the FRB regarding the Board’s governance and 
oversight of the Company, and the Company’s compliance and 
operational risk management program. This consent order limits 
the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the 

consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain 
conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely 
affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also 
subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate 
lock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 
consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in 
the Company’s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject 
to a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding 
multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer 
deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. 

Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank 
remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in 
November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain 
non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors 
and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain 
regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain 
individuals and employees. 

The Company may be subject to further actions, including 

the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory 
agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators 
regarding similar or other issues. Furthermore, issues or delays in 
satisfying the requirements of a regulatory action could affect 
our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of 
a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional 
penalties, enforcement actions, and other negative 
consequences, which could be significant. For example, in 
September 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money 
penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in 
addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent 
order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home 
Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB 
consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the 
September 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB 
consent order, and any other consent orders or regulatory 
actions, as well as the implementation of their requirements, may 
continue to increase the Company’s costs, require the Company 
to reallocate resources away from growing its existing 
businesses, subject the Company to business restrictions, 
negatively impact the Company’s capital and liquidity, and 
require the Company to undergo significant changes to its 
business, operations, products and services, and risk 
management practices. For additional information on the 
Company’s consent orders, see the “Overview” section in this 
Report. 

Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly 

affect our business include proposals to reform the housing 
finance market in the United States. These proposals, among 
other things, consider ending the conservatorships of the GSEs 
and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in 
buying mortgage loans or guaranteeing mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS), as well as the implementation of reforms 
relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage 
market. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the 
adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home 
mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company’s 
business and financial results, are uncertain. 

Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, 
also could significantly change our regulatory environment and 
increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may 
pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings 
associations, credit unions, and other financial services

companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results and condition. 

For additional information on the significant regulations and 
regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect 
our business, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report 
and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2022 Form 
10-K. 

We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities 
or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or 
recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB 
and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits 
resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate 
our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial 
distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or 
FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. 
If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has 
deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or 
operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the 
FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable 
to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain 
assets or operations. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a 
range of options that we may consider during times of 
idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any 
financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without 
extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare 
and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the 
FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, 
they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately 
require us to divest assets. 

Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of

Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full.

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the 
FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires 
that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses 
before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are 
substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the 
orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of 
creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain 
circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure 
instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the 
only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. 
To facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we 
entered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC 
and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. 
In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC 
will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital 
and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect 
subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the 
IHC will provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through 
subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain 

liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if 
the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be 
forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the 
IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, 
any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s 
liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, 
and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy 
proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have 
otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not 
implemented. 

t’s  
s  

Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on 
  e  
shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of th
Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate
.  
Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive 
significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Paren
security holders could face significant or complete losses. Thi
outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the 
U.S.  Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly 
liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted 
using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple poin
entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its 
subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution 
proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multipl
point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiar
could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s 
security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy prove
to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater los
than if the strategy had not been implemented.

Report. 

Bank regulations and rules may require higher capital and 
liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock 
dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our 
business, or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository 
institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In 
particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal 
banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital 
requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, 
among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating 
capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal 
banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a 
supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and 
our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized 
rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and 
resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 
(TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final 
rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable 
funding ratio. 

In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced 
capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms 
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital 
plan rule that establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations 
implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs 
like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk 
and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and

imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators 
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the 
United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules 
implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and 
national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to 
establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress and has proposed additional requirements 
regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, 
including its expectations for boards of directors and senior 
management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also 
established heightened governance and risk management 
standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. 

The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, 

liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may 
limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including 
common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require 
us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that 
we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or 
liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, 
such as through the adoption or implementation of new or 
revised Basel standards, or as a result of business growth, 
acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to 
liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product 
offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect 
our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, new 
capital requirements and/or our regulators may require us to 
raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common 
stock may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In 
addition, federal banking regulations may continue to increase 
our compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our 
business or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers. 

For additional information, see the “Capital Management,” 

“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk 
and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” 
sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” 
section in our 2022 Form 10-K. 

FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can 
significantly affect business and economic conditions and our 
financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of 
money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part 
our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we 
earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our 
net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest 
rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial 
instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In 
addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially 
increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. 
Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal 
funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its 
balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. 
The FRB significantly raised its target range for the federal funds 
rate and has indicated it may continue to raise it in 2023 to 
address high inflation. As noted above, changes in the interest 
rate environment and yield curve which may result from the 
FRB’s actions could negatively affect our net interest income and 
net interest margin. 

CREDIT RISKS 

Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in 
economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could 
require us to increase our provision for credit losses and 
allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse 

effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit 
risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. 
As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance 
of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results 
and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading 
and other activities. As noted above, if the current economic 
environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and 
counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or 
other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit 
losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses 
by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The 
amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of credit 
losses inherent in our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit 
commitments). The process for determining the amount of the 
allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It 
requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the 
future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that 
might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We 
might increase the allowance because of changing economic 
conditions, including falling home prices, higher unemployment 
or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in consumer 
behavior, or other market conditions that adversely affect 
borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory 
environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, 
disease pandemics, political or social matters, or trade policies, 
also can influence recognition of credit losses in our loan 
portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses. 

Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses 
was appropriate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance 
that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event 
of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we 
experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build 
reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. 
For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. 

We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the 
extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry 
segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or 
collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our 
loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or 
similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group 
may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 
market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market 
conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or 
geography may also impact related or dependent industries or 
the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in 
such industries to meet their financial obligations. We 
experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 
when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential 
real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater 
than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in 
many markets, including the Central Valley California market and 
several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As 
California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and 
deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying 
economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California 
could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes 
in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely 
affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may

Risk Factors (continued)
 

increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these 
borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration 
in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could 
result in materially higher credit losses, including for our 
residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes 
nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. 
We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as 
our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their 
contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. 

We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. 
A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects 
the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including 
increases in interest rates, declines in commercial property 
values, and/or changes in consumer behavior or other market 
conditions, such as a continued decrease in the demand for office 
space, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a 
material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 

Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions 

may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material 
adverse effect on our credit performance and results of 
operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively 
affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. 
operations. 

Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain 

derivative transactions through central counterparty 
clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to thes
CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we 
may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the 
CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults 
 non-
on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of 
performance by our clients for which we clear transactions 
through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not 
sufficiently covered by available collateral.

OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC AND LEGAL RISKS 

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, 
controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors 
and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, 
damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. 
As a large financial institution that serves customers through 
numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking 
and other distribution channels across the U.S. and 
internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and 
monitor a large number of customer transactions on a 
continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have 
expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have 
increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide 
products and services to our customers, as customer, public, 
legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and 
information security have increased, and as cyber and other 
information security attacks have become more prevalent and 
complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure 
must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential 
failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, 
accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems 
and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient 
based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or 
damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that 
are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there 

have been and could in the future be sudden increases in 
customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications 
outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile 
banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from 
local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist 
acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information 
security incidents. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to 
our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, 
entail significant costs, and create risks associated with 
implementing new systems and integrating them with existing 
ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our 
systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and 
operating systems, including their security measures and 
controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and 
security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover 
critical business processes or operations that have been 
disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and 
consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business 
continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide 
operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely 
affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical 
infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses 
and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we 
experienced system issues caused by an automatic power 
shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although 
applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed 
to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our 
services, including our online and mobile banking systems, 
certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM 
functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our 
customers. 

As a result of financial institutions and technology systems 

becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational 
incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material 
impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, 
third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as 
exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors 
that provide services or security solutions for our operations, 
could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including 
from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or 
failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies 
in the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are 
heightened to the extent we rely on a single third party or on 
third parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to 
the risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a 
common service provider to our third parties could impede their 
ability to provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. 
In addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and 
expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, 
and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their 
obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules,

consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition. 

compromised due to information security incidents affecting 
those third parties. 

A cyber attack or other information security incident could 
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, 
financial condition, or reputation.  Information security risks for 
large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally 
increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of 
new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and 
cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the increase 
in remote work arrangements, and the increased sophistication 
and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, 
and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored 
parties. Those parties also may continue to attempt to 
misrepresent personal or financial information to commit fraud, 
obtain loans or other financial products from us, or attempt to 
fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our 
systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or other 
information to gain access to our data or that of our customers. 
Geopolitical matters, such as the conflict in Ukraine, may also 
elevate the risk of an information security threat, particularly by 
foreign state-sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted 
above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission 
and storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in 
our computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, 
investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our 
digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, 
hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, 
to access our products and services, our customers may use 
personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are 
beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, 
software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be 
the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, 
which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of 
fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our 
customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or 
the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third 
parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have 
reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large 
amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card 
information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur 
costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent 
transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed 
to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of 
the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and 
procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security 
controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. 

Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of 

financial institutions and technology systems, an information 
security incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream 
service providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact 
to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties 
(including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, 
including those that facilitate our business activities or to which 
we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, 
hardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be 
sources of information security risk to us. We could suffer 
material harm, including business disruptions, losses or 
remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the 
failure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately 
safeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and 
software, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being 

Our risk and exposure to information security threats 

remains heightened because of, among other things, the 
persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent 
size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services 
industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and 
mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote 
connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how 
they want to be served, our geographic footprint and 
international presence, the outsourcing of some of our business 
operations, and the current global economic and political 
environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other financial 
institutions, as well as our third-party service providers, continue 
to be the target of various evolving and adaptive information 
security threats, including cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, 
other malicious software intended to exploit hardware or 
software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and 
distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the 
operations of financial institutions, test their cybersecurity 
capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or 
other information. Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting 
online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as 
cloud-based and other products and services provided by third 
parties, and have targeted the infrastructure of the internet, 
causing the widespread unavailability of websites and degrading 
website performance. As a result, information security and the 
continued development and enhancement of our controls, 
processes and systems designed to protect our networks, 
computers, software and data from attack, damage or 
unauthorized access remain a priority for Wells Fargo. We are 
also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and 
working with other parties, including our third-party service 
providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency to information security threats. 
As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be 
required to expend significant resources to develop and enhance 
our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any 
information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the 
investigation of any information security breach is inherently 
unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not 
be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, 
which may further increase any associated costs and 
consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers 
aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be 
sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses associated with an 
information security breach. 

Cyber attacks or other information security incidents 
affecting us or third parties (including their downstream service 
providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, or 
affecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers 
use to access our products and services, could result in business 
disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations 
of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or 
other adverse consequences, any of which could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in 
mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework 
seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established 
processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, 
monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are 
subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest

Risk Factors (continued)
 

rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 
management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, 
identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also 
dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a 
sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to 
develop effective operational controls or to foster the 
appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the 
inability to align performance management and compensation to 
achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we 
are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we 
may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We 
process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed 
to risks or losses if we do not accurately or completely execute a 
process or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise; 
if we are unable to detect and prevent fraudulent activity; or if an 
employee or third-party service provider fails to comply with 
applicable policies and procedures, inappropriately circumvents 
controls, or engages in other misconduct. 

damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. 
The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve 
these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we 
have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business 
restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations 
under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or 
other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing 
and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions 
on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer 
certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access 
capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of 
customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to 
meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, 
depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, 
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or public 
opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of 
reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to 
keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and 
retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have 
other material adverse effects on our results of operations and 
financial condition. 

In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor 

Furthermore, we have identified and may in the future 

and predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and 
credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, 
there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or 
sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future 
events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are 
subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, 
penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business 
activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required 
modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital 
ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and 
compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and 
assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any 
issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our 
aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could 
result in ineffective risk management practices, business 
decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or 
inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use 
artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our 
business decisions and risk management practices, but there is 
no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or 
sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human assessment or 
accurately predict future events or exposures. Previous financial 
and credit crises and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted 
both the importance and some of the limitations of managing 
unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on 
ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, 
build and maintain robust risk management policies and 
practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, 
we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory 
proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to 
retail sales practices and instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm.  Various government entities and 
offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or 
investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the 
Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney 
announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various 
non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking 

identify areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including as a result of our continuing 
efforts to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure. For 
example, we have identified certain issues related to past 
practices involving certain automobile collateral protection 
insurance policies and certain issues related to the unused 
portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or insurance 
agreements. The identification of such areas or instances where 
customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, 
and in some cases has already resulted in, additional remediation 
costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance and other costs, reputational damage, 
or other adverse consequences. 

For additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales 

Practices Matters” and “Overview – Customer Remediation 
Activities” sections and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We may incur fines, penalties and other negative 
consequences from regulatory violations or from any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We maintain 
systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to 
heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and 
expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly 
complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject 
to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to 
various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or 
issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations 
and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in 
the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental 
entities in different jurisdictions. Similarly, regulators may be 
more likely to pursue investigations or proceedings against us to 
the extent that we are or have previously been subject to other 
regulatory actions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions 
in which we operate may be different or even conflict with each 
other, such as differences between U.S. federal and state law or 
differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to the products 
and services we may offer or other business activities we may 
engage in, which can lead to compliance difficulties or issues. 
Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require us to

other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, 
exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to 
fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative 
consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately 
provide regulatory reports, customer notices or disclosures. 
Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the 
imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though 
the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even 
though there were systems and procedures in place at the time 
designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to 
regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in 
the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain 
non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. 
OFAC may impose penalties or restrictions on certain activities 
for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable 
processes are in place to prevent the violations. Any violation of 
these or other applicable laws or regulatory requirements, even if 
inadvertent or unintentional, or any failure to meet regulatory 
standards or expectations, including any failure to satisfy the 
conditions of any consent orders or other regulatory actions, 
could result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our 
ability to engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, 
loss of customers, or other negative consequences. 

Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged 
conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry 
generally, could adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk 
to our business, earnings and capital from negative public 
opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased 
substantially because of our size and profile in the financial 
services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances 
where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative 
public opinion about the financial services industry generally or 
Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and 
our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion 
could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of 
activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other 
consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing 
activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client 
accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business 
relationships; identification and management of potential 
conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests 
with and among our customers; environmental, social and 
governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; 
incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or 
inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, 
and from actions taken by government regulators and 
community or other organizations in response to that conduct. 
Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to 
detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party 
service providers that could potentially harm customers or our 
reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and 
procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. 
Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or 
prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our 
business or operations could result in significant reputational 
harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses 
under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one 
business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, 
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain 
members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect 
our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized 
by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use 

of social media by our employees and others, including personal 
blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that 
negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be 
posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or 
have other negative consequences, including as a result of our 
employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized 
manner in various social media outlets. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been 
targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, 
which have included disrupting the operation of our retail 
banking locations, and have been subject to negative public 
commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for 
various products and services. Wells Fargo and other financial 
institutions have also been subject to negative publicity as a 
result of providing or reducing financial services to or making 
investments in industries or organizations subject to stakeholder 
concerns. There can be no assurance that continued protests or 
negative public opinion of the Company specifically or large 
financial institutions generally will not harm our reputation and 
adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial 
condition. 

If we are unable to develop and execute effective business 
plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our 
competitive standing and results of operations could suffer.  In 
order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business 
plans or strategies related to, among other things, our 
organizational structure, our compliance and risk management 
framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products 
and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the 
geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve 
our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do 
business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we 
offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business 
plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require 
significant financial, technological, management and other 
resources, may divert management attention and resources away 
from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses 
and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any 
business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency 
initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are 
unable to develop or execute effective business plans or 
strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive 
position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of 
operations may be adversely affected. 

In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest 
certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture 
may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other 
benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than 
expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain 
customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses 
or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other 
long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets. 

Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our 
products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of 
companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We 
generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we 
can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other 
financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or 
on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals 
will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches 
and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a 
condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to

Risk Factors (continued)
 

be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 
common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may 
cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, 
increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected 
benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in 
higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an 
increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our 
business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability 
to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated 
benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on 
integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing 
businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the 
acquired company or business operates internationally or in a 
geographic location where we do not already have significant 
business operations and/or employees. 

Our operations and business could be adversely affected by the 
impacts of climate change.  The physical effects of climate 
change, including the increased prevalence and severity of 
extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as 
hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere 
with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, 
which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause 
losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively 
affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the 
credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the 
deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, 
changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on 
account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a 
low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain 
industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit 
risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products 
and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon 
economy could affect our business practices or result in 
additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business 
operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with 
climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and 
expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could 
require us to change certain of our business and/or risk 
management practices, impose additional costs on us, or 
otherwise adversely affect our operations and business. 
Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result of our 
response to climate change or our strategy for the transition to a 
low carbon economy, including if we are unable or perceived to be 
unable to achieve our objectives or if our response is disliked, 
disfavored, or perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. For 
additional information on regulatory developments in response 
to climate change, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this 
Report. 

We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences from legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its 
subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, 
arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning 
matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and 
many of those proceedings and investigations expose 
Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate 
outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for 
legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We 
may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not 
established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a 

legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts 
accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal 
proceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought 
and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations and financial condition. 

As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory 

oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory 
investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition 
to imposing potentially significant monetary penalties, business 
restrictions, and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may 
require criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and 
compliance with other conditions in connection with settling 
such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of 
customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, 
limitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or services, 
and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. 

For additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 

Financial Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS 

Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to 
quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, 
and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to 
reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new 
mortgage loans.  We earn revenue from fees we receive for 
originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. 
Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair 
value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage 
loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from 
loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our 
MSRs can increase due to a decline in the likelihood of 
prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. When 
rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the 
value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some 
offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural 
hedge,” the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. 

We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of 
our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. 
Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant 
losses from our hedging activities. 

We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet 
their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring 
agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee 
loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or 
government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their 
purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, 
and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We 
cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will 
not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of 
conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a 
conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower 
eligibility). As noted above, there are various proposals to reform 
the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the 
GSEs in the housing finance market. The impact of any such 
regulatory reform regarding the housing finance market and the 
GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and 
financial results, are uncertain. In addition, to meet customer 
needs, we also originate loans that do not conform to either the 
GSEs’ or government insuring agencies’ standards, which are 
generally retained on our balance sheet and therefore do not 
generate sale proceeds that could be used to originate new loans.

and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of 
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” 
sections in this Report. 

We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse 
consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect 
to the residential mortgage loans we originate or service.  For 
residential mortgage loans that we originate, we could become 
subject to monetary damages and other civil penalties, including 
the loss of certain contractual payments or the inability to 
exercise certain remedies under the loans such as foreclosure 
proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the loans were not 
originated in accordance with applicable laws or regulations. 
Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we 

originate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or 
indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or 
insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach 
of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements 
under which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty 
agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. We 
establish a mortgage repurchase liability that reflects 
management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we have a 
repurchase obligation. Because the level of the liability depends 
on economic factors and other external conditions, the level of 
the liability is difficult to estimate, requires considerable 
management judgment, and is subject to change. If economic 
conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have 
increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on 
repurchases, requiring significant additions to the repurchase 
liability. 

Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for 
the mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer 
or master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization 
trustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to 
repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit 
losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing 
income. 

We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or 
securitization investors, legal proceedings, or other adverse 
consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, 
including with respect to mortgage foreclosure actions or if we 
experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our net servicing 
income and the fair value of our MSRs may be negatively 
affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of 
higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs. In addition, we 
may continue to be subject to fines, business restrictions, and 
other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result 
of actual or perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing 
practices, including with respect to our foreclosure practices, our 
loss mitigation activities such as loan modifications or 
forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone properties. Any of 
these actions may harm our reputation, negatively affect our 
residential mortgage origination or servicing business, or result in 
material fines, penalties, equitable remedies, or other 
enforcement actions. We may also face risks, including 
regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue our 
previously announced plans to reduce the amount of residential 
mortgage loans we service. 

For additional information, see the “Overview,” “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking 
Activities,” and “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of 
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights” sections and Note 13 

(Legal Actions) and Note 18 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

COMPETITIVE RISKS 

We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly 
evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other 
financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is 
undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory 
reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and 
current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among 
other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and 
enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality 
of our customer service, the wide variety of products and 
services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those 
products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and 
preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the 
extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our 
innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased 
competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect 
our customer relationships, market share and results of 
operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in 
our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our 
ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from 
time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly 
by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for 
large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our 
competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products 
and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for 
those products and services could result in a loss of customer 
relationships and market share and could materially adversely 
affect our results of operations. 

Continued technological advances and the growth of 

e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository 
institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were 
banking products, and for financial institutions and other 
companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial 
solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and 
payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including 
digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may 
diminish the importance of depository institutions and other 
financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. 
We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive 
threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to 
sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our 
business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, 
and/or develop new products and services to respond to our 
customers’ needs and preferences. To the extent we are not 
successful in developing and introducing new products and 
services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape 
or to changes in customer preferences, we may lose customer 
relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations 
may be materially adversely affected. 

Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical 
to the success of our business and failure to do so could 
adversely affect our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is 
heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, 
including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, 
including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, 
capital markets, risk management and technology, the 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also 
seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of 
succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires 
our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control 
over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual 
report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” 
in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not 
identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any 
given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our 
reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. 
We could also be required to devote significant resources to 
remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may 
rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and 
internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those 
controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation 
or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit 
services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to 
preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found 
not to be independent of us, we could be required to engage new 
auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with 
the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new 
financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our 
ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse 
consequences. 

* * * 

Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC 

filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely 
affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly 
reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2023 for material 
changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors 
not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could 
adversely affect our financial results and condition. 

Risk Factors (continued)
 

and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide 
competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, 
effectively manage employee performance and development, 
and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large 
financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain 
subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on 
compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our 
ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially 
if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same 
compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract 
and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior 
leadership positions, our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects may be adversely affected. 

FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS 

Changes in accounting standards, and changes in how 
accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could 
materially affect our financial results and condition.  From time 
to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting 
and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our 
external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard 
setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such 
as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their 
previous interpretations or positions on how these standards 
should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting 
standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond 
our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially affect 
our financial results and condition, including requiring a 
retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. 
Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also 
materially affect our financial statements. For additional 
information, see the “Current Accounting Developments” section 
in this Report. 

Our financial statements require certain assumptions and 
estimates and rely on the effectiveness of our internal control 
over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required 
to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our 
financial statements, including, among other items, in 
determining the allowance for credit losses, the liability for 
contingent litigation losses, and the fair value of certain assets 
and liabilities such as debt securities, loans held for sale, MSRs, 
derivative assets and liabilities, and equity securities. Several of 
our accounting policies are critical because they require 
management to make difficult, subjective and complex 
judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and 
because it is likely that materially different amounts would be 
reported under different conditions or using different 
assumptions. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our 
financial results are incorrect or different from actual results, we 
could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, 
some of which could be significant. For a description of our 
critical accounting policies, see the “Critical Accounting Policies”
