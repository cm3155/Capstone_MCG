Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the 
Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 
Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding. 
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible 
common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common 
equity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding 
reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
For additional information, see the “Capital Management” section and Note 23 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Represents TLAC divided by RWAs, which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule.

This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). 

When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries 
(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the Glossary of Acronyms for definitions of terms used 
throughout this Report. 

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one 
in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses 
in the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the 
U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and 
mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance, through our four reportable operating 
segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, 
Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment 
Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 41 on Fortune’s 2022 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at September 30, 2022. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control 

infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The 
Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or 
delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or 
delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on 
others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory 
action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, 
enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which 
could be significant. While we still have significant work to do, the 
Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to 
operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the 
highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in 
place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 

and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second 
third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy 
and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet 
satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we 
believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other 
enforcement actions. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a 
$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to 
insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s 
April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the

Overview (continued) 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the 
execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party 
residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB 
consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk 
Factors” section in our 2021 Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal 
Actions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify 
areas or instances where customers may have experienced 
financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and 
implement additional operational and control procedures. We are 
working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. 

We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs 
related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts 
may change based on additional facts and information, as well as 
ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our 
ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our 
risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the 
future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To 
the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any 
customer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have 
previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. 

For additional information regarding accruals for customer 
remediation, see the “Expenses” section in Note 18 (Employee 
Benefits and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report, 
and for additional information regarding these activities, 
including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” 
section in our 2021 Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely 
referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at 
which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. 
On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 
Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator 
of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no 
longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 
2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR 
settings would no longer be published on a representative basis 
after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions 
convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate 
the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the 
Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference 
Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. 
Additionally, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have issued guidance 
strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD 
LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts. 

In preparation for the cessation of the various LIBOR 

settings, we have undertaken a variety of activities. Among other 
things, we proactively implemented internal “stop-sell” dates to 
discontinue offering products referencing LIBOR except 
pursuant to limited exceptions consistent with regulatory 
guidance. At the same time, we expanded our suite of product 
offerings that are indexed to alternative reference rates. 

We also continue to transition our legacy LIBOR contracts to 

alternative reference rates. We transitioned substantially all of 
our legacy contracts with LIBOR settings impacted by the 
December 31, 2021, cessation date to alternative reference 
rates, and we will continue to address contracts with LIBOR 
settings that are impacted by the June 30, 2023, cessation date. 
In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act (the 

LIBOR Act) was enacted to provide a statutory framework to 
replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in contracts 
that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback 
provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. We 
expect that the LIBOR Act will allow for the transition of certain 
of our commercial credit facilities and other contracts that do 
not have appropriate fallback provisions to replace LIBOR. 

For additional information on the amounts of certain of our 
LIBOR-linked contracts, as well as our transition plans for these 
contracts, see the “Overview – Recent Developments – LIBOR 
Transition” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. For information 
regarding the risks and potential impact of LIBOR or any other 
referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced 
or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K.

In third quarter 2022, we generated $3.5 billion of net income 
and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $0.85, 
compared with $5.1 billion of net income and diluted EPS of 
$1.17 in the same period a year ago. Financial performance for 
third quarter 2022 compared with the same period a year ago, 
included the following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net interest income, 
partially offset by lower mortgage banking income, net gains 
from equity securities, and investment advisory and other 
asset-based fee income; 
provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth 
and a less favorable economic environment; 
noninterest expense increased due to higher operating 
losses, partially offset by lower personnel expense, and 
professional and outside services expense; 
average loans increased driven by loan growth across both 
our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
average deposits decreased driven by reductions in 
Corporate and Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, 
Wealth and Investment Management, and Corporate, 
partially offset by growth in Consumer Banking and Lending. 

In the first nine months of 2022, we generated $10.3 billion of 
net income and diluted EPS of $2.47, compared with $15.8 billion 
of net income and diluted EPS of $3.57 in the same period a year 
ago. Financial performance for the first nine months of 2022, 
compared with the same period a year ago, included the 
following: 
• 

total revenue decreased due to lower net gains from equity 
securities, mortgage banking, and investment advisory and 
other asset-based fee income, partially offset by higher net 
interest income; 
provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth 
and a less favorable economic environment; 
noninterest expense increased due to higher operating 
losses, partially offset by lower personnel expense, and 
professional and outside services expense; 
average loans increased driven by loan growth across both 
our commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in Consumer 
Banking and Lending, partially offset by reductions in 
Corporate and Investment Banking and Corporate.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in the first nine months 
of 2022, with total equity of $178.4 billion at September 30, 
2022, compared with $190.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Our 
liquidity and regulatory capital ratios remained strong at 
September 30, 2022, including: 
• 

our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.33% under 
the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 
9.10%; 
our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of 
total risk-weighted assets was 23.00%, compared with the 
regulatory minimum of 21.50%; and 
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 123%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%.

See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the following: 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$13.2 billion at September 30, 2022, decreased $563 million 
from December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty 
around the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
our loan portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by loan 
growth and a less favorable economic environment. 

• 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $576 million in 
the first nine months of 2022, compared with $(3.7) billion 
in the same period a year ago, reflecting loan growth and a 
less favorable economic environment. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.40% at 
September 30, 2022, compared with 1.54% at December 31, 
2021. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $6 million 
in third quarter 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$38 million, or 3 basis points, in the same period a year ago.

December 31, 2021, driven by improved credit quality across 
our commercial loan portfolios, and a decrease in residential 
mortgage nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment 
performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-19-related 
accommodation programs. NPAs represented 0.60% of total 
loans at September 30, 2022. 

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended September 30, 
2022 and 2021. 

For additional information about net interest income and 

net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net 
Interest Income” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Overview (continued) 

• 

Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $393 million, 
or 40 basis points of average consumer loans, in third 
quarter 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$221 million, or 23 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, driven by higher losses in our auto and credit card 
portfolios. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $5.7 billion at 

September 30, 2022, decreased $1.6 billion, or 22%, from 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for third quarter 2022 was $3.5 billion 
($0.85 diluted EPS), compared with $5.1 billion ($1.17 diluted 
EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in 
third quarter 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, 
predominantly due to a $2.5 billion decrease in noninterest 
income, a $2.2 billion increase in provision for credit losses, and a 
$1.0 billion increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 
$3.2 billion increase in net interest income and a $627 million 
decrease in income tax expense. 

Net income for the first nine months of 2022 was 

$10.3 billion ($2.47 diluted EPS), compared with $15.8 billion 
($3.57 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income 
decreased in the first nine months of 2022, compared with the 
same period a year ago, predominantly due to a $8.5 billion 
decrease in noninterest income and a $4.3 billion increase in 
provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $5.0 billion 
increase in net interest income, a $1.7 billion decrease in income 
tax expense, and a $1.1 billion decrease in net income from 
noncontrolling interests. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and net interest margin increased in both 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, compared with 
the same periods a year ago, due to the impact of higher interest 
rates on earning assets, higher loan balances, and lower 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, 
partially offset by lower interest income from Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) loans and loans purchased from 
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan 
securitization pools, and higher expenses for interest-bearing 
deposits and long-term debt. Interest income from PPP loans 
was $85 million in the first nine months of 2022, compared with 
$389 million in the same period a year ago. Additionally, interest 
income associated with loans we purchased from GNMA loan 
securitization pools was $497 million in the first nine months of 
2022, compared with $737 million in the same period a year ago. 
For additional information about loans purchased from GNMA 
loan securitization pools, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in this 
Report.

The average balance amounts represent amortized costs, except for certain held-to-maturity debt securities, which exclude unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of those securities 
from available-for-sale debt securities. The interest rates are based on interest income or expense amounts for the period and are annualized. Interest rates and amounts include the effects of hedge 
and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories. 

(2)  Nonaccrual loans and any related income are included in their respective loan categories. 
(3) 

Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $105 million for both quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and $320 million and $321 million for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, 
respectively, predominantly related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and securities.

Deposit-related fees decreased reflecting: 
• 

lower treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by a higher earnings credit rate due to an increase in 
interest rates; and 
the elimination of non-sufficient funds and other fees. 

• 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
• 

lower residential mortgage origination volumes and lower 
gain on sale margins; and 
lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 

• 

We have continued to implement our previously announced 
enhancements and changes to limit consumer overdraft-related 
fees. We expect this will continue to lower certain deposit-
related fees. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting: 
• 

lower asset-based and trust fees due to divestitures in 
fourth quarter 2021; and 
lower average market valuations. 

• 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” section in this Report. 

Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market 
activity. 

Net servicing income decreased driven by: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others; 
partially offset by: 
• 

a lower decline in residential mortgage servicing rights 
(MSRs) as a result of reduced prepayment rates, partially 
offset by net unfavorable hedge results due to interest rate 
volatility. 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting higher 
foreign exchange, equities, rates, and commodities trading 
revenue. 

Net gains from debt securities decreased due to lower gains on 
sales of corporate debt securities. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
lower unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
• 
driven by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; and 
a $389 million impairment of equity securities (before the 
impact of noncontrolling interests) in third quarter 2022 
primarily in our affiliated venture capital business driven by 
market conditions; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher realized gains on the sales of equity securities. 

Other income decreased driven by net foreign exchange losses 
resulting from the revaluation of non-U.S. denominated assets 
and liabilities.

Net gains from trading activities increased driven by: 
• 

higher commodities, foreign exchange, rates, and equities 
trading revenue; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower trading activity in residential MBS and high yield 
products. 

Net gains from debt securities decreased due to lower gains on 
sales of corporate debt securities and agency MBS. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
lower unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
• 
driven by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; and 
a $1.4 billion impairment of equity securities (before the 
impact of noncontrolling interests) in the first nine months 
of 2022 predominantly in our affiliated venture capital 
business driven by market conditions. 

• 

Other income decreased driven by: 
• 

a gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio in the first 
nine months of 2021; 
net foreign exchange losses resulting from the revaluation 
of non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities; and 
higher losses due to growth in wind energy investments 
(offset by benefits and credits in income tax expense); 

• 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we sold. For additional information, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – 
Equity Securities” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First nine months of 2022 vs. first nine months of 2021 

Deposit-related fees increased reflecting: 
• 

lower fee waivers as the first nine months of 2021 included 
additional accommodations to support customers; and 
higher overdraft fees driven by increased consumer 
transaction volumes, partially offset by the elimination of 
non-sufficient funds and other fees. 

• 

We have continued to implement our previously announced 
enhancements and changes to limit consumer overdraft-related 
fees. We expect this will continue to lower certain deposit-
related fees. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting: 
• 

lower asset-based and trust fees due to divestitures in 
fourth quarter 2021; and 
lower average market valuations. 

• 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” section in this Report. 

Commissions and brokerage services fees decreased driven by 
lower transactional revenue. 

Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market 
activity, as well as a $107 million write-down on unfunded 
leveraged finance commitments in second quarter 2022 due to 
the widening of market spreads. 

Card fees increased reflecting higher incentives and higher 
interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased purchase 
and transaction volumes. 

Net servicing income increased driven by a lower decline in 
residential MSRs as a result of reduced prepayment rates, 
partially offset by net unfavorable hedge results due to interest 
rate volatility. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
• 

lower residential mortgage origination volumes and lower 
gain on sale margins; and 
lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 

•

Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

lower revenue-related compensation expense; and 
the impact of divestitures and efficiency initiatives. 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expenses for technology contracts. 

Operating losses increased driven by $2.0 billion of accruals in 
third quarter 2022, primarily related to a variety of historical 
matters, including litigation, customer remediation, and 
regulatory matters. 

We expect outstanding litigation, customer remediation, 

and regulatory matters could result in significant additional 
expense in the coming quarters. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

First nine months of 2022 vs. first nine months of 2021 

Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
• 

the impact of divestitures and efficiency initiatives; 

• 

• 
• 

lower revenue-related compensation expense; and 
lower incentive compensation expense, including the impact 
of lower market valuations on stock-based compensation.

We expect outstanding litigation, customer remediation, 

and regulatory matters could result in significant additional 
expense in the coming quarters. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Leases expense decreased driven by lower depreciation expense 
from a reduction in the size of our operating lease asset portfolio. 

Other expenses decreased driven by: 
• 

lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP 
processing fees in the first nine months of 2021; and 
a write-down of goodwill in the first nine months of 2021 
related to the sale of our student loan portfolio.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 5. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income 
from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 

Table 5:  Management Reporting Structure 

business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see the “Corporate” section below. 
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are 
included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Excludes nonaccrual loans. 
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. 

Third quarter 2022 vs. third quarter 2021 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
origination volumes and gain on sale margins, and lower 
revenue related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth, a 
less favorable economic environment, and higher net charge-
offs. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher operating losses reflecting higher accruals primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, 
customer remediation, and regulatory matters; and 
higher operating costs; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related 

compensation in Home Lending due to lower production and 
the impact of efficiency initiatives; 
lower occupancy expense related to efficiency initiatives; and 
lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP 
processing fees in third quarter 2021. 

• 
• 

First nine months of 2022 vs. first nine months of 2021 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and higher deposit balances and deposit spreads; 
higher deposit-related fees reflecting lower fee waivers as 
the first nine months of 2021 included additional 
accommodations to support customers, and higher 
overdraft fees in the first nine months of 2022 driven by 
increased consumer transaction volumes, partially offset by 
the elimination of non-sufficient funds and other fees in 
2022; and 
higher card fees reflecting higher incentives and higher 
interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased

Earnings Performance (continued) 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
origination volumes and gain on sale margins, and lower 
revenue related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth, a 
less favorable economic environment, and higher net charge-
offs. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher operating losses reflecting higher accruals primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, 
customer remediation, and regulatory matters; 

partially offset by: 

Table 6b:  Consumer Banking and Lending – Balance Sheet 

• 

• 

• 

lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related 
incentive compensation in Home Lending due to lower 
production and the impact of efficiency initiatives; 
lower occupancy expense and professional and outside 
services expense related to efficiency initiatives; and 
lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP 
processing fees in the first nine months of 2021.

Third quarter 2022 vs. third quarter 2021 

Total loans (average) increased driven by higher customer 
purchase volume and the impact of new products in our Credit 
Card business, as well as higher loan balances in our Home 
Lending, Auto, and Personal Lending businesses, partially offset 
by a decline in PPP loans in Consumer and Small Business 
Banking. 

Total deposits (average) increased driven by higher levels of 
customer liquidity and savings. 

First nine months of 2022 vs. first nine months of 2021 

Total loans (average) decreased as paydowns exceeded 
originations in our Home Lending and Consumer and Small 
Business Banking businesses, partially offset by higher customer 
purchase volume and the impact of new products in our Credit 
Card business, as well as higher loan balances in our Auto 

business. Home Lending loan balances were impacted by the 
resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA loan 
securitization pools and the continued suspension of home 
equity originations. Consumer and Small Business Banking loan 
balances were impacted by a decline in PPP loans. 

Total loans (period-end) increased driven by higher customer 
purchase volume and the impact of new products in our Credit 
Card business, as well as growth in our Home Lending and 
Personal Lending businesses, partially offset by a decline in PPP 
loans in Consumer and Small Business Banking. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
higher levels of customer liquidity and savings.

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net gains from trading activities reflecting higher 
foreign exchange, equities, rates, and commodities trading 
revenue; and 
higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates, 
as well as higher loan balances; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower investment banking fees due to lower market activity. 

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less 
favorable economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased predominantly driven by higher 
operating costs, partially offset by the impact of efficiency 
initiatives.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First nine months of 2022 vs. first nine months of 2021 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates, 
as well as higher loan balances; and 
higher net gains from trading activities driven by higher 
commodities, foreign exchange, rates, and equities trading 
revenue, partially offset by lower trading activity in 
residential MBS and high yield products; 

• 

widening of market spreads; and 
lower other noninterest income driven by lower mortgage 
banking income due to lower commercial MBS gain on sale 
margins and volumes, partially offset by higher income in 
our low-income housing business. 

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth and a less 
favorable economic environment. 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower investment banking fees due to lower market activity, 
as well as a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged 
finance commitments in second quarter 2022 due to the 

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating losses 
and operating costs, partially offset by the impact of efficiency 
initiatives.

Total deposits (period-end) decreased as customers continued 
to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are generally based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 6h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes 
that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows 
management, investors, and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

For third quarter 2022 and 2021, the average fee rate by

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 

Third quarter 2022 vs. third quarter 2021 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net gains from equity securities due to lower 
unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities from 
our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, 
and higher impairment driven by market conditions; 
lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees 
reflecting divestitures in fourth quarter 2021; and 
lower gains on sales of corporate debt securities; 

• 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates, 
partially offset by the sale of our Corporate Trust Services 
business in 2021. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher operating losses reflecting higher accruals primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation 
and regulatory matters; and 
higher pension plan expenses; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

the impact of divestitures. 

First nine months of 2022 vs. first nine months of 2021 

• 

• 
• 

lower gains on sales of corporate debt securities; and 
a gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio in the first 
nine months of 2021; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we sold. 

Provision for credit losses decreased due to lower net charge-
offs driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio in the first 
nine months of 2021. 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 
• 

the impact of divestitures; 
a write-down of goodwill in the first nine months of 2021 
related to the sale of our student loan portfolio; and 
lower lease expense driven by lower depreciation expense 
from a reduction in the size of our rail car leasing business; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher operating losses reflecting higher accruals primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation 
and regulatory matters; and 
higher pension plan expenses. 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net gains from equity securities due to lower 
unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities from 
our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, 
and higher impairment driven by market conditions; 
lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees 
reflecting divestitures in fourth quarter 2021; 
lower net interest income due to higher deposit crediting 
rates paid to the operating segments and the sales of our 
student loan portfolio and our Corporate Trust Services 
business in 2021; 

• 

• 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets, net of accumulated 
depreciation, of $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion as of September 30, 
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The average age of 
our rail cars is 21 years and the rail cars are typically leased to 
customers under short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our three 
largest concentrations, which represented 55% of our rail car 
fleet as of September 30, 2022, were rail cars used for the 
transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand 
products. Impairment may result in the future based on changing 
economic and market conditions affecting the long-term 
demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At September 30, 2022, our assets totaled $1.88 trillion, down 
$70.3 billion from December 31, 2021. 

The following discussion provides additional information 
about the major components of our consolidated balance sheet.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $6 million and $8 million related to available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 
2021, respectively, and $96 million related to held-to-maturity debt securities at both September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 7 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments 

in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K for information on our investment management 
objectives and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management” section in this Report for information on 
liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 
2021. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities, including HTM 
debt securities through securitizations of loans held for sale 
(LHFS), were more than offset by portfolio runoff and AFS debt 
security sales. In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities 
with a fair value of $48.6 billion to HTM debt securities in the 
first nine months of 2022 due to actions taken to reposition the 
overall portfolio for capital management purposes. Debt 
securities transferred from AFS to HTM in the first nine months 
of 2022 had $4.3 billion of pre-tax unrealized losses at the time 
of the transfers. 

The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt 
securities at September 30, 2022, were driven by higher interest 
rates and wider credit spreads. 

At September 30, 2022, 99% of the combined AFS and HTM 

debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are 
based on external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-
for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and 
HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by 
security type.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 8 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased from 
December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the 
commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan 
demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, 
partially offset by paydowns. Consumer loans increased from 

Table 8:  Loan Portfolios

Commercial 

Consumer 

Total loans 

December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in the 
residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan originations, 
partially offset by loan paydowns and the transfer of first lien 
mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS), which 
predominantly related to loans purchased from GNMA loan 
securitization pools in prior periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. 
These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs 
of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, 
and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring 
activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to 
individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity 
structure of these commitments. For additional information, see 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 11 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 11 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. We continue to monitor our business, 
including our loan portfolios, for any direct, indirect, and macro-
economic impacts stemming from the conflict in Ukraine and any 
associated economic sanctions.

Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into its credit risk management activities. 

For additional information about how we manage risk, see 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in third quarter 2022 
reflected: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $5.6 billion at September 30, 2022, 

compared with $7.2 billion at December 31, 2021. 
Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased to $1.7 billion at 
September 30, 2022, compared with $2.4 billion at 
December 31, 2021, and consumer nonaccrual loans 
decreased to $3.9 billion at September 30, 2022, compared 
with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans 
represented 0.59% of total loans at September 30, 2022, 
compared with 0.81% at December 31, 2021. 

•  Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of our 
average commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 
0.00% and 0.40% in the third quarter and 0.00% and 0.36% in 
the first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared with 
0.03% and 0.23% in the third quarter and 0.07% and 0.31%, 
respectively, in the first nine months of 2021. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were 
$802 million and $496 million in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, at September 30, 2022, 
compared with $235 million and $424 million at 
December 31, 2021. 

• 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $773 million and 
$576 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2022, respectively, compared with $(1.4) billion and 
$(3.7) billion for the same periods a year ago. 
The ACL for loans decreased to $13.2 billion, or 1.40% of 
total loans, at September 30, 2022, compared with 
$13.8 billion, or 1.54%, at December 31, 2021.

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

the “Risk Management” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. The 
discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the 
management of certain risks contained in the “Risk 
Management” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of the Company’s assets and exposures such as loans, debt 
securities, and certain derivatives. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part of 
Independent Risk Management, has oversight responsibility for 
credit risk. Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk Officer and 
supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided to the 
Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio  Our loan portfolios represent the largest 
component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which 
we have credit risk. Table 10 presents our total loans outstanding 
by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions;

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $11.3 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at September 30, 2022, 
compared with $13.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline 
was driven by decreases in the technology, telecom and media, 
real estate and construction, and oil, gas and pipelines industries, 
as these industries continued to recover from the economic 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an 
increase in the equipment, machinery and parts manufacturing, 
and auto related industries. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio increased at September 30, 2022, compared 

with December 31, 2021, driven by higher loan demand resulting 
in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by 
paydowns. Table 11 provides our commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based 
on the North American Industry Classification System.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Table 11a provides further loan segmentation for our largest 
industry category, financials except banks. This category includes 
loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, 
rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment 
banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to 

help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, 
collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of 
collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a 
percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering 
underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

loans at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 
respectively, included: 
• 

$44.6 billion and $46.7 billion in the financials except banks 
industry; 
$15.9 billion in the banks industry at both periods; and 
$1.7 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines industry at both

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. We had $10.1 billion of CRE mortgage 
loans classified as criticized at September 30, 2022, compared 
with $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021, and $1.4 billion of CRE 
construction loans classified as criticized at September 30, 2022, 
compared with $1.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease 
in criticized CRE mortgage loans was driven by the hotel/motel 
and shopping center property types, as these property types 
continued to recover from the economic impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the office 
buildings property type. The credit quality of certain property 
types within our CRE loan portfolio, such as office buildings, 
could continue to be adversely affected due to uncertainty in 
their recovery from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

Table 12:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

The total CRE loan portfolio increased $7.8 billion from 
December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in CRE 
mortgage loans for apartments, mixed use properties, and 
industrial/warehouse property types, partially offset by a 
decrease in CRE mortgage loans for office buildings. The CRE 
loan portfolio included $7.4 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at 
September 30, 2022. The portfolio is diversified both 
geographically and by property type. The largest geographic 
concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Texas, 
and Florida, which represented a combined 49% of the total CRE 
portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are 
apartments at 25% and office buildings at 23% of the portfolio.

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At September 30, 2022, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$87.1 billion, representing approximately 9% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $86.9 billion, or 
approximately 10% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, 
at December 31, 2021. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 5% 
and 4% of our total consolidated assets at September 30, 2022, 
and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing

conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, 
which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

September 30, 2022, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$31.4 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $4.0 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch.

assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 13: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $51.1 billion exposure to financial institutions and $49.9 billion to non-financial corporations at September 30, 2022. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 95% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at September 30, 
2022, compared with 94% at December 31, 2021. 

The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of 
credit was $19.1 billion at September 30, 2022. The unfunded 
credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $37.6 billion 
at September 30, 2022. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 2% and 3% of total loans at September 30, 2022, 
and December 31, 2021, respectively. We believe our origination 
process appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) reset risk across our residential mortgage loans and our 
ACL for loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM 
products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with 
fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the 
financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage 
loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 

subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. 
These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only 
payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar 
features. For additional information on our residential mortgage 
loan portfolio, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. For additional information 
about appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for their use, see Note 4 
(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 
2021 Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio.

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio increased $11.9 billion from 
December 31, 2021, driven by originations, partially offset by 
loan paydowns and the transfer of first lien mortgage loans to 
loans held for sale (LHFS), which predominantly related to loans 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods.

(1)  Other consumer loans primarily include both commercial and consumer securities-based 

loans originated by the WIM operating segment. 

Credit Card  Our credit card portfolio totaled $43.6 billion at 
September 30, 2022, compared with $38.5 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The increase in the outstanding balance at 
September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was 
due to higher purchase volume and the launch of new products. 

Table 17:  Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets) 

Auto  Our auto portfolio totaled $54.5 billion at September 30, 
2022, compared with $56.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The 
outstanding balance at September 30, 2022, compared with 
December 31, 2021, decreased due to lower origination volumes. 

Other Consumer  Other consumer loans totaled $29.8 billion at 
September 30, 2022, compared with $28.3 billion at 
December 31, 2021. The increase in the outstanding balance at 
September 30, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, was 
primarily due to originations of personal lines and loans. 

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  For information about when we generally place loans on 
nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2021 
Form 10-K. Customer payment deferral activities in the 
residential mortgage portfolio instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
nonaccrual loans for those residential mortgage customers who 
would have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For 
information on customer accommodations, including loan 
modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related 
Lending Accommodations” section in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $673 million from 
December 31, 2021, due to improved credit quality across our 
commercial loan portfolios. For additional information on 
commercial nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 
Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $952 million from 
December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans primarily due to sustained payment 
performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-19-related

Table 18 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in 
developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to 
losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors 
at September 30, 2022: 
• 

94% of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured, the 
majority of which are secured by real estate. 
80% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 79% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain. 
99% of total consumer nonaccrual loans are secured, of 
which 95% are secured by real estate and 98% have a 
combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
$613 million of the $765 million of consumer loans in 
bankruptcy or discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as 
nonaccrual, were current.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed autos. 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended certain 
residential mortgage foreclosure activities through 
December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, we resumed 
these mortgage foreclosure activities. For additional information 
on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 4 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 20 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2021, 
predominantly driven by a decrease in residential mortgage – 
first lien loans, partially offset by an increase in trial 
modifications. The decrease in residential mortgage – first lien 
loans was due to paydowns and transfers to LHFS, which related 
to loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools. 

The amount of our TDRs at September 30, 2022, would have 

otherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) 

and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and 
Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers 
Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (Interagency Statement). 
Customers who are unable to resume making their contractual 
loan payments upon exiting from these deferral programs may 
require further assistance and may receive or be eligible to 
receive modifications, which may be classified as TDRs. For 
additional information on the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in our 2021 Form 10-K.

For information on our nonaccrual policies when a 

restructuring is involved, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)” section in 
our 2021 Form 10-K. See Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance

additional information regarding TDRs. 

Table 21 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

Inflows include loans that modify, even if they resolve within the period, as well as gross advances on term loans that modified in a prior period and net advances on revolving TDRs that modified in a 
prior period. 

(2)  Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to LHFS. Occasionally, loans that have been refinanced or restructured at market terms qualify 

as new loans, which are also included as other outflows. 

(3)  Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and enter into a permanent 

modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or otherwise resolved.

(1)  Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in third 
quarter 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
due to lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio. 
The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in third 
quarter 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
driven by higher losses in our auto and credit card portfolios. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities in our residential mortgage portfolio instituted 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay 
the recognition of residential mortgage loan charge-offs. For 
information on customer accommodations in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other 
off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for 
loans, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our ACL for debt securities, see Note 3 (Available-
for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Table 23 presents the allocation of the ACL for loans by loan 

portfolio segment and class.

Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 23 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans decreased $563 million, or 4%, from 
December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty around the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan 
portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by loan growth and a 
less favorable economic environment. The detail of the changes 
in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment (including charge-offs 
and recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base 
scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario 
and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans 
at September 30, 2022. The base scenario assumed modest 
economic growth with elevated inflation in the near term. The 
downside scenarios assumed economic contractions due to high 
inflation, rising interest rates, and declining property values. 

Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent 

risks inherent in our processes and assumptions such as 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at September 30 and June 30, 2022, are 
presented in Table 24.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a

quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
real GDP), among other factors. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $13.2 billion at 

September 30, 2022, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total 
loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects 
existing factors as of the date of determination, including

economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for 
loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is 
possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for 
determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and 
commercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with 
our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we 
have established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information 
on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 
2021 Form 10-K. 

In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as 
servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial 
mortgage loans included in government-sponsored entity (GSE)-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed 
mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as 
for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. 

As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 
payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of 
delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) 
to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer 
advances and servicing fees. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, 

delinquency status continues to advance for loans with COVID-
related payment deferrals, which has resulted in an increase in 
delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase 
in loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to 
repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which 
generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan 
payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally 
repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total 
consolidated assets do not change. These repurchased loan 
balances were $10.0 billion and $17.3 billion at September 30, 
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which included 
$8.2 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, in our held for 
investment loan portfolio, with the remainder in loans held for 
sale. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to transfer loans into the 
securitization market. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information about our involvement with mortgage 
loan securitizations. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage banking 

activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For 
information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 
Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a 
slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans 
and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 25, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as 
all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar 
interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the 
simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 25: 
Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
• 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across

customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher-
yielding products could impact expected net interest 
income. 
The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the 
historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the 
expectations of deposit products repricing as market 
interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas) as well as 
migration to higher cost deposit products consistent with 
the base scenario. Our actual experience may differ from 
expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit 
repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. 
•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from 
December 31, 2021, to September 30, 2022, in Table 25 
reflected updates to our base scenario, which included changes in 
expectations for both balance sheet composition and interest 
rates. Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect 
to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice 
faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the 
case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward 
and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net 
interest income. For the December 31, 2021 simulations with 
downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00% interest rate floor 
limited the amount of the decline in net interest income. We may 
have a larger decline in net interest income when interest rates 
increase for the base scenario relative to the interest rate floor. 
The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by 
mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management 
– Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2021 Form 10-K for additional 
information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted 
by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits 
that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees 
on commercial accounts, and trading assets, which are generally 
less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the related 
funding liabilities. In addition, the impact to net interest income 
does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, 
which are recorded in noninterest income. For additional 
information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in 
the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect 
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers 
the amount of our risk-based capital. AOCI also includes 

unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt 
securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized 
into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact 
from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
• 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to 
fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 

• 

In the first nine months of 2022, we entered into interest 

rate swap hedges to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt 
securities portfolio. Additionally, we entered into interest rate 
swaps to convert the interest cash flows of some floating-rate 
assets, such as commercial loans, to a fixed-rate. Derivatives 
used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures are presented in 
Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
additional information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment of private equity investments. For information on 
our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the

financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 

Table 26:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

monitoring market risk. For additional information on our 
monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see 
the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market 
Risk – Trading Activities” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 26 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 
category. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR 
for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared with the 
same period a year ago, was primarily driven by changes in the 
portfolio composition.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 
2021 Form 10-K. 

We also have marketable equity securities that include 

investments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair 
value changes in these marketable equity securities are 
recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 6 
(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 

market stress. To help achieve this objective, we monitor both 
the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis to ensure 
that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, deposit-
taking banking subsidiaries. The Parent acts as a source of 
funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term debt 
and equity, and WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), provides 
funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the 
Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For 
additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, 
see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section 
in our 2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on the IHC, 
see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and 
Related Matters” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold 
high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists 
of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and 
mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies 
to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured 
depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or 
more. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced 
liquidity risk management standards on large bank holding

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies 
to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total 
assets of $10 billion or more. As of September 30, 2022, we were 
compliant with the NSFR requirement.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the 
exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 28 at fair value, which also includes encumbered securities 
that are not included as available HQLA in the calculation of the 
LCR. 

Table 28:  Primary Sources of Liquidity 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of September 30, 2022, the 
consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo 
National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 
100%. Table 27 presents the Company’s quarterly average values 
for the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated 
pursuant to the LCR rule requirements. The LCR represents 
average HQLA divided by average projected net cash outflows, as 
each is defined under the LCR rule.

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 28, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 148% and 166% of total 
loans at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 
respectively. 

Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-

term borrowings. As of September 30, 2022, we had 
approximately $207.5 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. Table 29 presents a summary of our short-
term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. 
We pledge certain financial instruments that we own to 
collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities 
financings. For additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” 
section of Note 12 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

We access domestic and international capital markets for 
long-term funding (generally greater than one year) through 
issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and 
asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-term debt in a 
variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient 
funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. 
Proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate 
purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable 
prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the proceeds 
from securities issued in the future will be used for the same

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

On September 13, 2022, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global 
Ratings affirmed the Company’s ratings and retained the stable 

ratings outlook. There were no other actions undertaken by the 
rating agencies with regard to our credit ratings during third 
quarter 2022. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2021 Form 10-K for 

additional information regarding our credit ratings and the 
potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our 
liquidity and operations, as well as Note 14 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 

as of September 30, 2022, are presented in Table 31.

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
September 30, 2022, increased $6.2 billion from December 31, 
2021, predominantly as a result of $10.3 billion of Wells Fargo 
net income, partially offset by $3.9 billion of common and 
preferred stock dividends. During the first nine months of 2022, 
we issued $827 million of common stock, substantially all of 
which was issued in connection with employee compensation and 
benefits. In the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased 
110 million shares of common stock at a cost of $6 billion. In the 
first nine months of 2022, our AOCI decreased $12.6 billion, 
predominantly due to net unrealized losses on AFS debt 
securities. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of 
AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the 
amount of our risk-based capital. For additional information 
about capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress 
Testing” section below. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, 
and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both 
approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 32 and 
Table 33 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable 
to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced 
Approach, respectively, as of September 30, 2022. 

Table 32:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach 
as of September 30, 2022 

Table 33:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach as of 
September 30, 2022 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 32 and Table 33, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at September 30, 
2022, was 0.00%. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress.

Capital Management (continued) 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, was 
3.10%. On August 4, 2022, the FRB confirmed that the 
Company's stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2022, 
through September 30, 2023, is 3.20%. 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also 

subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital 
surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually 
calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of 
the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our 
size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 

Table 34:  Capital Components and Ratios 

wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If 
our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our 
annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. For 
2022, our G-SIB capital surcharge is 1.50%. Our G-SIB capital 
surcharge will not change in 2023. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Table 34 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total 
capital, RWAs and capital ratios at September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period-end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of the current expected credit loss accounting 
standard (CECL) on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two 
and 75% in year three. 
Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of 
qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 
1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs. 

Table 36 provides the composition of our RWAs under the 

Standardized and Advanced Approaches at September 30, 2022, 
and December 31, 2021.

RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period-end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The rule permits 
certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each 
period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two and 75% in year three.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in 
consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred 
taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, 
which represents tangible common equity divided by common 
shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of 
determining tangible common equity may differ among 
companies. Management believes that tangible book value per 
common share and return on average tangible common equity, 
which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial 
measures because they enable management, investors, and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 39 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 40 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
September 30, 2022. 

Table 40:  Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 
rules. For information regarding the proposed amendments to 
the SLR rules, see the “Capital Management – Leverage 
Requirements” section in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
September 30, 2022, are presented in Table 42.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo 

Securities, LLC and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are 
subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital 
requirements. As of September 30, 2022, these broker-dealer 
subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory 
minimum net capital requirements. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 
100 basis points above the regulatory minimum and buffers, plus 
an incremental internal buffer of up to 25 basis points. Our 
capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, 
including changes to the regulatory requirements for our capital 
ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and 
other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

As part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB 
reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all 
large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the 
institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 

market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 
regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 
amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At September 30, 2022, we had remaining Board authority 

to repurchase approximately 251 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during third quarter 2022, see Part II, Item 2 in 
this Report. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. For a 
discussion of other significant regulations and regulatory 
oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our 
business, see the “Regulatory Matters” and “Risk Factors” 
sections in our 2021 Form 10-K and the “Regulatory Matters” 
section in our 2022 First and Second Quarter Reports on 
Form 10-Q.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2021 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. For additional information on these policies, see the 
“Critical Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2021 Form 10-K and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 44 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 44:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description and Effective Date 

Financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 
The Update, effective January 1, 2023, 
requires market risk benefits (features 
of insurance contracts that protect the 
policyholder from other-than-nominal 
capital market risk and expose the 
insurer to that risk) to be measured at 
fair value through earnings with 
changes in fair value attributable to our 
own credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. The Update 
also requires more frequent updates for 
insurance assumptions, mandates the 
use of a standardized discount rate for 
traditional long-duration contracts, and 
simplifies the amortization of deferred 
acquisition costs. 

The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited 
number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These 
variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit 
payments for the remainder of the policyholder's life once the account values are exhausted. These 
guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair 
value. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon adoption of 
the Update, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, will be 
recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the earliest period presented and will affect our 
regulatory capital calculations. At September 30, 2022, our estimated liability related to these guaranteed 
minimum benefits was approximately $600 million and was associated with approximately $9.7 billion of 
policyholder account values. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market 
risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder 
behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We plan to economically hedge the market volatility, 
where feasible. Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-
duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material. 

ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method 

The Update, effective January 1, 2023 
(with early adoption permitted), 
establishes the portfolio layer method, 
which expands an entity’s ability to 
achieve fair value hedge accounting for 
interest rate risk hedges of closed 
portfolios of financial assets. The 
Update also provides guidance on the 
accounting for hedged item basis 
adjustments under the portfolio layer 
method. 

The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with 
portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The Update 
allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of 
derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to 
include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets. 

Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. 
Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to 
available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge 
no later than 30 days after the adoption date. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on 
our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

The Update, effective January 1, 2023 
(with early adoption permitted), 
eliminates the accounting guidance for 
troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by 
creditors and introduces new required 
disclosures for loan modifications made 
to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty. The Update also amends the 
guidance for vintage disclosures to 
require disclosure of current period 
gross charge-offs by year of origination. 

The Update will impact the measurement of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and require new 
disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality, specifically the Update: 
• 

Eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the ACL for 
certain TDRs and instead allows for the use of an expected loss approach for all loans. Upon adoption, 
we expect to discontinue using a DCF approach for consumer loans and retain a DCF approach for 
certain nonperforming commercial loans. Any changes to the ACL as a result of the change in TDR 
measurement will be included as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of 
the earliest period presented. 
Requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the 
form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other than insignificant payment delay, term 
extension, or a combination of these modifications. 
Requires us to provide current period gross charge-offs by origination date (vintage) in our credit 
quality disclosures on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date.

• 

Other Accounting Developments 
The following Updates are applicable to us but are not expected 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements: 
• 

ASU 2021-08 – Business Combinations (Topic 805): 
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from 
Contracts with Customers 
ASU 2021-10 – Government Assistance (Topic 832): 
Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance 
ASU 2022-03 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair 
Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual 
Sale Restrictions

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters (including the conflict in 
Ukraine), and any slowdown in global economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company, we refer you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K.

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2022, of the Company’s disclosure controls and 
procedures. The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the 
Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective as of September 30, 2022. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the 
Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) 
and includes those policies and procedures that: 
• 

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

• 

• 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of 

any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during third quarter 
2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Financial Statements 

-See the Glossary of Acronyms at the end of this Report for terms used throughout the Financial Statements and related Notes. 

Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services 
company. We provide banking, investment and mortgage 
products and services, as well as consumer and commercial 
finance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and 
other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and 
institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in 
countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the 
Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company 
and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the 
Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding 
company. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate 
investment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock 
outstanding. 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in 
the financial services industry. For discussion of our significant 
accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K). There were 
no material changes to these policies in the first nine months of 
2022. 

To prepare the financial statements in conformity with 

GAAP, management must make estimates based on 
assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for 
example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the 
reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our 
estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect 
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual 
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, 
which could materially affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. Management has made significant estimates 
in several areas, including: 
• 

allowance for credit losses (Note 4 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses)); 
valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) 
(Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) and 
Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities)); 
valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of 
Assets and Liabilities)); 
liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 13 (Legal 
Actions)); 
income taxes; and 
goodwill impairment (Note 10 (Intangible Assets)). 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 

These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all 
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary 
for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. 
These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless 
otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations 
in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the 
results that may be expected for the full year. The interim 
financial information should be read in conjunction with our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2022 
In 2022, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: 
• 

Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2020-06 – 
Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 
470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s 
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible 
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity 
ASU 2021-05 – Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases 
with Variable Lease Payments 

• 

ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible financial 
instruments that embody characteristics of debt and equity by 
(1) eliminating accounting models for convertible financial 
instruments with cash conversion and beneficial conversion 
features within Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 
470-20, (2) removing three equity classification requirements 
for a contract in an entity's own equity to qualify for the 
derivative scope exception in ASC Subtopic 815-40, and (3) 
prescribing the method used for computing earnings per share. 
We adopted this Update prospectively in first quarter 2022. This 
Update did not have a material impact to our consolidated 
financial statements. 

ASU 2021-05 amends ASC 842 Topic – Leases and provides 
specific guidance for lessors whose leases include variable lease 
payments that are not dependent on a reference index or rate 
and otherwise would have resulted in the recognition of a loss at 
lease commencement (a day 1 loss). Prior to ASU 2016-02, 
variable lease payments were excluded from the definition of 
lease payments for lessors measuring their net investment loss in 
a sales-type lease or direct financing lease. This often resulted in 
a day 1 loss, even if the lessor expected the arrangement to be 
profitable overall. We adopted this Update prospectively in first 
quarter 2022. This Update did not have a material impact to our 
consolidated financial statements. 

Actual results could differ from those estimates.

carried at fair value, and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, 
which are carried at amortized cost, net of the ACL. The net 
unrealized gains (losses) for AFS debt securities are reported as a 
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), 
net of the ACL and applicable income taxes. Information on debt 
securities held for trading is included in Note 2 (Trading 
Activities). 

Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on 
AFS and HTM debt securities, which are included in other assets. 
See Note 7 (Other Assets) for additional information on accrued 
interest receivable. Amounts considered to be uncollectible are 
reversed through interest income. The interest income reversed 
in the third quarter and first nine months of both 2022 and 2021 
was insignificant.

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality of debt securities by evaluating various 
attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the 
appropriateness of the ACL for debt securities. The credit quality 
indicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings 
and delinquency status and are based on information as of our 
financial statement date. 

CREDIT RATINGS  Credit ratings express opinions about the credit 
quality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a 
security according to the lowest credit rating made available by 
national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). 
Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings 
similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are 
generally considered by the rating agencies and market 
participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities 
rated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by 
the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher 

credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt 
securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit 
grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management 
purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major 
credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated 
by NRSROs at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 
Table 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt 
securities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined 
to be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based 
on internal credit grades.

DELINQUENCY STATUS AND NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES  Debt 
security issuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due 
under contractual debt agreements have a higher probability of 
recognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring of 
the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we consider 
whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of 
principal or interest payments and whether any securities have 
been placed into nonaccrual status. 

Debt securities that are past due and still accruing were 
insignificant at both September 30, 2022, and December 31, 
2021. The carrying value of debt securities in nonaccrual status 
was insignificant at both September 30, 2022, and December 31, 
2021. Charge-offs on debt securities were insignificant in the 
third quarter and first nine months of both 2022 and 2021. 

Purchased debt securities with credit deterioration (PCD) 
are not considered to be in nonaccrual status, as payments from 
issuers of these securities remain current. PCD securities were 
insignificant in the third quarter and first nine months of both 
2022 and 2021.

Note 3:  Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities (continued) 

Unrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
Table 3.5 shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of AFS 
debt securities by length of time those individual securities in 
each category have been in a continuous loss position. Debt 
securities on which we have recorded credit impairment are

We have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized 

For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing 

losses included in the previous table for credit impairment. As 
part of that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do 
not intend to sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more 
likely than not that we will not be required to sell, prior to 
recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where 
necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the 
present value of the expected cash flows to the debt securities’ 
amortized cost basis. Credit impairment is recorded as an ACL for 
debt securities.

Contractual Maturities 
Table 3.6 and Table 3.7 show the remaining contractual 
maturities, amortized cost, net of the ACL, fair value and 
weighted average effective yields of AFS and HTM debt 
securities, respectively. The remaining contractual principal 

maturities for mortgage-backed securities (MBS) do not 
consider prepayments. Remaining expected maturities will differ 
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the 
right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages 
mature.

Note 4:  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses 

Table 4.1 presents total loans outstanding by portfolio segment 
and class of financing receivable. Outstanding balances include 
unearned income, net deferred loan fees or costs, and 
unamortized discounts and premiums. These amounts were less 
than 1% of our total loans outstanding at September 30, 2022, 
and December 31, 2021. 

Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on 
loans, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans. 

See Note 7 (Other Assets) for additional information on accrued 
interest receivable. Amounts considered to be uncollectible are 
reversed through interest income. During the first nine months 
of 2022, we reversed accrued interest receivable of $26 million 
for our commercial portfolio segment and $100 million for our 
consumer portfolio segment, compared with $36 million and 
$143 million, respectively, for the same period a year ago.

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. Our commercial lending commitments include, but are 
not limited to, (i) commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, (ii) financing to customers who warehouse 
financial assets secured by real estate, consumer, or corporate 
loans, (iii) financing that is expected to be syndicated or replaced 
with other forms of long-term financing, and (iv) commercial real 
estate lending. We also originate multipurpose lending 
commitments under which commercial customers have the 
option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including 
the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the unfunded 
commitment amounts of the facility. 

The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. We may reduce or cancel 
lines of credit in accordance with the contracts and applicable 
law. Certain commitments either provide us with funding 
discretion or are subject to loan agreements with covenants 
regarding the financial performance of the customer or 
borrowing base formulas that must be met before we are 
required to fund the commitment. Our credit risk monitoring 
activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to 
individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity 
structure of these commitments. We do not recognize an ACL 
for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at our 
discretion. 

We issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in 
purchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At 
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had 
$1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of outstanding issued 
commercial letters of credit. See Note 11 (Guarantees and Other 
Commitments) for additional information on issued standby 
letters of credit. 

which we have elected the fair value option and government 
insured/guaranteed residential mortgage – first lien loans 
because their loan activity normally does not impact the ACL.

We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a 

representative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide 
for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or 
letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in 
less than a week and would normally require default of both the 
customer and another lender to expose us to loss. The unfunded 
amount of these fronting arrangements totaled approximately 
$89.3 billion at September 30, 2022. 

The contractual amount of our unfunded credit 

commitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized 
in Table 4.4. The table excludes issued letters of credit and is 
presented net of commitments syndicated to others, including 
the fronting arrangements described above.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
Table 4.5 presents the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, 
which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance 
for unfunded credit commitments. The ACL for loans decreased 

$563 million from December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced 
uncertainty around the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on our loan portfolio. This decrease was partially offset 
by loan growth and a less favorable economic environment.

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and 
utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness 
of the ACL for loans. The following sections provide the credit 
quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit quality 
indicators are generally based on information as of our financial 
statement date. 

COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We manage a 
consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 
Commercial loans are generally subject to individual risk 
assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality 

ratings, which is our primary credit quality indicator. Our ratings 
are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized 
categories with the criticized segmented among special mention, 
substandard, doubtful and loss categories. 

Table 4.7 provides the outstanding balances of our 
commercial loan portfolio by risk category and credit quality 
information by origination year for term loans. Revolving loans 
may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in 
the original loan agreement or if modified in a troubled 
debt restructuring (TDR). At September 30, 2022, we had 
$527.1 billion and $22.8 billion of pass and criticized commercial 
loans, respectively.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We have various classes 
of consumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan 
delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-
to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary 
credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our 
evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer 
loan portfolio segment. 

Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for 
loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency 
is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of 
our ACL for consumer loans.

Table 4.9 provides the outstanding balances of our 
consumer loan portfolio by delinquency status. Credit quality 
information is provided with the year of origination for term 
loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a 
contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if 
modified in a TDR. The revolving loans converted to term loans in 
the credit card loan category represent credit card loans with 
modified terms that require payment over a specific term. 

Payment deferral activities in the residential mortgage 
portfolio instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could 
continue to delay the recognition of delinquencies for residential 
mortgage customers who otherwise would have moved into past 
due status.

We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are 

generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited 
circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain 
loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due 
to strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Substantially 

all loans not requiring a FICO score are securities-based loans 
originated by our retail brokerage business. 

Table 4.10 provides the outstanding balances of our 
consumer loan portfolio by FICO score. Substantially all of the 
scored consumer portfolio has an updated FICO score of 680 or 
above.

Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 

LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s unpaid principal 
balance to the property’s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) 
refers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien 
mortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line 
products) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade 
approach which first uses values provided by automated 
valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not 

available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised 
value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the 
property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised 
value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method 
considered for high value properties, generally with an original 
value of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less

Note 4:  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

NONACCRUAL LOANS  Table 4.12 provides loans on nonaccrual 
status. Nonaccrual loans may have an ACL or a negative 
allowance for credit losses from expected recoveries of amounts 
previously written off. Customer payment deferral activities in 

the residential mortgage portfolio instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
nonaccrual loans for those residential mortgage customers who 
would have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status.

(1)  Nonaccrual loans may not have an allowance for credit losses if the loss expectations are zero given the related collateral value. 

LOANS IN PROCESS OF FORECLOSURE  Our recorded investment in 
consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate 
property that are in process of foreclosure was $980 million and 
$694 million at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 
respectively, which included $744 million and $583 million, 
respectively, of loans that are government insured/guaranteed. 
Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines, we 
do not commence the foreclosure process on residential 
mortgage loans until after the loan is 120 days delinquent. 
Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending on whether 
the property address resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. 
Judicial states require the foreclosure to be processed through 
the state’s courts while non-judicial states are processed without 
court intervention. Foreclosure timelines vary according to state

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING  Certain 
loans 90 days or more past due are still accruing, because they 
are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) 
residential mortgage or consumer loans exempt under regulatory 
rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, 
usually 120 days past due. 

Table 4.13 shows loans 90 days or more past due and still 

accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed.

Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  When, for economic or 
legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, we 
grant a concession for other than an insignificant period of time 
to a borrower that we would not otherwise consider, the related 
loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of which totaled 
$9.4 billion and $10.2 billion at September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, respectively. We do not consider loan 
resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. In 
addition, COVID-related modifications are generally not 
classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and the 
Interagency Statement. For additional information on the TDR 
relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in 
our 2021 Form 10-K. 

We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period 
of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned 
permanent modification, to determine if they can perform 
according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial 
modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While 
loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not 
considered modified and they continue to advance through 
delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original 
terms. 

Commitments to lend additional funds on loans whose 
terms have been modified in a TDR amounted to $416 million 
and $431 million at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 
2021, respectively. 

Table 4.14 summarizes our TDR modifications for the 
periods presented by primary modification type and includes the 
financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that 
modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that 
occurred during the period. Loans that both modify and are paid 
off or written-off within the period, as well as changes in 
recorded investment during the period for loans modified in prior 
periods, are not included in the table.

(1) 

Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of concessions, but are presented only once in the first 
modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of $105 million and $188 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 
2021, respectively, and $355 million and $646 million for the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

(3) 

(2)  Other concessions include loans with payment (principal and/or interest) deferral, loans discharged in bankruptcy, loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but 
exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or reduce the contractual interest rate. The reported amounts include loans that are new TDRs that may have COVID-related payment deferrals 
and exclude COVID-related payment deferrals on loans previously reported as TDRs given limited current financial effects other than payment deferral. 
Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged 
down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. 
Recorded investment related to interest rate reduction reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans 
reported as a principal primary modification type that also have an interest rate concession. 
Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue 
interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial 
effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the 
current period.

Note 5:  Leasing Activity 

The information below provides a summary of our leasing 
activities as a lessor and lessee. See Note 5 (Leasing Activity) in 
our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information about our leasing 
activities. 

As a Lessor 
Noninterest income on leases, included in Table 5.1, is included in 
other noninterest income on our consolidated statement of 
income. Lease expense, included in other noninterest expense on 
our consolidated statement of income, was $186 million and 
$220 million for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, 
respectively, and $559 million and $672 million for the first nine 
months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

As a Lessee 
Substantially all of our leases are operating leases. Table 5.2 
presents balances for our operating leases.

Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 

Involvement with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization 
transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. 
SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are 
generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE 
may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative 
transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various 
forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer 
financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in 
connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and 
sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets 
we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the 
right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the 
transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls 
below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the 
benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans 
transferred to a VIE by a third party. 

In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, 
we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which 
may include: 
• 

underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently 
making markets in those securities; 
providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs 
through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; 
entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; 
holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; 
acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; 
providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and 
providing seller financing to VIEs.

Loan Sales and Securitization Activity 
We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and 
other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan 
sale transactions. 

MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED 
ENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal 
course of business we sell originated and purchased residential 
and commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored 
entities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into 
securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain 
credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer 
mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to 
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines 
which are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or 
GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA 
design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the 
involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant 
to the VIE. 

We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage 
loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate 
the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for 
the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the 
VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment 
purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing 
rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option 

to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which 
becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments 
remain unpaid by the borrower. We repurchased loans of 
$574 million and $2.1 billion, during the third quarter and first 
nine months of 2022, respectively, and $780 million and 
$3.7 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of 
2021, respectively, which predominantly represented 
repurchases of government insured loans. We recorded assets 
and related liabilities of $345 million and $107 million at 
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, 
where we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. 
Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for 

losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual 
representations and warranties, as well as other recourse 
arrangements. At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 
our liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was 
$158 million and $173 million, respectively, and the maximum 
exposure to loss was $13.6 billion and $13.3 billion at 
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
Loans serviced for others presented in Table 8.3 are 

predominantly loans in GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 
9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about 
residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and 
servicing fees. Substantially all residential servicing activity is 
related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. 

NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  In the 
normal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and 
commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that 
we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan 
securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, 
and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit 
risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We 
typically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers 
as sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain 
the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial 
interests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for 
investment purposes. Our servicing role related to 
nonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is 
limited to primary or master servicer and the most significant 
decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally 
made by the special servicer or the controlling class security 
holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan 
securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold 
variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are 
not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. 

WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS  We also sell whole loans to 
VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of 
financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not 
consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the 
most significant activities of the VIEs. 

Table 8.1 presents information about transfers of assets during 
the periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as 
sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred 
assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds 
and recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these 
interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are 
classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are 
classified as Level 2. Substantially all transfers were related to 
residential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and

resulted in no gain or loss because the loans are measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer certain 
government insured loans that we previously repurchased. These 

loans are carried at the lower of cost or market, and we recognize 
gains on such transfers when the market value is greater than the 
carrying value of the loan when it is sold.

Represents cash proceeds and the fair value of non-cash beneficial interests recognized at securitization settlement. 
Represents assets or liabilities recognized at securitization settlement date related to our continuing involvement in the transferred assets. 
Represents debt securities obtained at securitization settlement held for investment purposes that are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, which predominantly relate to agency 
securities. Excludes trading debt securities held temporarily for market-marking purposes, which are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement, of $3.0 billion and $13.3 billion 
during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, and $13.6 billion and $31.6 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively. 

In the normal course of business we purchase certain 
non-agency securities at initial securitization or subsequently in 
the secondary market, which we hold for investment. We also 
provide seller financing in the form of loans. We received cash 
flows of $95 million and $399 million during the third quarter 
and first nine months of 2022, respectively, and $116 million and 
$577 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 
2021, respectively, related to principal and interest payments on 
these securities and loans, which exclude cash flows related to 
trading activities and to the sale of our student loan portfolio.

Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are 
influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower 
behavior. 

See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) and 
Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information 
on key economic assumptions for residential MSRs. 

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES  We enter into resecuritization 
transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the 
investment and risk management activities of our customers. In 
resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities 
to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to 
third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This 
activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or 
risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the 
resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities 
issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not 
consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-
making power with third parties and do not hold significant 
economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making 
activities. We transferred $15.7 billion and $33.8 billion of 
securities to re-securitization VIEs during the nine months ended 
September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are 
not included in Table 8.1. Related total VIE assets were $113.8 
billion and $117.7 billion at September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021 we held $1.0 billion and $817 million of 
securities, respectively. $622 million and $1.1 billion of these 
securities related to resecuritizations transacted during the nine 
months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Loans Serviced for Others 
Table 8.3 presents information about loans that we sold or 
securitized in which we have ongoing involvement as servicer. 
These are primarily residential mortgage loans in GSE or GNMA 
securitizations. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days or more 
past due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless of delinquency 

Table 8.3:  Loans Serviced for Others 

status. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is our only 
form of continuing involvement, we generally experience a loss 
only if we were required to repurchase a delinquent loan or 
foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and 
warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing contracts.

(3) 

real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to net charge-off information. 
At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the table includes total loans of $711.3 billion and $736.8 billion, delinquent loans of $5.3 billion and $10.2 billion, and foreclosed assets of 
$96 million and $100 million, respectively, for FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS  We may transfer purchased 
industrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to 
VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire 
such beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a 
transferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also 
service the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the 
bonds. 

OTHER VIE STRUCTURES  We engage in various forms of 
structured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including 
asset-backed finance structures and other securitizations 
collateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral 
may include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student 
loans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or 
marketing the arrangements, as well as provide financing, service 
one or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives 
with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We 
are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we 
do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the 
VIEs. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS  Table 8.4 includes 
nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations where we 
originate and transfer the loans to the unconsolidated 
securitization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional information 
about these VIEs, see the “Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” 
section within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan 
securitizations also include commercial mortgage loan 
securitizations sponsored by third parties where we did not 
originate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and 
invest in securities that could be potentially significant to the 
VIE. 

Conforming loan securitization and resecuritization 
transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from 
Table 8.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have 
power over the activities most significant to the VIEs. 
Additionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the 
GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these 
VIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming 
mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the 
“Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” and “Resecuritization 
Activities” sections within this Note. 

TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES  We co-sponsor and make investments 
in affordable housing projects that are designed to generate a 
return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. The 
projects are typically managed by project sponsors who have the 
power over the VIE’s assets. In some instances, our investments 
in these structures may require that we fund future capital 
commitments at the discretion of the project sponsors.

Note 8:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities (continued) 

Table 8.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the 
unconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes 
investments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity 
agreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude 
certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our 
continuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature 
or insignificant in size. 

In Table 8.4, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining 
principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the 
most current information available. “Carrying value” is the 
amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our 
involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure 
to loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in 
the VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that 
have not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity 
and lending commitments, the notional amount of net written 
derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or 
stressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. 

Debt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts 

related to loans sold that we may be required to repurchase, or 
otherwise indemnify or reimburse the investor or insurer for 
losses incurred, due to material breach of contractual 
representations and warranties as well as other retained recourse 
arrangements. The maximum exposure to loss for material 
breach of contractual representations and warranties represents 
a stressed case estimate we utilize for determining stressed case 
regulatory capital needs and is considered to be a remote 
scenario. 

“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that 
would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for 
which we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as 
where the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset 
from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an 
indication of expected loss.

Consolidated VIEs 
We consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We 
are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES  We securitize 
dealer floor plan loans and leases in a revolving master trust 
entity and hold the subordinated notes and residual equity 
interests. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the 
key decisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total 
VIE assets held by the master trust represent a majority of the 
total VIE assets presented for this category in Table 8.5. In a 
separate transaction structure, we also provide the majority of 
debt and equity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and 
leasing to specific vendors and service the underlying collateral. 

OTHER VIE STRUCTURES  Other VIEs are predominantly related to 
municipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are 
vehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds through the 
issuance of short-term debt to investors. Our involvement with 
MTOBs includes serving as the residual interest holder, which 
provides control over the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the 

Table 8.5:  Transactions with Consolidated VIEs 

remarketing agent or liquidity provider related to the debt issued 
to investors. We may also securitize nonconforming mortgage 
loans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the 
underlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securities 
issued by the VIE. During second quarter 2022, we purchased the 
outstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and extinguished the 
related debt associated with such securitizations. 

Table 8.5 presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities of 
our consolidated VIEs. The carrying value represents assets and 
liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Carrying 
values of assets are presented using GAAP measurement 
methods, which may include fair value, credit impairment or 
other adjustments, and therefore in some instances will differ 
from “Total VIE assets.” 

On our consolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose 

(1) the consolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be used 
to settle the liabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated 
liabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have 
recourse to Wells Fargo.

Other Transactions 
In addition to the transactions included in the previous tables, we 
have used wholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to issue 
debt securities or preferred equity exclusively to third-party 
investors. As the sole assets of the VIEs are receivables from us, 
we do not consolidate the VIEs even though we own all of the 
voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the 
obligations of the VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the 
third-party securities under certain circumstances. In our 
consolidated balance sheet we reported the debt securities 
issued to the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt with a 
carrying value of $398 million and $388 million at September 30, 
2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. See Note 16 
(Preferred Stock) for additional information about trust 
preferred securities.

Note 9:  Mortgage Banking Activities 

Mortgage banking activities consist of residential and 
commercial mortgage originations, sales and servicing. 

We apply the amortization method to commercial MSRs and 

apply the fair value method to residential MSRs. The amortized

Includes impacts associated with exercising cleanup calls on securitizations and our right to repurchase delinquent loans from GNMA loan securitization pools. MSRs may increase upon repurchase 
due to servicing liabilities associated with these delinquent GNMA loans. 
Includes sales and transfers of MSRs, which can result in an increase in MSRs if related to portfolios with servicing liabilities. In the first nine months of 2022, MSRs decreased $244 million due to the 
sale of interest-only strips in second quarter 2022 related to excess servicing cash flows from agency residential mortgage backed securitizations. 
Includes prepayment rate changes as well as other valuation changes due to changes in mortgage interest rates. 
Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs. 
In third quarter 2022, we enhanced our approach for estimating the discount rates to a more dynamic methodology for market curves and volatility, which had a nominal impact. 
Represents other changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions including prepayment rate estimation changes that are independent of mortgage interest rate changes. 
Represents the reduction in the MSR fair value for the cash flows expected to be collected during the period, net of income accreted due to the passage of time. 

Table 9.2 provides key weighted-average assumptions used 
in the valuation of residential MSRs and sensitivity of the current 
fair value of residential MSRs to immediate adverse changes in 
those assumptions. Amounts for residential MSRs include 

purchased servicing rights as well as servicing rights resulting 
from the transfer of loans. See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) for additional information on key assumptions for 
residential MSRs.

Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 

The sensitivities in the preceding table are hypothetical and 
caution should be exercised when relying on this data. Changes in 
value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be 
extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the 
assumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also, the 
effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the 

other interests held is calculated independently without changing 
any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may 
result in changes in others, which might magnify or counteract 
the sensitivities.

At September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had 
servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, 
of $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. As the servicer of 
loans for others, we advance certain payments of principal, 
interest, taxes, insurance, and default-related expenses which are 
generally reimbursed within a short timeframe from cash flows 
from the trust, GSEs, insurer or borrower. The credit risk related 
to these advances is limited since the reimbursement is generally 
senior to cash payments to investors. We also advance payments 
of taxes and insurance for our owned loans which are collectible

option trades. 
Represents recourse provided, predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. 
Includes indemnifications provided to certain third-party clearing agents. Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $138 million and $216 million with related collateral of $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion 
as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss 

that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical 
circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, 
where the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in 
Table 11.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could 
use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee 
agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of 
expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more 
representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum 
exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of 
the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if 
applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider 
the credit risk of the related contingent obligation. 

For our guarantees other than written options, non-

investment grade represents those guarantees on which we have 
a higher risk of performance under the terms of the guarantee, 
which is determined based on an external rating or an internal 
credit grade that is below investment grade. For written options, 
non-investment grade represents those guarantees where the 
current intrinsic values would require us to perform under the 
contract. 

MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES  We provide debit and credit 
card transaction processing services through payment networks 
directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing 
servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is 
accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the 
merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in 
connection with payment and delivery disputes between the 
merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the 
cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We 
estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total 
merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four 
months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back 
transaction. As of September 30, 2022, our potential maximum 
exposure was approximately $749.9 billion, and related losses, 
including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. 

GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES  The Parent fully and 
unconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, 
and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 
100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may 
issue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary 
of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $1.0 billion and 
$1.2 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 
respectively. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the 
Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

Note 11:  Guarantees and Other Commitments (continued) 

OTHER COMMITMENTS  To meet the financing needs of our 
customers, we may enter into commitments to purchase debt 
and equity securities to provide capital for their funding, liquidity 
or other future needs. As of September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, we had commitments to purchase debt 
securities of $165 million and $18 million, respectively, and 
commitments to purchase equity securities of $3.0 billion and 
$2.4 billion, respectively. 

As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing 

organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity 
to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen 
events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these 
obligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and 
accordingly are included in Table 11.1 in Other guarantees and 
indemnifications. 

Also, we have commitments to purchase loans and securities 

under resale agreements from certain counterparties, including 
central clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded 
contractual commitments was $11.9 billion and $11.0 billion as 
of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded 

from Table 4.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 4 
(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).

Note 12:  Pledged Assets and Collateral 

Pledged Assets 
Table 12.1 provides the carrying amount of on-balance sheet 
pledged assets, as well as the fair value of other pledged 
collateral not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet, 
which we have received from third parties, have the right to 
repledge, and have repledged. 

TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY  Our trading businesses may pledge 
debt and equity securities in connection with securities sold 
under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and 
securities lending arrangements. The collateral that we pledge 
related to our trading activities may include our own collateral as 
well as collateral that we have received from third parties and 
have the right to repledge. All of the collateral we pledge related 
to trading activity is eligible to be repledged or sold by the 
secured party. 

NON-TRADING RELATED ACTIVITY  As part of our liquidity 
management strategy, we may pledge loans, debt securities, and

Securities Financing Activities 
We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities 
borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities 
financing activities”) typically to finance trading positions 
(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover 
short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing 
needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are 
conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser 
extent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing 
activities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as 
U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, 
to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity 
securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We 
account for these transactions as collateralized financings in 
which we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We 
believe these financing transactions generally do not have 
material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related 
monitoring processes. 

other financial assets to secure trust and public deposits, 
borrowings and letters of credit from Federal Home Loan Banks 
(FHLBs) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (FRB) and for other purposes as required or permitted by 
law or insurance statutory requirements. Substantially all of the 
non-trading activity pledged collateral is not eligible to be 
repledged or sold by the secured party. 

VIE RELATED  We pledge assets in connection with various types 
of transactions entered into with VIEs. These pledged assets can 
only be used to settle the liabilities of those entities. 

We also have loans recorded on our consolidated balance 

sheet which represent certain delinquent loans that are eligible 
for repurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. See Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for additional 
information on consolidated VIE assets.

OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES  Table 12.2 
presents resale and repurchase agreements subject to master 
repurchase agreements (MRA) and securities borrowing and 
lending agreements subject to master securities lending 
agreements (MSLA). Collateralized financings, and those with a 
single counterparty, are presented net on our consolidated 
balance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit 
balance sheet netting. The majority of transactions subject to 
these agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not 
eligible for balance sheet netting. 

Collateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, 
such as securities or loans, and is not netted on the consolidated 
balance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we received 
includes securities or loans and is not recognized on our 
consolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may 
be increased or decreased over time to maintain certain 
contractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each 
arrangement fluctuate in value. Generally, these agreements 
require collateral to exceed the asset or liability recognized on

collateral pledged or received related to exposures subject to 
enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements are 
typically over-collateralized, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure in this 
table to limit the reported amount of such collateral to the 

amount of the related recognized asset or liability for each

Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject to enforceable MRAs that have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Includes $55.8 billion and $66.2 billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 
2021, respectively. Also includes securities purchased under long-term resale agreements (generally one year or more) classified in loans, which totaled $23.1 billion and $22.9 billion, at 
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
Represents the fair value of collateral we have received under enforceable MRAs or MSLAs, limited in the table above to the amount of the recognized asset due from each counterparty. At 
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we have received total collateral with a fair value of $128.0 billion and $124.4 billion, respectively, all of which we have the right to sell or repledge. 
These amounts include securities we have sold or repledged to others with a fair value of $35.3 billion and $28.8 billion at September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
Represents the amount of our exposure (assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is not collateralized and/or is not subject to an enforceable MRA or MSLA. 
Amount is classified in short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. 
Represents the fair value of collateral we have pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs, limited in the table above to the amount of the recognized liability owed to each counterparty. At 
September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we have pledged total collateral with a fair value of $54.9 billion and $35.9 billion, respectively, substantially all of which may be sold or repledged by 
the counterparty. 

REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS  Securities 
sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending 
arrangements are effectively short-term collateralized 
borrowings. In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange 
for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an 
obligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s 
maturity. These types of transactions create risks, including 
(1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, 
(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below 
the amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and 
therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional 
amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity 
on demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to 
contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in 
various ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid 
securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial 
strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of 
collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase 
amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned 
through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our 
cash repayment. Table 12.3 provides the gross amounts 
recognized on the consolidated balance sheet (before the effects 
of offsetting) of our liabilities for repurchase and securities 
lending agreements disaggregated by underlying collateral type.

Securities lending is executed under agreements that allow either party to terminate the transaction without notice, while repurchase agreements have a term structure to them that technically 
matures at a point in time. The overnight/continuous repurchase agreements require election of both parties to roll the trade rather than the election to terminate the arrangement as in securities 
lending.

Note 13:  Legal Actions 

Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a 
number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and 
other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising 
from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those 
proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential 
financial loss or other adverse consequences. These proceedings 
and investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo 
and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related 
matters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our 
subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our 
subsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or 
otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct 
of investigations of other persons or industry groups. 

We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses 

associated with the actions become probable and the costs can 
be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the 
amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of 
potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if 
we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low 
end of the range of those potential losses. There can be no 
assurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including 
the matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving 
legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the 
amounts accrued for those actions. 

ATM ACCESS FEE LITIGATION  In October 2011, plaintiffs filed a 
putative class action, Mackmin, et al. v. Visa, Inc. et al., against 
Wells Fargo & Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Visa, 
MasterCard, and several other banks in the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that the Visa 
and MasterCard requirement that if an ATM operator charges an 
access fee on Visa and MasterCard transactions, then that fee 
cannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions 
on other networks, violates antitrust rules. Plaintiffs seek treble 
damages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees where 
available under federal and state law. Two other antitrust cases 
that make similar allegations were filed in the same court, but 
these cases did not name Wells Fargo as a defendant. On 
February 13, 2013, the district court granted defendants’ 
motions to dismiss the three actions. Plaintiffs appealed the 
dismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the district 
court’s decisions and remanded the three cases to the district 
court for further proceedings. On June 28, 2016, the United 
States Supreme Court granted defendants’ petitions for writ of 
certiorari to review the decisions of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia. On November 17, 2016, the 
United States Supreme Court dismissed the petitions as 
improvidently granted, and the three cases returned to the 
district court for further proceedings. In November 2021, the 
district court granted preliminary approval of an agreement 
pursuant to which the Company will pay $20.8 million in order to 
resolve the cases. In August 2022, the district court granted final 
approval of the settlement. 

AUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS  On April 20, 2018, the Company 
entered into consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things, investigations by 
the agencies into the Company’s compliance risk management 
program and its past practices involving certain automobile 
collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain 

mortgage interest rate lock extensions. The consent orders 
require remediation to customers and the payment of a total of 
$1.0 billion in civil money penalties to the agencies. In July 2017, 
the Company announced a plan to remediate customers who 
may have been financially harmed due to issues related to 
automobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor 
on their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among 
other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI 
policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into 
one multi-district litigation in the United States District Court 
for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the 
Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district 
litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class 
action against the Company and its executive officers alleging 
material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related 
information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020, 
the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the 
Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to 
two alleged misstatements. In addition, the Company was 
subject to a class action in the United States District Court for 
the Central District of California alleging that customers were 
entitled to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed 
automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements 
between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender. 
As previously disclosed, the Company entered into a settlement 
to resolve the class action. Allegations related to the CPI and GAP 
programs were among the subjects of a shareholder derivative 
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of California, which has been dismissed. In addition, 
federal and state government agencies, including the CFPB, have 
undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations, or 
examinations regarding these and other issues related to the 
origination, servicing, and collection of consumer auto loans, 
including related insurance products. The Company is in 
resolution discussions with the CFPB regarding a number of 
CFPB investigations, inquiries, and other matters, including 
automobile lending matters, consumer deposit account related 
matters, and mortgage lending matters. There can be no 
assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. As previously 
disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve 
investigations by state attorneys general. 

COMMERCIAL LENDING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION  In October and 
November 2020, plaintiffs filed two putative securities fraud 
class actions, which were consolidated into one lawsuit pending in 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
California alleging that the Company and certain of its current 
and former officers made false and misleading statements or 
omissions regarding, among other things, the Company’s 
commercial lending underwriting practices, the credit quality of 
its commercial credit portfolios, and the value of its commercial 
loans, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-
backed securities. In May 2022, the district court granted 
defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was appealed to 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 

COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS  Federal government agencies, 
including the United States Department of Labor (Department 
of Labor), are reviewing certain transactions associated with the 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company’s 
401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan 
purchased certain securities used in connection with the

Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. On September 12, 
2022, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement 
with the Department of Labor whereby the Company agreed to 
pay approximately $13.2 million to the Department of Labor and 
approximately $131.8 million to eligible current and former 
Company 401(k) plan participants in order to resolve the 
Department of Labor’s review. As part of the settlement with the 
Department of Labor, the Company also agreed to redeem 
certain preferred securities held by the Company’s 401(k) plan in 
exchange for shares of the Company’s common stock. On 
September 26, 2022, participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan 
filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for 
the District of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection 
with certain of these transactions. 

CONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION  Wells Fargo 
shareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action 
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York alleging that the Company and certain of its current 
and former executive officers and directors made false or 
misleading statements regarding the Company’s efforts to 
comply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal 
Reserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB 
and OCC. Allegations related to the Company’s efforts to comply 
with these three consent orders are also among the subjects of a 
shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in California state court. 

CONSUMER DEPOSIT ACCOUNT RELATED REGULATORY 
INVESTIGATIONS  The CFPB is conducting an investigation into 
whether customers were unduly harmed by the Company’s 
historical practices associated with the freezing (and, in many 
cases, closing) of consumer deposit accounts after the Company 
detected suspected fraudulent activity (by third parties or 
account holders) that affected those accounts. The CFPB is also 
investigating certain of the Company’s past disclosures to 
customers regarding the minimum qualifying debit card usage 
required for customers to receive a waiver of monthly service 
fees on certain consumer deposit accounts. The Company is in 
resolution discussions with the CFPB regarding a number of 
CFPB investigations, inquiries, and other matters, including 
automobile lending matters, consumer deposit account related 
matters, and mortgage lending matters. There can be no 
assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. 

HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS  Government agencies, including the 
United States Department of Justice and the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or 
informal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company’s 
hiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud 
class action has also been filed in the United States District Court 
for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company 
and certain of its executive officers made false or misleading 
statements about the Company’s hiring practices related to 
diversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices 
related to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder 
derivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for 
the Northern District of California. 

INTERCHANGE LITIGATION  Plaintiffs representing a class of 
merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual 
merchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and 
Wachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated 
with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, 

MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding 
companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These 
actions have been consolidated in the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and 
consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based 
on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks 
damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege 
that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully 
colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that 
enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged 
tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are 
anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other 
defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment 
Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other 
entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the 
Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and 
the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed 
a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to 
resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate 
settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The 
settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the 
consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately 
$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants 
opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided 
for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of 
default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period 
of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final 
approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement 
objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the 
settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On 
June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement 
agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action 
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior 
class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, 
seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second 
Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, 
2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead 
class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. 
The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve 
the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants 
will pay a total of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes 
approximately $5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 
settlement and $900 million in additional funding. The 
Company’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is 
approximately $94.5 million. The court granted final approval of 
the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was appealed to 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by 
settlement objector merchants. On September 27, 2021, the 
district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification 
in the equitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct 
action litigations have been settled while others remain pending. 

MORTGAGE LENDING MATTERS  Plaintiffs representing a class of 
mortgage borrowers filed separate putative class actions alleging 
that Wells Fargo improperly denied mortgage loan modifications 
or repayment plans to customers in the foreclosure process due 
to the overstatement of foreclosure attorneys’ fees that were 
included for purposes of determining whether a customer in the 
foreclosure process qualified for a mortgage loan modification or 
repayment plan. As previously disclosed, the Company entered 
into settlements to resolve the class actions, while the others 
were voluntarily dismissed. In addition, federal and state 
government agencies, including the CFPB, have undertaken

Note 13:  Legal Actions (continued) 

formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding these and 
other mortgage servicing matters. The Company is in resolution 
discussions with the CFPB regarding a number of CFPB 
investigations, inquiries, and other matters, including automobile 
lending matters, consumer deposit account related matters, and 
mortgage lending matters. There can be no assurance as to the 
outcome of these discussions. On September 9, 2021, the OCC 
assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the Company 
regarding loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home 
Lending business and insufficient progress in addressing 
requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order. In 
addition, on September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a 
consent order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve 
the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. 

NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION  In August 
2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc. (Nomura) 
and Natixis Real Estate Holdings, LLC (Natixis) filed a total of 
seven third-party complaints against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in 
New York state court. In the underlying first-party actions, 
Nomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of 
representations and warranties made in connection with 
residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In 
the third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that 
Wells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities 
administrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own 
breaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and 
failed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis 
additionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default 
oversight duties. In March 2022, Wells Fargo entered into an 
agreement to settle the six actions filed by Nomura, and the 
actions have been voluntarily dismissed. In the remaining action 
filed by Natixis, Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging 
that Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of its 
representation and warranty breaches. 

OFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION  The Company has self-identified 
an issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo 
software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related 
financing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States 
Department of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related 
to these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as 
a result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made 
voluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and has been cooperating 
with investigations or inquiries arising out of this matter by 
federal government agencies. The Company is in resolution 
discussions with certain of these agencies, although there can be 
no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. 

RETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS  Federal and state government 
agencies, including the United States Department of Justice 
(Department of Justice) and the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken formal or informal 
inquiries or investigations arising out of certain retail sales 
practices of the Company that were the subject of settlements 
with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City 
Attorney announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. On 
February 21, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with 
the Department of Justice to resolve the Department of Justice’s 
criminal investigation into the Company’s retail sales practices, as 
well as a separate agreement to resolve the Department of 
Justice’s civil investigation. As part of the Department of Justice 
criminal settlement, no charges will be filed against the Company 

provided the Company abides by all the terms of the agreement. 
The Department of Justice criminal settlement also includes the 
Company’s agreement that the facts set forth in the settlement 
document constitute sufficient facts for the finding of criminal 
violations of statutes regarding bank records and personal 
information. On February 21, 2020, the Company also entered 
into an order to resolve the SEC’s investigation arising out of the 
Company’s retail sales practices. The SEC order contains a 
finding, to which the Company consented, that the facts set 
forth include violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. As part of the 
resolution of the Department of Justice and SEC investigations, 
the Company made payments totaling $3.0 billion. The Company 
has also entered into agreements to resolve other government 
agency investigations, including investigations by the state 
attorneys general. In addition, a number of lawsuits were filed by 
non-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies 
related to these retail sales practices. As previously disclosed, the 
Company entered into various settlements to resolve these 
lawsuits. 

RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION  In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF 
Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a 
complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising 
similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the 
Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB 
Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the 
plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused 
losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based 
upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify 
and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for 
purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify 
investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate 
standards of care following alleged events of default. In 
July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light’s claims and 
certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and 
subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and 
Commerzbank AG appealed the district court’s decision to the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The 
Company previously settled two class actions filed by 
institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit 
Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park 
Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed complaints that were 
consolidated in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning 
of defective mortgage loan documentation. 

SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION  The Seminole Tribe of 
Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that 
Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with 
the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the 
assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended 
to include three individual current and former beneficiaries as 
plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. 
Wells Fargo filed a petition to remove the case to federal court.

OUTLOOK  As described above, the Company establishes accruals 
for legal actions when potential losses associated with the 
actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably 
estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible 
potential losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable 
and estimable losses was approximately $3.7 billion as of 
September 30, 2022. The outcomes of legal actions are 
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is 
inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or 
even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the 
amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is 
probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. 
Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established 
accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on 
information currently available, advice of counsel, available 
insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo 
believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells 
Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the 
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s 
consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the 
ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material 
to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.

amounts and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative 
transactions can be measured in terms of the notional amount, 
but this amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is 
generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined.

In first quarter 2022, we prospectively reclassified certain equity securities and related economic hedge derivatives from "not held for trading activities" to "held for trading activities" to better reflect 
the business activity of those financial instruments. For additional information on Trading Activities, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative 
exposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each 
counterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using 
master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral. In addition 
to the netting amounts included in the table, we also have 
balance sheet netting related to resale and repurchase 
agreements that are disclosed within Note 12 (Pledged Assets 
and Collateral). 

Table 14.2 provides information on the fair values of 
derivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master 
netting arrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments 
and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our 
consolidated balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral 
associated with such arrangements. We execute substantially all 
of our derivative transactions under master netting 
arrangements and reflect all derivative balances and related cash 
collateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on 
a net basis within our consolidated balance sheet. We determine 
the balance sheet netting adjustments based on the terms 
specified within each master netting arrangement, which are 
determined at the counterparty level. On our consolidated 
balance sheet we do not net non-cash collateral that we receive 
or pledge. For disclosure purposes, we present “Total Derivatives, 
net” which represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each 
counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting

Represents amounts with counterparties subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that have been offset in our consolidated balance sheet, including portfolio level counterparty valuation 
adjustments related to customer accommodation and other trading derivatives. Counterparty valuation adjustments related to derivative assets were $396 million and $284 million and debit 
valuation adjustments related to derivative liabilities were $497 million and $158 million as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, and were primarily related to interest rate 
contracts. 

Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges 
For fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert 
certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of 
deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate 
risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency 
interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure 
to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the 
issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also 
enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap 
contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical 
commodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use 
interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency 
interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against 
changes in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale 
debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency 
rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency 
risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to 
changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other 
comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other 
Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other 
comprehensive income. 

For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge 
the variability in interest payments received on certain interest-
earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial 
loans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to 
changes in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use 
cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments 
on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due 
to changes in foreign exchange rates. 

We estimate $491 million pre-tax of deferred net losses 
related to cash flow hedges in OCI at September 30, 2022, will be 
reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve 
months. For cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2022, we are 
hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the 
variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for 
a maximum of 10 years. For additional information on our 
accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Does not include the carrying amount of hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk. The carrying amount excluded for debt securities is $699 million and for long-
term debt is $0 million as of September 30, 2022, and $873 million for debt securities and $(2.7) billion for long-term debt as of December 31, 2021. 
Represents the full carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability item as of the balance sheet date, except for circumstances in which only a portion of the asset or liability was designated as the 
hedged item in which case only the portion designated is presented. 
The balance includes $41 million and $248 million of debt securities and long-term debt cumulative basis adjustments as of September 30, 2022, respectively, and $136 million and $188 million of 
debt securities and long-term debt cumulative basis adjustments as of December 31, 2021, respectively, on terminated hedges whereby the hedged items have subsequently been re-designated 
into existing hedges. 
Carrying amount represents the amortized cost. 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include 
economic hedges and derivatives entered into for customer 
accommodation trading purposes. 

We use economic hedge derivatives to manage our exposure 

to interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign currency risk, and 
credit risk. We also use economic hedge derivatives to mitigate 
the periodic earnings volatility caused by mismatches between 
the changes in fair value of the hedged item and hedging 
instrument recognized on our fair value accounting hedges. 
Changes in the fair values of derivatives used to economically 
hedge the deferred compensation plan are reported in personnel 
expense. 

For additional information on economic hedges and other

(1)  Mortgage banking amounts for third quarter and first nine months of 2022 are comprised of gains (losses) of $(863) million and $(3.5) billion, respectively, related to derivatives used as economic 

hedges of MSRs measured at fair value offset by gains (losses) of $568 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, related to derivatives used as economic hedges of mortgage loans held for sale and 
derivative loan commitments. The corresponding amounts for third quarter and first nine months of 2021 are comprised of gains (losses) of $(176) million and $(1.1) billion offset by gains (losses) of 
$142 million and $987 million, respectively. 
In first quarter 2022, we prospectively reclassified certain equity securities and related economic hedge derivatives from “not held for trading activities” to “held for trading activities” to better 
reflect the business activity of those financial instruments. For additional information on Trading Activities, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Note 14:  Derivatives (continued) 

Credit Derivatives 
Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is 
derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or 
entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to 
another party (the seller of credit protection). We generally use 
credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk 
management objectives by purchasing and selling credit 
protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of 
credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help 
manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to 
perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of 
default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include 
events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of 
principal and/or interest payment. 

Table 14.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives.

Protection sold represents the estimated maximum 
exposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of 
default, the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of 
recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from 
collateral held or any economic hedges. 

The amounts under non-investment grade represent the 
notional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a 
higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the 
credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. 

We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets 

under the credit derivative have an external rating that is 
investment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify 
the credit derivative as non-investment grade. 

Our maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is 
managed through posted collateral and purchased credit 
derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order 
to achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk 
management is designed to provide an ability to recover a 
significant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold 
credit derivatives. 

Credit-Risk Contingent Features 
Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if 
the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain 
major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand 
additional collateral or require termination or replacement of 
derivative instruments in a net liability position. Table 14.8 
illustrates our exposure to OTC bilateral derivative contracts with 
credit-risk contingent features, collateral we have posted, and 
the additional collateral we would be required to post if the credit 
rating of our debt was downgraded below investment grade.

Note 15:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure 
requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading 
or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. 
Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments 
on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments 
typically involve application of lower of cost or fair value 
(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or 
application of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable 
equity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring 
basis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in 
Table 15.8 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that 
are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities 
carried at amortized cost. 

See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in 

our 2021 Form 10-K for discussion of how we determine fair 
value. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for 
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or 
nonrecurring basis, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We classify our assets and liabilities 
recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value 
hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations 
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the 
lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on 
significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2021 Form 10-K for a 
detailed description of the fair value hierarchy. 

In the determination of the classification of financial 
instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we 
consider all available information, including observable market 
data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our 
understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific 
facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument 
category and judgments are made regarding the significance of 
the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are 
considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. 
We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the 
fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value 
(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to 
measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published

Includes net gains (losses) included in both net income and other comprehensive income. All amounts represent net gains (losses) included in net income except for $(9) million and $(36) million and 
included in other comprehensive income from AFS debt securities for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively. The corresponding amounts for the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2021 were $(2) million and $34 million, respectively. 
Includes originations of mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale. 
All assets and liabilities transferred into Level 3 were previously classified within Level 2. 
All assets and liabilities transferred out of Level 3 are classified as Level 2. During first quarter 2022, we transferred $8.9 billion of non-marketable equity securities and $1.4 billion of related 
economic hedging derivative assets (equity contracts) out of Level 3 due to our election to measure fair value of these instruments as a portfolio. Under this election, the unit of valuation is the 
portfolio-level, rather than each individual instrument. The unobservable inputs previously significant to the valuation of the instruments individually are no longer significant, as those unobservable 
inputs offset under the portfolio election. 
Includes net unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at period end included in both net income and other comprehensive income. All amounts represent net unrealized gains 
(losses) included in net income except for $5 million and $(3) million included in other comprehensive income from AFS debt securities for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, 
respectively. 
Included in net gains from trading and securities in the consolidated statement of income. 
Included in mortgage banking income in the consolidated statement of income. 
For additional information on the changes in mortgage servicing rights, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities). 
Included in mortgage banking income, net gains from trading and securities, and other noninterest income in the consolidated statement of income.

Note 15:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

Table 15.3 provides quantitative information about the 
valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of our Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. 

The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets 
inherent in the fair values obtained from third-party vendors are 
not included in the table, as the specific inputs applied are not 

provided by the vendor (for additional information on vendor-
developed valuations, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) in our 2021 Form 10-K). 

Weighted averages of inputs are calculated using 

outstanding unpaid principal balance for cash instruments, such 
as loans and securities, and notional amounts for derivative 
instruments.

The high end of the range of inputs is for servicing modified loans. For non-modified loans the range is $52 - $181 at September 30, 2022, and $54 - $199 at December 31, 2021. 
Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 
Consists of total Level 3 assets of $12.9 billion and $19.6 billion and total Level 3 liabilities of $4.5 billion and $2.6 billion, before netting of derivative balances, at September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, respectively. 

For additional information on the valuation techniques and 

significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of our Level 
3 assets and liabilities, including how changes in these inputs 

affect fair value estimates, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) in our 2021 Form 10-K).

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain 
assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with 
GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from 
application of LOCOM accounting, write-downs of individual 
assets, or application of the measurement alternative for 
nonmarketable equity securities. 

Table 15.4:  Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 

Table 15.4 provides the fair value hierarchy and fair value at 
the date of the nonrecurring fair value adjustment for all assets 
that were still held as of September 30, 2022, and December 31, 
2021, and for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was 
recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, 
and year ended December 31, 2021.

Includes impairment of nonmarketable equity securities and observable price changes 
related to nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement 
alternative. 
Includes impairment of operating lease ROU assets, valuation of physical commodities, 
valuation losses on foreclosed real estate and other collateral owned, and impairment of 
private equity and venture capital investments in consolidated portfolio companies. 

Table 15.6 provides quantitative information about the 
valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of our Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value 
on a nonrecurring basis and determined using an internal model. 
The table is limited to financial instruments that had 
nonrecurring fair value adjustments during the periods 
presented. Weighted averages of inputs are calculated using 
outstanding unpaid principal balance for cash instruments, such 
as loans, and carrying value prior to the nonrecurring fair value 
measurement for nonmarketable equity securities and private 
equity and venture capital investments in consolidated portfolio

See Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) in our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information on the valuation technique and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of Level 3 
assets. 
Consists of approximately $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion of government insured/guaranteed loans purchased from GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations at September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, respectively, and approximately $200 million of other mortgage loans that are not government insured/guaranteed at both September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 
Applies only to non-government insured/guaranteed loans. 
Includes the impact on prepayment rate of expected defaults for government insured/guaranteed loans, which impact the frequency and timing of early resolution of loans. 
Represents private equity and venture capital investments in consolidated portfolio companies. 

Fair Value Option 
The fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only 
permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, 
to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with 
changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair 
value option to align the measurement model with how the 
financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity 
or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the 
portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. For 
additional information, including the basis for our fair value 

Table 15.7:  Fair Value Option 

option elections, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Table 15.7 reflects differences between the fair value 
carrying amount of the assets for which we have elected the fair 
value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal 
amount at maturity. Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more 
past due and still accruing included in LHFS for which we have 
elected the fair value option were insignificant at September 30, 
2022, and December 31, 2021.

The changes in fair value related to initial measurement and 

subsequent changes in fair value included in earnings for LHFS 
accounted for under the fair value option were $(146) million and 
$(739) million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, 
respectively, and $495 million and $1.7 billion in the third quarter 
and first nine months of 2021, respectively. Substantially all of 
these amounts were included in the mortgage banking 
noninterest income line of the consolidated statement of 
income. For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk 
gains or losses were derived principally by determining the 
change in fair value of the loans due to changes in the observable 
or implied credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the 
loans less the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. For 

nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Gains and losses attributable to 
instrument-specific credit risk related to assets accounted for 
under the fair value option in the third quarter and first nine 
months of both 2022 and 2021, were insignificant.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Table 15.8 presents a summary of fair value estimates for 
financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on a 
recurring basis. Some financial instruments are excluded from 
the scope of this table, such as certain insurance contracts, 
certain nonmarketable equity securities, and leases. This table 
also excludes assets and liabilities that are not financial 
instruments such as the value of the long-term relationships with 
our deposit, credit card and trust customers, MSRs, premises and 
equipment, goodwill and deferred taxes. 

Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and 
commercial and similar letters of credit are not included in 
Table 15.8. A reasonable estimate of the fair value of these 
instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the 
allowance for unfunded credit commitments, which totaled 
$800 million and $1.4 billion at September 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021, respectively. 

The total of the fair value calculations presented does not 

represent, and should not be construed to represent, the 
underlying fair value of the Company.

ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  All shares of 
our ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (ESOP 
Preferred Stock) were issued to a trustee acting on behalf of the 
Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). Dividends 
on the ESOP Preferred Stock are cumulative from the date of 
initial issuance and are payable quarterly at annual rates based 
upon the year of issuance. Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock 
released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan is 
converted into shares of our common stock based on the stated 
value of the ESOP Preferred Stock and the then current market 
price of our common stock. The ESOP Preferred Stock is also 

convertible at the option of the holder at any time, unless 
previously redeemed. We have the option to redeem the ESOP 
Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption 
price per share equal to the higher of (a) $1,000 per share plus 
accrued and unpaid dividends or (b) the fair market value, as 
defined in the Certificates of Designation for the ESOP Preferred 
Stock. 

In October 2022, we redeemed all outstanding shares of our 

ESOP Preferred Stock in exchange for shares of the Company’s 
common stock. The redemption price was based on a fair market 
value of $618 million.

Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are 
included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

Note 18:  Employee Benefits and Expenses 

Pension and Postretirement Plans 
We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit 
retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan 
(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of 
Wells Fargo. The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009, 
and no new benefits accrue after that date. For additional 
information on our pension and postretirement plans, including 
plan assumptions, investment strategy and asset allocation, 
projected benefit payments, and valuation methodologies used 
for assets measured at fair value, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 21 (Employee Benefits 
and Other Expenses) in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

We recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan 

based on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments 
will, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual 
service and interest cost (threshold). Settlement losses of 
$48 million and $151 million were recognized during the third 
quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, compared 
with $35 million and $97 million, respectively, for the same 
periods a year ago, representing the pro rata portion of the net 
loss in AOCI based on the percentage reduction in the Cash 
Balance Plan’s projected benefit obligation attributable to lump 
sum benefit payments during the first nine months of 2022 and

Expenses 
Regulatory Charges and Assessments expense, which is included 
in other noninterest expense, was $207 million and $640 million 
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, respectively, 
compared with $213 million and $622 million in the same 
periods a year ago, and primarily consisted of Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit assessment expense. 

2021. As a result of the settlement losses, we remeasured the 
Cash Balance Plan obligation and plan assets as of both 
September 30, 2022 and 2021, and used a discount rate of 
5.44% and 2.80%, respectively. In the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2022, respectively, the result of the settlement losses 
and remeasurements was: 
• 

a decrease of $143 million and $253 million in the Cash 
Balance Plan asset; and 
• 
a decrease of $95 million and $102 million in OCI (pre-tax). 
In the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, the result of 
the settlement losses and remeasurement was: 
• 

a decrease of $224 million and increase of $123 million in 
the Cash Balance Plan asset; and 
a decrease of $189 million and increase of $220 million in 
OCI (pre-tax). 

• 

Table 18.1 presents the components of net periodic benefit 

cost. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and 
interest cost discount rate in determining net periodic benefit 
cost for third quarter 2022 were 5.34% and 4.48%, respectively. 
Service cost is reported in personnel expense and all other 
components of net periodic benefit cost are reported in other 
noninterest expense on the consolidated statement of income.

We may incur expenses related to a variety of loss 
contingencies, such as customer remediation activities. We 
establish an accrued liability when a loss event is probable and 
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In third 
quarter 2022, we recognized $2.0 billion of accruals primarily 
related to a variety of historical matters, including litigation, 
customer remediation, and regulatory matters, which were 
included in operating losses. See Note 13 (Legal Actions) for 
additional information on accruals for legal actions.

Note 19:  Restructuring Charges 

The Company began pursuing various initiatives to reduce 
expenses and create a more efficient and streamlined 
organization in third quarter 2020. Actions from these initiatives 
included (i) reorganizing and simplifying business processes and 
structures to improve internal operations and the customer 
experience, (ii) reducing headcount, (iii) optimizing third-party 
spending, including for our technology infrastructure, and (iv) 
rationalizing our branch and administrative locations, which may 
include consolidations and closures. Substantially all of the 
restructuring charges were personnel expenses related to 
severance costs associated with headcount reductions with 

Table 19.1:  Accruals for Restructuring Charges 

(in millions) 

Balance, beginning of period 

Restructuring charges 

Changes in estimates 

Payments and utilization 

Balance, end of period 

payments made over time in accordance with our severance plan, 
as well as payments for other employee benefit costs such as 
incentive compensation. 

Restructuring charges are recorded as a component of 
noninterest expense on our consolidated statement of income. 
Changes in estimates represent adjustments to noninterest 
expense based on refinements to previously estimated amounts, 
which may reflect trends such as higher voluntary employee 
attrition, as well as changes in business activities. 

Table 19.1 provides details on our restructuring charges.

Substantially all of the amounts for fair value hedges are foreign exchange contracts. 
Substantially all of the amounts for cash flow hedges are interest rate contracts. 
AOCI related to debt securities includes after-tax unrealized gains or losses associated with the transfer of securities from AFS to HTM of $3.6 billion and $817 million at September 30, 2022, and

Note 22:  Operating Segments 

Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. We define our 
reportable operating segments by type of product and customer 
segment, and their results are based on our management 
reporting process. The management reporting process measures 
the performance of the reportable operating segments based on 
the Company’s management structure, and the results are 
regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and Operating 
Committee. The management reporting process is based on U.S. 
GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer 
pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenues and 
expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently 
reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which 
allows management to assess performance consistently across 
the operating segments. 

Consumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial 
products and services for consumers and small businesses with 
annual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products 
and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and 
debit cards, as well as home, auto, personal, and small business 
lending. 

Commercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, 
family owned and certain public companies. Products and 
services include banking and credit products across multiple 
industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease 
products, and treasury management. 

Corporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital 
markets, banking, and financial products and services to 
corporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional 
clients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, 
investment banking, treasury management, commercial real 
estate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions, 
as well as sales, trading, and research capabilities. 

Wealth and Investment Management provides personalized 
wealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, 
private banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to 
affluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We 
operate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth 
offices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and 
digitally through WellsTrade® and Intuitive Investor®. 

Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, 
net of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, 
liquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable 
operating segments, as well as our investment portfolio and 
affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In 
addition, Corporate includes all restructuring charges related to 
our efficiency initiatives. See Note 19 (Restructuring Charges) 
for additional information on restructuring charges. Corporate 
also includes certain lines of business that management has 
determined are no longer consistent with the long-term 
strategic goals of the Company, as well as results for previously 
divested businesses. 

Basis of Presentation 
FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

REVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results.

(1) 

Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax 
credits for low-income housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are 
included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results. 

(2)  Net interest income is interest earned on assets minus the interest paid on liabilities to fund those assets. Segment interest earned includes actual interest income on segment assets as well as a 

funding credit for their deposits. Segment interest paid on liabilities includes actual interest expense on segment liabilities as well as a funding charge for their assets.

Note 23:  Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by 
federal banking regulators. The FRB establishes capital 
requirements for the consolidated financial holding company, 
and the OCC has similar requirements for the Company’s 
national banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). 
Table 23.1 presents regulatory capital information for 
Wells Fargo & Company and the Bank in accordance with Basel III 
capital requirements. We must calculate our risk-based capital 

ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
The Standardized Approach applies assigned risk weights to 
broad risk categories, while the calculation of risk-weighted 
assets (RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by requiring 
applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which 
relies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an 
operational risk component. 

At September 30, 2022, the Bank and our other insured 

depository institutions were considered well-capitalized under 
the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches at September 30, 2022. 
The SLR consists of tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of total average assets, less goodwill and other permitted tier 1 capital deductions (net of 
deferred tax liabilities), plus certain off-balance sheet exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

At September 30, 2022, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), 

tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the Company 
included a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge 
of 1.50%. The G-SIB surcharge is not applicable to the Bank. In 
addition, the CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for 
the Company included a stress capital buffer of 3.10% under the 
Standardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of 
2.50% under the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio 
requirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer 
of 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced 
Approaches. The Company is required to maintain these risk-
based capital ratios and to maintain an SLR of at least 5.00% 
(composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Bank 
is required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered 
well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy 
rules. 

Capital Planning Requirements 
The FRB’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain large bank holding 
companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB conducts an 
annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and 
has also published guidance regarding its supervisory 
expectations for capital planning, including capital policies 
regarding the process relating to common stock dividend and 
repurchase decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18. The Parent’s 
ability to make certain capital distributions is subject to the 
requirements of the capital plan rule and is also subject to the 
Parent meeting or exceeding certain regulatory capital 
minimums.

Loan and Dividend Restrictions 
Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit 
and non-credit transactions between a bank and its nonbank 
affiliates. Additionally, federal laws and regulations limit the 
dividends that a national bank may pay. 

Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal 

and state statutory provisions and regulations covering the 
amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year. In 
addition, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as 
amended and restated on June 26, 2019, among Wells Fargo & 
Company, the parent holding company (Parent), WFC Holdings, 
LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the 
Parent (IHC), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, 
Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries 
of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities 
for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time 
as related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be 
restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if 
certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers 
or if the Parent’s Board authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. 

For additional information on loan and dividend 

restrictions, see Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and 
Other Restrictions) in our 2021 Form 10-K.
