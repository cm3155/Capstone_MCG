This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2021 Form 10-K).

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one 
in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses 
in the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the 
U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and 
mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance, through our four reportable operating 
segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, 
Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment 
Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 41 on Fortune’s 2022 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at June 30, 2022. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control 

infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The 
Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or 
delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or 
delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on 
others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory 
action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, 
enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which 
could be significant. While we still have significant work to do, the 
Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to 
operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the 
highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in 
place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 

and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second 
third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy 
and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet 
satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we 
believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other 
enforcement actions. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a 
$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to 
insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s 
April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the 
Company’s Home Lending business. 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the 
execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party

In preparation for the cessation of the various LIBOR 

settings, we have undertaken a variety of activities. Among other 
things, we proactively implemented internal “stop-sell” dates to 
discontinue offering products referencing LIBOR except 
pursuant to limited exceptions consistent with regulatory 
guidance. At the same time, we expanded our suite of product 
offerings that are indexed to alternative reference rates. 

We also continue to transition our legacy LIBOR contracts to 

alternative reference rates. We transitioned substantially all of 
our legacy contracts with LIBOR settings impacted by the 
December 31, 2021, cessation date to alternative reference 
rates, and we will continue to address contracts with LIBOR 
settings that are impacted by the June 30, 2023, cessation date. 

In first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act (the 

LIBOR Act) was enacted to provide a statutory framework to 
replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in contracts 
that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback 
provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. We 
expect that the LIBOR Act will allow for the transition of certain 
of our commercial credit facilities and other contracts that do 
not have appropriate fallback provisions to replace LIBOR. 

For additional information on the amounts of certain of our 
LIBOR-linked contracts, as well as our transition plans for these 
contracts, see the “Overview – Recent Developments – LIBOR 
Transition” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. For information 
regarding the risks and potential impact of LIBOR or any other 
referenced financial metric being significantly changed, replaced 
or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

Capital Matters 
In June 2022, the Company completed the annual 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test 
process. We expect our stress capital buffer for the period 
October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, to increase 
10 basis points to 3.20%. The FRB has indicated it will publish our 
final stress capital buffer by August 31, 2022. 

On July 26, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the 
Company’s third quarter 2022 common stock dividend to $0.30 
per share. 

For additional information about capital planning, see the 

“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” 
section in this Report.

residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters and Other Customer 
Remediation Activities 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB 
consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. 

Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 

identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable 
and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust 
efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and 
information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with 
our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we 
continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we 
have identified and may in the future identify additional items or 
areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we 
will continue to assess any customer harm and provide 
remediation as appropriate. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters and other customer remediation activities, including 
related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section in 
our 2021 Form 10-K and Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Recent Developments 
LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely 
referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at 
which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. 
On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 
Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator 
of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no 
longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 
2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR 
settings would no longer be published on a representative basis 
after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions 
convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate 
the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the 
Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference 
Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. 
Additionally, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have issued guidance 
strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD 
LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts.

In second quarter 2022, we generated $3.1 billion of net income 
and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $0.74, 
compared with $6.0 billion of net income and diluted EPS of 
$1.38 in the same period a year ago. In the first half of 2022, we 
generated $6.8 billion of net income and diluted EPS of $1.62, 
compared with $10.7 billion of net income and diluted EPS of 
$2.40 in the same period a year ago. Financial performance for 
the second quarter and first half of 2022, compared with the 
same periods a year ago, included the following: 
• 

total revenue decreased due to lower net gains from equity 
securities and mortgage banking income, partially offset by 
higher net interest income; 
provision for credit losses increased reflecting loan growth 
and modest weakening in the economic outlook; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower personnel 
expense, professional and outside services expense, and 
other expense, partially offset by higher operating losses; 
average loans increased due to growth in commercial and 
industrial, commercial real estate mortgage, credit card, 
auto and other consumer loans, partially offset by a decrease 
in residential mortgage – junior lien loans as paydowns 
exceeded originations. The first half of 2022 was also 
impacted by a decrease in residential mortgage – first lien 
loans as paydowns exceeded originations; and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in the 
Consumer Banking and Lending operating segment due to 
higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer 
customers, partially offset by actions taken to manage under 
the asset cap which reduced deposits in the Corporate and 
Investment Banking operating segment and Corporate.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in the first half of 2022, 
with total equity of $179.8 billion at June 30, 2022, compared 
with $190.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Our liquidity and 
regulatory capital ratios remained strong at June 30, 2022, 
including: 
• 

our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 10.38% under 
the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 
9.10%; 
our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of 
total risk-weighted assets was 22.72%, compared with the 
regulatory minimum of 21.50%; and 
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 121%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%.

See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the following: 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$12.9 billion at June 30, 2022, decreased $904 million from 
December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty around 
the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan 
portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by increased 
uncertainty related to the risks of high inflation, as well as 
loan growth. 

• 

• 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(197) million in 
the first half of 2022, compared with $(2.4) billion in the 
same period a year ago, reflecting loan growth and modest 
weakening in the economic outlook, partially offset by lower 
net charge-offs. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.37% at June 30, 
2022, compared with 1.54% at December 31, 2021. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $23 million, 
or 2 basis points of average commercial loans, in second 
quarter 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$80 million, or 7 basis points, in the same period a year ago, 
due to lower losses and higher recoveries in our commercial 
and industrial portfolio within the transportation services 
and financials except banks industries. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $321 million, 
or 33 basis points of average consumer loans, in second 
quarter 2022, compared with net loan charge-offs of 
$301 million, or 32 basis points, in the same period a year 
ago, driven by lower recoveries in our residential mortgage 
portfolio and higher losses in our auto and other consumer 
portfolios, partially offset by lower losses in our credit card 
portfolio. 

• 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $6.1 billion at June 30, 
2022, decreased $1.2 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 
2021, driven by decreases in all commercial nonaccrual loan 
portfolios, and a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual 
loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers 
after exiting COVID-19-related accommodation programs. 
NPAs represented 0.65% of total loans at June 30, 2022.

Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended June 30, 2022 
and 2021. 

For additional information about net interest income and 

net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net 
Interest Income” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for second quarter 2022 was $3.1 billion 
($0.74 diluted EPS), compared with $6.0 billion ($1.38 diluted 
EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in 
second quarter 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, 
due to a $4.6 billion decrease in noninterest income and a 
$1.8 billion increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset 
by a $1.4 billion increase in net interest income, a $871 million 
decrease in net income from noncontrolling interests, a 
$832 million decrease in income tax expense, and a $458 million 
decrease in noninterest expense. 

Net income for the first half of 2022 was $6.8 billion 
($1.62 diluted EPS), compared with $10.7 billion ($2.40 diluted 
EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in the 
first half of 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, due 
to a $6.0 billion decrease in noninterest income and a $2.1 billion 
increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 
$1.8 billion increase in net interest income, a $1.0 billion decrease 
in income tax expense, a $794 million decrease in net income 
from noncontrolling interests, and a $577 million decrease in 
noninterest expense. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income and net interest margin increased in both 
the second quarter and first half of 2022, compared with the 
same periods a year ago, due to the impact of higher interest 
rates on earning assets, higher loan balances, and lower 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, 
partially offset by lower interest income from Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) loans and loans purchased from 
securitization pools, and higher expenses for interest-bearing 
deposits and long-term debt. Interest income from PPP loans 
was $70 million in the first half of 2022, compared with $272 
million in the same period a year ago. Additionally, interest 
income associated with loans we purchased from Government 
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools 
was $378 million in the first half of 2022, compared with $525 
million in the same period a year ago. For additional information 
about loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools, see 
the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage 
Banking Activities” section in this Report.

The average balance amounts represent amortized costs, except for certain held-to-maturity debt securities, which exclude unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of those securities 
from available-for-sale debt securities. The interest rates are based on interest income or expense amounts for the period and are annualized. Interest rates and amounts include the effects of hedge 
and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories. 

(2)  Nonaccrual loans and any related income are included in their respective loan categories. 
(3) 

Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $108 million and $109 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $215 million and $216 million for the first half of 2022 
and 2021, respectively, predominantly related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and securities.

NM – Not meaningful 

Second quarter 2022 vs. second quarter 2021 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting: 
• 

lower asset-based and trust fees due to divestitures in 
fourth quarter 2021; and 
lower average market valuations. 

• 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” section in this Report. 

Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market activity 
and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance 
commitments due to the widening of market spreads. 

Net servicing income increased driven by: 
• 

lower amortization of the fair value mortgage servicing right 
(MSR) due to lower prepayment rates resulting from 
increases in interest rates; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower contractually specified servicing fees due to a lower 
balance of loans serviced for others. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
• 

lower residential mortgage held for sale (HFS) origination 
volumes and lower margins in our retail and correspondent 
production channels; 
lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools; and 
a shift in production to more correspondent loans, which 
have a lower production margin compared with retail loans. 

• 

• 

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting: 
• 

higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue, 
as well as higher trading activity in equities; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed 
securities and high yield products. 

Net gains from debt securities increased due to higher gains on 
sales of asset-backed securities and municipal bonds as a result 
of increased sales volumes. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
• 
lower unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
driven by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; 
lower realized gains on the sales of equity securities; and 
a $576 million impairment of equity securities (before the 
impact of noncontrolling interests) predominantly in our 
affiliated venture capital business driven by market 
conditions. 

• 
• 

Other income decreased driven by a gain on the sale of a portion 
of our student loan portfolio in second quarter 2021. 

First half of 2022 vs. first half of 2021 

Deposit-related fees increased driven by: 
• 

lower fee waivers and reversals as the first half of 2021 
included various accommodations to support customers 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other temporary 
fee waivers; and 
higher overdraft fees driven by increased consumer 
transaction volumes, partially offset by the initial 
implementation of overdraft policy changes in 2022. 

• 

For additional information on servicing income and net gains 

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

In January 2022, we announced enhancements and changes 

to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft-related fees, 
which we began to implement in March 2022. We expect this will 
lower certain deposit-related fees for the remainder of 2022.

Net gains from trading activities increased reflecting: 
•

revenue, as well as higher trading activity in equities; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed 
securities and high yield products. 

Net gains (losses) from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
• 
lower unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
driven by our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; 
lower realized gains on the sales of equity securities; and 
a $1.0 billion impairment of equity securities (before the 
impact of noncontrolling interests) predominantly in our 
affiliated venture capital business driven by market 
conditions. 

• 
• 

Other income decreased due to: 
• 

a gain on the sale of substantially all of our student loan 
portfolio in the first half of 2021; and 
higher losses due to growth in wind energy investments 
(offset by benefits and credits in income tax expense); 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we sold. For additional information, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk -
Equity Securities” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting: 
• 

lower asset-based and trust fees due to divestitures in 
fourth quarter 2021; and 
lower average market valuations. 

• 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” section in this Report. 

Commissions and brokerage services fees decreased driven by 
lower transactional revenue. 

Investment banking fees decreased due to lower market activity 
and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance 
commitments due to the widening of market spreads. 

Card fees increased reflecting higher incentives and higher 
interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased purchase 
and transaction volumes. 

• 

Net servicing income increased driven by: 
• 

lower amortization of the fair value MSR due to lower 
prepayment rates driven by increases in interest rates; and 
lower unreimbursed servicing costs due to lower payoff 
volumes; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower contractually specified servicing fees due to a lower 
balance of loans serviced for others. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
driven by: 
• 

lower residential mortgage HFS origination volumes and 
lower margins in our retail and correspondent production 
channels; 
lower gains related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools; and 
a shift in production to more correspondent loans, which 
have a lower production margin compared with retail loans.

Second quarter 2022 vs. second quarter 2021 

Occupancy expense decreased driven by efficiency initiatives. 

Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

the impact of divestitures and efficiency initiatives; 
lower incentive compensation expense, including the impact 
of lower market valuations on stock-based compensation; 
and 
lower revenue-related compensation expense. 

• 

Operating losses increased driven by higher litigation expense 
and higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a 
variety of historical matters. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Leases expense decreased driven by lower depreciation expense 
from a reduction in the size of our operating lease asset portfolio. 

Advertising and promotion expense decreased driven by lower 
marketing and brand campaign volumes. 

Other expenses decreased driven by: 
• 

a write-down of goodwill in second quarter 2021 related to 
the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio; and 
lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP 
processing fees in second quarter 2021. 

• 

First half of 2022 vs. first half of 2021 

Personnel expense decreased driven by: 
• 
• 

the impact of divestitures and efficiency initiatives; 
lower incentive compensation expense, including the impact 
of lower market valuations on stock-based compensation; 
and 
lower revenue-related compensation expense. 

• 

Operating losses increased driven by higher customer 
remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical 
matters, and higher litigation expense. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Leases expense decreased driven by lower depreciation expense 
from a reduction in the size of our operating lease asset portfolio. 

Other expenses decreased driven by: 
• 

a write-down of goodwill in the first half of 2021 related to 
the sale of substantially all of our student loan portfolio; and 
lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP 
processing fees in the first half of 2021. 

• 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was $613 million in second quarter 2022, 
compared with $1.4 billion in the same period a year ago. The 
effective income tax rate was 16.4% for second quarter 2022, 
compared with 19.3% for the same period a year ago. 

Income tax expense was $1.3 billion in the first half of 2022, 

compared with $2.3 billion in the same period a year ago. The 
effective income tax rate was 16.3% for the first half of 2022, 
compared with 18.0% for the same period a year ago. 

The decrease in our income tax expense for both the second 
quarter and first half of 2022, compared with the same periods a 
year ago, was predominantly driven by lower pre-tax income.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 4. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income 
from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 

Table 4:  Management Reporting Structure 

business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Excludes nonaccrual loans. 
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. 

Second quarter 2022 vs. second quarter 2021 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
origination volumes and margins, and lower gains related to 
the resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA 
securitization pools, partially offset by higher servicing 
income; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and higher deposit balances and deposit spreads; and 
higher deposit-related fees reflecting lower fee waivers and 
reversals, partially offset by lower fees reflecting the initial 
implementation of overdraft policy changes in March 2022. 

• 

Provision for credit losses increased due to loan growth and 
modest weakening in the economic outlook. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower personnel expense driven by lower revenue-related 
compensation in Home Lending due to lower production; 
lower occupancy expense and professional and outside 

• 

• 

services expense related to efficiency initiatives; and 
lower donation expense due to higher donations of PPP 
processing fees in second quarter 2021; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher operating losses reflecting higher customer 
remediation expense predominantly for a variety of 
historical matters, and higher litigation expense. 

First half of 2022 vs. first half of 2021 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
origination volumes and margins, and lower gains related to 
the resecuritization of loans we purchased from GNMA 
securitization pools, partially offset by higher servicing 
income; and 
lower other income driven by lower gains on the sales of 
certain residential mortgage loans which were reclassified to 
held for sale; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and higher deposit balances and deposit spreads;

higher deposit-related fees reflecting lower fee waivers and 
reversals as the first half of 2021 included various 
accommodations to support customers during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other temporary fee waivers, 
and higher overdraft fees in the first half of 2022 driven by 
increased consumer transaction volumes, partially offset by 
the initial implementation of overdraft policy changes in 
2022; and 
higher card fees reflecting higher incentives and higher 
interchange fees, net of rewards, driven by increased 
purchase and transaction volumes. 

Provision for credit losses increased due to loan growth and

Second quarter 2022 vs. second quarter 2021 

Total loans (average) decreased as paydowns exceeded 
originations in our Home Lending and Consumer and Small 
Business Banking businesses, partially offset by higher customer 
spend and the launch of new products in our Credit Card business 
in the second half of 2021 and higher loan balances in our Auto 
business. Consumer and Small Business Banking loan balances 
were impacted by a decline in PPP loans. 

Total deposits (average) increased driven by higher levels of

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net gains from trading activities driven by higher 
foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue, as well 
as higher trading activity in equities, partially offset by lower 
trading activity in residential mortgage-backed securities 
and high yield products; and 
higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads, as well as higher loan balances; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower investment banking fees due to lower market activity 
and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged 
finance commitments due to the widening of market 
spreads; 
lower other noninterest income driven by lower mortgage 
banking income due to lower commercial mortgage-backed 
securities gain on sale margins and volumes. 

• 

Provision for credit losses increased due to loan growth and 
modest weakening in the economic outlook.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First half of 2022 vs. first half of 2021 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads, as well as higher loan balances; and 
higher net gains from trading activities driven by higher 
foreign exchange, rates, and commodities trading revenue, 
as well as higher trading activity in equities, partially offset 
by lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed 
securities and high yield products; 

• 

finance commitments due to the widening of market 
spreads; and 
lower other noninterest income driven by lower mortgage 
banking income due to lower commercial mortgage-backed 
securities gain on sale margins and volumes, partially offset 
by higher income in our low-income housing business; 

Provision for credit losses increased due to loan growth and 
modest weakening in the economic outlook, partially offset by 
lower net charge-offs. 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower investment banking fees due to lower market activity 
and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged 

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher personnel 
expense due to higher salaries expense.

Represents annualized segment total revenue divided by average total financial and wealth advisors for the period. 

Second quarter 2022 vs. second quarter 2021 

Total loans (average) increased due to higher securities-based 
loan balances. 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates, 
as well as higher loan balances; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to lower average market valuations; and 
lower commissions and brokerage services fees due to lower 
transactional revenue.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

First half of 2022 vs. first half of 2021 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates, 
as well as higher deposit and loan balances; and 
higher investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to higher average market valuations; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower commissions and brokerage services fees due to lower 
transactional revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs. 

Total loans (average and period-end) increased due to higher 
securities-based loan balances. 

Total deposits (period-end) decreased as customers continued 
to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are generally based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 5h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes 
that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows 
management, investors, and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

For second quarter 2022 and 2021, the average fee rate by 

account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

Second quarter 2022 vs. second quarter 2021 

First half of 2022 vs. first half of 2021 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net gains from equity securities due to lower 
unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities from 
our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, 
lower realized gains on the sales of equity securities, and 
higher impairment driven by market conditions; 
lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees 
reflecting lower asset-based and trust fees due to 
divestitures in fourth quarter 2021; 
lower net interest income due to higher deposit crediting 
rates paid to the operating segments, unfavorable hedge 
ineffectiveness accounting results, and the sale of our 
Corporate Trust Services business in 2021; and 
a gain on the sale of a portion of our student loan portfolio 
and a modest gain on the sale of our Canadian equipment

• 

lower valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets (as a lessor) of $4.9 billion, 
which was net of $2.2 billion of accumulated depreciation, as of 
June 30, 2022. The average age of our rail cars is 21 years and the 
rail cars are typically leased under short-term leases of 3 to 5 
years. Our three largest concentrations, which represented 55% 
of our rail car fleet as of June 30, 2022, were rail cars used for the 
transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and cement/sand 
products. Impairment may result in the future based on changing 

economic and market conditions affecting the long-term 
demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions 
for impairment are sensitive to estimated utilization and rental 
rates, as well as the estimated economic life of the leased asset. 
For additional information on the accounting for impairment of 
operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2021 
Form 10-K.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $9 million and $8 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $83 million and $96 million related to 
held-to-maturity debt securities at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 6 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments 

in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale 
and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K for information on our investment management 
objectives and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management” section in this Report for information on 
liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 
2021. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities, including HTM 
debt securities through securitizations of loans held for sale 
(LHFS), were more than offset by portfolio runoff and AFS debt 
security sales. In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities 
with a fair value of $43.0 billion to HTM debt securities in the 
first half of 2022 due to actions taken to reposition the overall 
portfolio for capital management purposes. Debt securities 
transferred from AFS to HTM in the first half of 2022 had 
$3.9 billion of pre-tax unrealized losses at the time of the 
transfers. 

The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt 
securities at June 30, 2022, were driven by higher interest rates 
and wider credit spreads. 

At June 30, 2022, 98% of the combined AFS and HTM debt 

securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on 
external ratings where available and, where not available, based 
on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and 
Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information on AFS and HTM debt 
securities, including a summary of debt securities by security 
type.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 7 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased from 
December 31, 2021, predominantly due to an increase in the 
commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan 
demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, 
partially offset by paydowns. Consumer loans increased from 

December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in the 
residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due to loan originations 
of $36.8 billion, partially offset by loan paydowns and the 
transfer of $4.9 billion of first lien mortgage loans to loans held 
for sale (LHFS), substantially all of which related to the sales of 
loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior 
periods.

Deposits 
Deposits decreased from December 31, 2021, reflecting: 
• 

lower interest-bearing demand deposits driven by elevated 
consumer spending, as well as the transition of client assets 
related to the sale of trust deposits; 
customers continuing to allocate more cash into higher 
yielding liquid alternatives; and 
continued actions taken to manage under the asset cap 
resulting in declines in time deposits, such as brokered 
certificates of deposit (CDs);

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. 
These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs 
of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, 
and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring 
activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to 
individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity 
structure of these commitments. For additional information, see 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 11 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 11 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. We continue to monitor our business, 
including our loan portfolios, for any direct, indirect, and macro-
economic impacts stemming from the conflict in Ukraine and any 
associated economic sanctions. 

Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into its credit risk management activities. 

For additional information about how we manage risk, see 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in second quarter 2022 
reflected: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $6.0 billion at June 30, 2022, 

compared with $7.2 billion at December 31, 2021. 
Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased to $1.7 billion at 
June 30, 2022, compared with $2.4 billion at December 31, 
2021, and consumer nonaccrual loans decreased to 
$4.3 billion at June 30, 2022, compared with $4.8 billion at 
December 31, 2021. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.64% of 
total loans at June 30, 2022, compared with 0.81% at 
December 31, 2021. 

•  Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of our 
average commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 
0.02% and 0.33% in the second quarter and 0.00% and 0.34% 
in the first half of 2022, respectively, compared with 0.07% 
and 0.32% in the second quarter and 0.10% and 0.35%, 
respectively, in the first half of 2021. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were 
$579 million and $412 million in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, at June 30, 2022, 
compared with $235 million and $424 million at 
December 31, 2021. 

• 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $578 million and 
$(197) million in the second quarter and first half of 2022, 
respectively, compared with $(1.2) billion and $(2.4) billion 
for the same periods a year ago. 
The ACL for loans decreased to $12.9 billion, or 1.37% of 
total loans, at June 30, 2022, compared with $13.8 billion, or 
1.54%, at December 31, 2021. 

• 

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

the “Risk Management” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. The 
discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the 
management of certain risks contained in the “Risk 
Management” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of the Company’s assets and exposures such as loans, debt 
securities, and certain derivatives. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part of 
Independent Risk Management, has oversight responsibility for 
credit risk. Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk Officer and 
supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided to the 
Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio  Our loan portfolios represent the largest 
component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which 
we have credit risk. Table 9 presents our total loans outstanding 
by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions;

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

Table 10:  Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing by Industry 

We had $11.1 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at June 30, 2022, compared 
with $13.0 billion at December 31, 2021. The decline was driven 
by decreases in the technology, telecom and media, real estate 
and construction, and oil, gas and pipelines industries, as these 
industries continued to recover from the economic impacts of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the 
equipment, machinery and parts manufacturing industry. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio increased at June 30, 2022, compared with 

December 31, 2021, driven by higher loan demand resulting in 
increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by 
paydowns. Table 10 provides our commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based 
on the North American Industry Classification System.

Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit. In second quarter 2022, we reclassified commitments for securities-based 
loans from commercial and industrial loan commitments to other consumer loan commitments to align all securities-based loan commitments originated by the Wealth and Investment 
Management operating segment. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. For additional information on issued letters of credit, see

Table 10a provides further loan segmentation for our largest 
industry category, financials except banks. This category includes 
loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, 
rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment 
banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to 

help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, 
collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of 
collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a 
percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering 
underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. We had $10.6 billion of CRE mortgage 
loans classified as criticized at June 30, 2022, compared with 
$13.1 billion at December 31, 2021, and $1.7 billion of CRE 
construction loans classified as criticized at both June 30, 2022 
and December 31, 2021. The decrease in criticized CRE 
mortgage loans was driven by the apartments, hotel/motel, and 
shopping center property types, as these property types 
continued to recover from the economic impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in the office 
buildings property type. The credit quality of certain property 
types within our CRE loan portfolio, such as office buildings, 
could continue to be adversely affected due to uncertainty in 

their recovery from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

The total CRE loan portfolio increased $7.3 billion from 
December 31, 2021, predominantly driven by an increase in 
mixed use properties and apartments property types. The CRE 
loan portfolio included $8.1 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at 
June 30, 2022. The portfolio is diversified both geographically 
and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of 
CRE loans are in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which 
represented a combined 49% of the total CRE portfolio. The 
largest property type concentrations are apartments at 24% and 
office buildings at 23% of the portfolio.

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At June 30, 2022, non-U.S. loans totaled $91.6 billion, 
representing approximately 10% of our total consolidated loans 
outstanding, compared with $86.9 billion, or approximately 10% 
of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 
2021. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 5% and 4% of our total 
consolidated assets at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, 
respectively. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 

legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, 
which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address.

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

June 30, 2022, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$39.4 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $8.7 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch. 

Table 12 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 12: 

Table 12:  Select Country Exposures 

• 

• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised 58.5 billion exposure to financial institutions and $46.9 billion to non-financial corporations at June 30, 2022. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 95% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at June 30, 2022, 
compared with 94% at December 31, 2021. 

The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of 
credit was $20.1 billion at June 30, 2022. The unfunded credit 
commitments for these lines of credit totaled $40.0 billion at 
June 30, 2022. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both June 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021. We believe our origination process 
appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
reset risk across our residential mortgage loans and our ACL for 
loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM products, 
nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed 
payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial 
services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. 
These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only 
payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar 

features. For additional information on our residential mortgage 
loan portfolio, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. For additional information 
about appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for their use, see Note 4 
(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 
2021 Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and 
junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit 
line products) to property collateral value. For additional 
information regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 4 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For additional information on loan modifications, see 
the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential 
Mortgage Loans” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. Customer 
payment deferral activities instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
delinquencies. For information on customer accommodations, 
including loan modifications, in response to the COVID-19

Table 13:  Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio Performance 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio increased $10.7 billion from 
December 31, 2021, driven by originations of $36.8 billion, 
partially offset by loan paydowns and the transfer of $4.9 billion

Credit Card  Our credit card portfolio totaled $41.2 billion at 
June 30, 2022, compared with $38.5 billion at December 31, 
2021. The increase in the outstanding balance at June 30, 2022, 
compared with December 31, 2021, was due to higher purchase 
volume and the launch of new products. 

Auto  Our auto portfolio totaled $55.7 billion at June 30, 2022, 
compared with $56.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The 
outstanding balance at June 30, 2022, compared with 
December 31, 2021, decreased due to lower origination volumes. 

Other Consumer  Other consumer loans totaled $29.4 billion at 
June 30, 2022, compared with $28.3 billion at December 31, 
2021. The increase in the outstanding balance at June 30, 2022, 
compared with December 31, 2021, was primarily due to 
originations of personal lines and loans. 

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  For information about when we generally place loans on 
nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2021 
Form 10-K. Customer payment deferral activities in the 
residential mortgage portfolio instituted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of 
nonaccrual loans for those residential mortgage customers who 
would have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For 
information on customer accommodations, including loan 
modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related 
Lending Accommodations” section in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $657 million from 

December 31, 2021, predominantly due to a decline in 
commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans and real estate 
mortgage nonaccrual loans. For additional information on 
commercial nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 

Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $562 million from 
December 31, 2021, driven by a decrease in residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment performance of 
borrowers after exiting COVID-19-related accommodation 
programs.

Table 17 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in 
developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to 
losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors 
at June 30, 2022: 
• 

93% of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured, the 
majority of which are secured by real estate. 
80% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 78% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain. 
99% of total consumer nonaccrual loans are secured, of 
which 95% are secured by real estate and 98% have a 
combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
$637 million of the $811 million of consumer loans in 
bankruptcy or discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as 
nonaccrual, were current.

Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. 
Includes loans moved into foreclosed assets from nonaccrual status and repossessed autos. 

As part of our actions to support customers during the 

COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended certain 
residential mortgage foreclosure activities through 
December 31, 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, we resumed 
these mortgage foreclosure activities. For additional information 
on loans in process of foreclosure, see Note 4 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 19 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2021, 
predominantly driven by a decrease in residential mortgage – 
first lien loans, partially offset by an increase in trial 
modifications. The decrease in residential mortgage – first lien 
loans was due to paydowns and transfers to LHFS, which related 
to sales of repurchased loans from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. 

The amount of our TDRs at June 30, 2022, would have 
otherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) 

and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and 
Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers 
Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (Interagency Statement). 
Customers who are unable to resume making their contractual 
loan payments upon exiting from these deferral programs may 
require further assistance and may receive or be eligible to 
receive modifications, which may be classified as TDRs. For 
additional information on the CARES Act and the Interagency 
Statement, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in our 2021 Form 10-K.

additional information regarding TDRs. 

Table 20 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for 
loans, see Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional 
information on our ACL for debt securities, see Note 3 (Available-
for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Table 22 presents the allocation of the ACL for loans by loan 

portfolio segment and class. 

quarter 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
due to lower losses and higher recoveries in our commercial and 
industrial portfolio within the transportation services and 
financials except banks industries. 

The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in second 
quarter 2022, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
driven by lower recoveries in our residential mortgage portfolio 
and higher losses in our auto and other consumer portfolios, 
partially offset by lower losses in our credit card portfolio. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities in our residential mortgage portfolio instituted 
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay 
the recognition of residential mortgage loan charge-offs. For 
information on customer accommodations in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other 
off-balance sheet credit exposures.

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 22 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral.

 The ACL for loans decreased $904 million, or 7%, from 
December 31, 2021, reflecting reduced uncertainty around the 
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our loan 
portfolio. This decrease was partially offset by increased 
uncertainty related to the risks of high inflation, as well as loan 
growth. The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by 
portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan 
class) is included in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base 
scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. In our estimate of the ACL for 
loans at June 30, 2022, we weighted the base scenario and the 
downside scenarios to reflect our economic outlook. The base 
scenario assumed moderate economic growth with elevated 
inflation in the near term. The downside scenarios assumed 
economic contractions due to high inflation and rising interest 
rates. 

Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent 

risks inherent in our processes and assumptions such as 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at June 30 and March 31, 2022, are 
presented in Table 23.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
real GDP), among other factors. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $12.9 billion at June 30, 
2022, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including 
unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance 
is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. 
The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing 
factors as of the date of determination, including economic or 
market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination

processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes 
in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we 
will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the 
balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is 
discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for 
Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and 
commercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with 
our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we 
have established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information 
on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 
2021 Form 10-K. 

In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as 
servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial 
mortgage loans included in government sponsored entity (GSE)-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed 
mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as 
for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors.

 As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent 
payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. 
The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of 
delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable 
servicing agreements. See Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) 
to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information 
about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer 
advances and servicing fees. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, 

delinquency status continues to advance for loans with COVID-
related payment deferrals, which has resulted in an increase in 
delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase 
in loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to 
repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which 
generally becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan 
payments remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally 
repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total 
consolidated assets do not change. These repurchased loan 
balances were $10.9 billion and $17.3 billion at June 30, 2022 and 
December 31, 2021, respectively, which included $8.4 billion and 
$12.9 billion, respectively, in our held for investment loan 
portfolio, with the remainder in loans held for sale. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information about our involvement with mortgage 
loan securitizations. 

For additional information about the risks related to our 
servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. For additional information on mortgage banking 
activities, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For 
information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 
Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a 
slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans 
and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as 
all tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar 
interest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the 
simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24: 
• 
Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across 
the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher-
yielding products could impact expected net interest 
income.

• 

The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the 
historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the 
expectations of deposit products repricing as market 
interest rates change (referred to as deposit betas) as well as 
shifts in the mix of our deposit products. Our actual 
experience may differ from expectations due to the lag or 
acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer 
behavior, and other factors. 

•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from 
December 31, 2021 to June 30, 2022 in Table 24 reflected 
updates to our base scenario, which included changes in 
expectations for both balance sheet composition and interest 
rates. Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect 
to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice 
faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the 
case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward 
and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net 
interest income. For the December 31, 2021 simulations with 
downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00% interest rate floor 
limited the amount of the decline in net interest income. We may 
have a larger decline in net interest income when interest rates 
increase for the base scenario relative to the interest rate floor. 
The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are primarily driven by 
mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management 
– Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2021 Form 10-K for additional 
information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted 
by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits 
that reduce treasury management deposit service fees, and 
trading assets, which are generally less sensitive to changes in 
interest rates than the related funding liabilities. In addition, the 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities, which are recorded in noninterest 
income. For additional information on our trading assets and 
liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in 
the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect 
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers 
the amount of our risk-based capital. AOCI also includes 
unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt 
securities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized 
into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact 

from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We 
use derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
• 
to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from floating-rate payments to 
fixed-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 

• 

In the first half of 2022, we entered into interest rate swap 

hedges to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities 
portfolio. Additionally, we entered into interest rate swaps to 
convert the interest cash flows of some floating-rate assets, such 
as commercial loans, to a fixed-rate. Derivatives used to hedge 
our interest rate risk exposures are presented in Note 14 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. For 
additional information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment of private equity investments. For information on 
our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Market Risk” section in our 2021 
Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. For additional information on our 
monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes

for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared with the same 
period a year ago, was driven by reduced market volatility in the 
lookback window used to calculate average Company Trading 
General VaR for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Market 
volatility present in average Company Trading General VaR for 
the quarter ended June 30, 2021, was driven by the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, primarily resulting in changes in interest 
rate curves and a significant widening of credit spreads.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. For additional 
information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 
2021 Form 10-K. 

We also have marketable equity securities that include 

investments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair 
value changes in these marketable equity securities are 
recognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 6 
(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 

cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To help achieve this objective, we monitor both 
the consolidated company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis 
to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, 
deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. The Parent acts as a source 
of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term 
debt and equity, and WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), provides 
funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the 
Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For 
additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, 
see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section 
in our 2021 Form 10-K. For additional information on the IHC, 
see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and 
Related Matters” section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold 
high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists 
of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and 
mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies 
to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured 
depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or

more. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced 
liquidity risk management standards on large bank holding 
companies (BHCs), such as Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies 
to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total 

assets of $10 billion or more. As of June 30, 2022, we were 
compliant with the NSFR requirement. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of June 30, 2022, the consolidated 
Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank 
West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100%. 
Table 26 presents the Company’s quarterly average values for 
the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant 
to the LCR rule requirements. The LCR represents average HQLA 
divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is 
defined under the LCR rule.

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the 
exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 27 at fair value, which also includes encumbered securities 
that are not included as available HQLA in the calculation of the 
LCR.

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 27, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. As of June 30, 2022, we also maintained 
approximately $216.4 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 151% and 166% of total 
loans at June 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings. Table 28 presents a summary of our short-term 
borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. We 
pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of 
Note 12 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

We access domestic and international capital markets for 

long-term funding (generally greater than one year) through 
issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and 
asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-term debt in a

funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. 
Proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate 
purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

On May 23, 2022, DBRS Morningstar confirmed the 
Company’s ratings and changed the rating trend to stable from 
negative. On June 6, 2022, Fitch Ratings affirmed the Company’s

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. FHLB members are 
required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, the amount of any future investment in the capital 
stock of the FHLBs is not determinable. 

Wells Fargo & Company

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at June 30, 
2022, increased $4.2 billion from December 31, 2021, 
predominantly as a result of $6.8 billion of Wells Fargo net 
income, partially offset by $2.5 billion of common and preferred 
stock dividends. During the first half of 2022, we issued 
$716 million of common stock, substantially all of which was 
issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. 
In the first half of 2022, we repurchased 110 million shares of 
common stock at a cost of $6 billion. In the first half of 2022, our 
AOCI decreased $8.9 billion, predominantly due to net unrealized 
losses on AFS debt securities. As interest rates increase, changes 
in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect 
AOCI, which lowers the amount of our risk-based capital. For 
additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital 
Planning and Stress Testing” section below. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, 
and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both 
approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 31 and 
Table 32 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable 
to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced 
Approach, respectively, as of June 30, 2022.

Capital conservation buffer 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 31 and Table 32, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at June 30, 2022, 
was 0.00%. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress. 

48 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
 
 
 
  
  
The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, is 
3.10%. We expect our stress capital buffer for the period 
October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, to be 3.20%. The 
FRB has indicated that it will publish the final stress capital buffer 
for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, for 
each BHC by August 31, 2022. 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also 

subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital 
surcharge of between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually 
calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of 
the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our 
size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 

Table 33:  Capital Components and Ratios 

inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 
wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If 
our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our 
annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. For 
2022, our G-SIB capital surcharge is 1.50%. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Table 33 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total 
capital, RWAs and capital ratios at June 30, 2022, and 
December 31, 2021.

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of the current expected credit loss accounting 
standard (CECL) on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two 
and 75% in year three. 
Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of 
qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 
1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs.

Standardized and Advanced Approaches at June 30, 2022, and

RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in 
consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred 
taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, 
which represents tangible common equity divided by common 
shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of 
determining tangible common equity may differ among 
companies. Management believes that tangible book value per 
common share and return on average tangible common equity, 
which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial 
measures because they enable management, investors, and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 38 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 39 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of June 30, 
2022. 

Table 39:  Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 
rules. For information regarding the proposed amendments to 
the SLR rules, see the “Capital Management – Leverage 
Requirements” section in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
June 30, 2022, are presented in Table 41.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 
100 basis points above the regulatory minimum and buffers, plus 
an incremental internal buffer of up to 25 basis points. Our 
capital targets are subject to change based on various factors, 
including changes to the regulatory requirements for our capital 
ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and 
other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 

other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

As part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB 
reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the 
Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all 
large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital 
actions. The FRB published its supervisory stress test results on 
June 23, 2022. 

On July 26, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the 
Company’s third quarter 2022 common stock dividend to $0.30 
per share. 

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the 
institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.

price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At June 30, 2022, we had remaining Board authority to

Capital Management (continued) 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. 

For a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the 

Company, see the “Overview” section in this Report. For a 
discussion of other significant regulations and regulatory 
oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our 
business, see the “Regulatory Matters” and “Risk Factors” 
sections in our 2021 Form 10-K and the “Regulatory Matters” 
section in our 2022 First Quarter Report on Form 10-Q.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2021 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results 
of operations and financial condition because they require that 
we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of 
our assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies 
are critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. For additional information on these policies, see the 
“Critical Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2021 Form 10-K and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 43 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective.

Description and Effective Date 

Financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 
The Update, effective January 1, 2023, 
requires market risk benefits (features 
of insurance contracts that protect the 
policyholder from other-than-nominal 
capital market risk and expose the 
insurer to that risk) to be measured at 
fair value through earnings with 
changes in fair value attributable to our 
own credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. The Update 
also requires more frequent updates for 
insurance assumptions, mandates the 
use of a standardized discount rate for 
traditional long-duration contracts, and 
simplifies the amortization of deferred 
acquisition costs. 

The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited 
number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. These 
variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit 
payments for the remainder of the policyholder's life once the account values are exhausted. These 
guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair 
value. The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon adoption of 
the Update, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk, will be 
recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the earliest period presented and will affect our 
regulatory capital calculations. At June 30, 2022, our estimated liability related to these guaranteed 
minimum benefits was approximately $500 million and was associated with approximately $10.5 billion of 
policyholder account values. We expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market 
risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder 
behavior and changes in mortality assumptions. We plan to economically hedge the market volatility, 
where feasible. Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-
duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material. 

ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method 

The Update, effective January 1, 2023 
(with early adoption permitted), 
establishes the portfolio layer method, 
which expands an entity’s ability to 
achieve fair value hedge accounting for 
interest rate risk hedges of closed 
portfolios of financial assets. The 
Update also provides guidance on the 
accounting for hedged item basis 
adjustments under the portfolio layer 
method. 

The Update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with 
portfolios of financial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale debt securities and loans. The Update 
allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of 
derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to 
include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets. 

Upon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively. 
Additionally, the Update permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-to-maturity to 
available-for-sale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge 
no later than 30 days after the adoption date. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on 
our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

The Update, effective January 1, 2023 
(with early adoption permitted), 
eliminates the accounting guidance for 
troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by 
creditors and introduces new required 
disclosures for loan modifications made 
to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty. The Update also amends the 
guidance for vintage disclosures to 
require disclosure of current period 
gross charge-offs by year of origination. 

The Update will impact the measurement of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and require new 
disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality, specifically the Update: 
• 

Eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach to measure the ACL for 
certain TDRs and instead allows for the use of an expected loss approach for all loans. Upon adoption, 
we expect to discontinue using a DCF approach for consumer loans and retain a DCF approach for 
certain nonperforming commercial loans. Any changes to the ACL as a result of the change in TDR 
measurement will be included as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of 
the earliest period presented. 
Requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the 
form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other than insignificant payment delay, term 
extension, or a combination of these modifications. 
Requires us to provide current period gross charge-offs by origination date (vintage) in our credit 
quality disclosures on a prospective basis beginning as of the adoption date.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters (including the conflict in 
Ukraine), and any slowdown in global economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2021.

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results. 

Forward-Looking Statements (continued) 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law.
