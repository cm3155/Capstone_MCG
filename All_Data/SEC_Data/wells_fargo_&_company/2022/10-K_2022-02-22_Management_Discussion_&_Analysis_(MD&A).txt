Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets, proudly serves one 
in three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses 
in the U.S., and is the leading middle market banking provider in 
the U.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and 
mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and 
commercial finance, through our four reportable operating 
segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, 
Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment 
Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 37 on Fortune’s 2021 
rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in 
assets and third in the market value of our common stock among 
all U.S. banks at December 31, 2021. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control 

infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The 
Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among 
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, 
operations, products and services, and risk management 
practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to 
take multiple years, and we are likely to experience issues or 
delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. Issues or 
delays with one regulatory action could affect our progress on 
others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory 
action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties, 
enforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which 
could be significant. While we still have significant work to do, the 
Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to 
operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the 
highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in 
place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 
Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 

and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 
April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the 
Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet 
exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in 
connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck 
Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program. 
As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the 
extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from 
the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received 
by the Company from loans made in connection with these 
programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to nonprofit 
organizations approved by the FRB that support small 
businesses. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not 
excluded these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of 
the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be 
conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the 
enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest 
rate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the 
Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide 
compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the 
Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal 
consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In 
addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers 
affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and 
mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the 
management of remediation activities conducted by the 
Company. The Company continues to work to address the 
provisions of the consent orders. The Company has not yet 
satisfied certain aspects of the consent orders, and as a result, we 
believe regulators may impose additional penalties or take other 

2 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
 
enforcement actions. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a 
$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to 
insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s 
April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the 
Company’s Home Lending business. 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the 
execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party 
residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters and Other Customer 
Remediation Activities 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB 
consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. 

Our priority of rebuilding trust has also included an effort to 

identify other areas or instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, 
and implement additional operational and control procedures. 
We are working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. We 
have previously disclosed key areas of focus as part of our 
rebuilding trust efforts and are in the process of providing 
remediation for those matters. We have accrued for the probable 
and estimable remediation costs related to our rebuilding trust 
efforts, which amounts may change based on additional facts and 
information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with 
our regulators. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we 
continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we 
have identified and may in the future identify additional items or 
areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we 
will continue to assess any customer harm and provide 
remediation as appropriate. 

For additional information regarding retail sales practices 
matters and other customer remediation activities, including 
related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” section 
and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Recent Developments 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been working 
diligently to protect employee safety while continuing to carry 
out Wells Fargo’s role as a provider of essential services to the 
public. We have taken comprehensive steps to help customers, 
employees and communities. 

We have strong levels of capital and liquidity, and we remain 
focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get 
through these unprecedented times. 

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) created funding for the 
Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan program providing 
forgiveness of up to the full principal amount of qualifying loans 
guaranteed under a program called the Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP). We funded approximately $14.0 billion in loans 
under the PPP. At December 31, 2021, we had $2.4 billion of PPP 
loans outstanding. We voluntarily committed to donate all of the 
gross processing fees received from PPP loans funded in 2020. In 
2021, we fulfilled this approximately $420 million commitment. 

LIBOR Transition 
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely 
referenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at 
which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. 
On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 
Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator 
of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no 
longer be published on a representative basis after December 31, 
2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR 
settings would no longer be published on a representative basis 
after June 30, 2023. Central banks in various jurisdictions 
convened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate 
the transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the 
Federal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference 
Rates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR. 
Additionally, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have issued guidance 
strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD 
LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts. 

In preparation for the cessation of the various LIBOR 

settings, we have undertaken a variety of activities. Among other 
things, we proactively implemented internal “stop-sell” dates to 
discontinue offering products referencing LIBOR except 
pursuant to limited exceptions consistent with regulatory 
guidance. At the same time, we expanded our suite of product 
offerings that are indexed to alternative reference rates. 

We also continue to transition our legacy LIBOR contracts to 

• 

alternative reference rates. We transitioned substantially all of 
our legacy contracts with LIBOR settings impacted by the 
December 31, 2021, cessation date to alternative reference 
rates, and we will continue to address contracts with LIBOR 
settings that are impacted by the June 30, 2023, cessation date. 
For USD LIBOR contracts that mature before June 30, 2023, 
• 
those contracts that are renewed or replaced will be indexed 
to alternative reference rates. 
At December 31, 2021, the notional amount of our 
derivatives indexed to USD LIBOR, including bilateral 
contracts that mature after June 30, 2023, and centrally-
cleared contracts that mature either before or after June 30, 
2023, was over $6 trillion. We expect substantially all of 
these contracts to transition to SOFR either prior to or 
immediately after June 30, 2023, in accordance with existing 
fallback provisions. 
At December 31, 2021, we had over $350 billion of USD 
LIBOR commercial credit facilities that mature after June 30, 
2023. These contracts generally do not contain appropriate 
fallback provisions. We are proactively engaging with our 
clients and contract parties to amend these contracts to 
replace LIBOR with an alternative reference rate or to 
include appropriate fallback provisions, if necessary. 
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $30 billion of 
USD LIBOR consumer loans and lines secured by residential 
real estate that mature after June 30, 2023. We expect 

• 

• 

Wells Fargo & Company 

3 

Overview (continued) 

• 

these contracts to transition to alternative reference rates in 
accordance with existing fallback provisions. 
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $45 billion of 
debt securities indexed to USD LIBOR that mature after 
June 30, 2023. Substantially all of these debt securities 
contain fallback provisions and are expected to transition to 
an alternative reference rate immediately after June 30, 
2023. 

• 

• 

Additionally, we continue to monitor legislative 

developments that would provide a statutory framework to 
replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR in contracts 
that do not have fallback provisions or that have fallback 
provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on LIBOR. 

For information regarding the risks and potential impact of 

LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being significantly 
changed, replaced, or discontinued, see the “Risk Factors” section 
in this Report. 

Capital Matters 
Effective October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, the 
Company’s stress capital buffer used to determine our minimum 
risk-based capital requirements under the Standardized 
Approach became 3.10%. Beginning January 1, 2022, our global 
systemically important bank (G-SIB) capital surcharge decreased 
by 50 basis points from 2.00% to 1.50%. 

Effective January 1, 2022, we are required to use the 
Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) 
for calculating exposure amounts for credit risk-weighted assets 
(RWAs) on derivative contracts. The adoption of SA-CCR 
resulted in an increase of less than 1.00% in total RWAs under the 
Standardized Approach (which was our binding approach at 
December 31, 2021) and a decrease of less than 0.50% in total 
leverage exposure at January 1, 2022. 

On January 25, 2022, the Board approved an increase to the 

Company’s first quarter 2022 common stock dividend to 
$0.25 per share. For additional information about capital 
planning, see the “Capital Management – Capital Planning and 
Stress Testing” section in this Report. 

Business Divestitures 
On November 1, 2021, we closed our previously announced 
agreement to sell our Corporate Trust Services business and our 
previously announced agreement to sell Wells Fargo Asset 
Management (WFAM). We recorded net gains of $674 million 
and $269 million, respectively, from these sales, which are 
subject to certain post-closing adjustments and earn-out 
provisions. 

Financial Performance 
In 2021, we generated $21.5 billion of net income and diluted 
earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.95, compared with 
$3.4 billion of net income and EPS of $0.43 in 2020. Financial 
performance for 2021, compared with 2020, included the 
following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net gains from equity 
securities, mortgage banking income, and investment 
advisory and other asset-based fee income, partially offset 
by lower net interest income; 
provision for credit losses decreased reflecting continued 
improvements in the economic environment, which led to 
lower charge-offs and better portfolio credit quality; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses, restructuring charges, and professional and outside 

• 

• 

4 

services expense, partially offset by higher incentive and 
revenue-related compensation in personnel expense; 
average loans decreased due to paydowns exceeding 
originations in our residential mortgage loan portfolio, weak 
demand for commercial loans, and the reclassification of 
student loans (included in other consumer loans) to loans 
held for sale (LHFS); and 
average deposits increased driven by growth in the 
Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, and 
Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating 
segments due to higher levels of liquidity and savings for 
consumer and commercial customers reflecting government 
stimulus programs and continued economic uncertainty 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the 
impact of payment deferral programs on consumer 
customers, partially offset by actions taken to manage under 
the asset cap which reduced deposits in the Corporate and 
Investment Banking operating segment and Corporate. 

In second quarter 2021, we retroactively changed the 
accounting for certain tax-advantaged investments. These 
changes had a nominal impact on net income and retained 
earnings on an annual basis and did not impact historical trends 
or business drivers. Prior period financial statement line items 
have been revised to conform with the current period 
presentation. Prior period risk-based capital and certain other 
regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional 
information, including the financial statement line items 
impacted by these changes, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in 2021, with total 
equity of $190.1 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with 
$185.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Our liquidity and regulatory 
capital ratios remained strong at December 31, 2021, including: 
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.35% under 
• 
the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which 
continued to exceed both the regulatory requirement of 
9.60% and our current internal target; 
our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a 
percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.03%, 
compared with the regulatory requirement of 21.50%; and 
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 118%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%. 

• 

• 

See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts. 

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the improving economic environment. 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$13.8 billion at December 31, 2021, decreased $5.9 billion 
from December 31, 2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(4.2) billion in 
2021, down from $14.0 billion in 2020. The decrease in the 
ACL for loans and the provision for credit losses in 2021, 
compared with 2020, reflected continued improvements in 
the economic environment, which led to lower charge-offs 
and better portfolio credit quality.

• 

• 

The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.54% at 
December 31, 2021, compared with 2.22% at December 31, 
2020. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were 
$295 million, or 6 basis points of average commercial loans, 
in 2021, compared with net loan charge-offs of $1.6 billion, 
or 31 basis points, in 2020, due to lower losses and higher 
recoveries in our commercial and industrial portfolio 
primarily driven by the oil, gas and pipelines industry, and in 
the real estate mortgage portfolio. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $1.3 billion, or 
33 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2021, 
compared with net loan charge-offs of $1.7 billion, or 
39 basis points, in 2020, predominantly driven by lower 
losses in our credit card portfolio as a result of government 
stimulus programs instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, improvements in the economic environment and 

better portfolio credit quality, partially offset by 
$152 million of residential mortgage loan charge-offs as a 
result of a change in practice to fully charge-off certain 
delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. 

•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $7.3 billion at 

December 31, 2021, decreased $1.6 billion, or 18%, from 
December 31, 2020, predominantly driven by decreases in 
our commercial and industrial portfolio as a result of 
paydowns in the oil, gas, and pipelines industry, partially 
offset by increases in our residential mortgage – first lien 
portfolio from certain borrowers exiting COVID-19 related 
accommodation programs. NPAs represented 0.82% of total 
loans at December 31, 2021.

Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity. 
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may 
differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables management, 
investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial 
measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
See the “Capital Management” section and Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
The information presented reflects fully phased-in CET1, tier 1 capital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital in accordance with transition requirements. For additional information, see the “Capital 
Management” section and Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Represents TLAC divided by the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, which is our binding TLAC ratio. 
Represents high-quality liquid assets divided by projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. 
Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared per common share as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share.

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for 2021 was $21.5 billion ($4.95 diluted 
EPS), compared with $3.4 billion ($0.43 diluted EPS) for 2020. 
Net income increased in 2021, compared with 2020, due to a 
$18.3 billion decrease in provision for credit losses, a $8.4 billion 
increase in noninterest income, and a $3.8 billion decrease in 
noninterest expense, partially offset by a $6.7 billion increase in 
income tax expense, a $4.2 billion decrease in net interest 
income, and a $1.4 billion increase in net income from 
noncontrolling interests. 

For a discussion of our 2020 financial results, compared with 

2019, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. 

Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio 
and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources 
of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and 
collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from 
period to period. 

Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in 

2021, compared with 2020, due to the impact of lower interest 
rates, lower loan balances reflecting soft demand, elevated 
prepayments and refinancing activity, the sale of our student 
loan portfolio in the first half of 2021, unfavorable hedge 
ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher securities 
premium amortization, partially offset by lower costs and 
balances of interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt. Net 
interest income in 2021 included interest income from PPP loans 
of $518 million. Additionally, in 2021, we had interest income 
associated with loans we purchased from Government National 
Mortgage Association (GNMA) loan securitization pools of 
$1.1 billion. For additional information about loans purchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools, see the “Risk Management 
– Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” 
section in this Report. 

Table 3 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and the net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 3 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 
2021, 2020 and 2019.

Table 4 allocates the changes in net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or 
average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume 
and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely 

allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, 
changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are 
allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based on the 
absolute value of the change due to average volume and average 
rate.

Deposit-related fees increased driven by: 
• 

higher consumer transaction volumes as 2020 included 
reduced volumes due to the economic slowdown associated 
with the COVID-19 pandemic; 
lower fee waivers and reversals as 2020 included elevated 
fee waivers due to our actions to support customers during 
the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
driven by an increase in transaction service volumes and 
repricing, as well as a lower earnings credit rate due to the 
lower interest rate environment. 

• 

• 

In January 2022, we announced enhancements and changes 

to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft-related fees. 
We expect this will lower certain deposit-related fees starting in 
2022. 

Lending-related fees increased reflecting higher loan 
commitment fees. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees increased 
reflecting: 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher market valuations on WIM advisory assets; 

lower asset-based fees due to the sale of WFAM on 
November 1, 2021. 

For additional information on certain client investment 
assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory 
Assets” and “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment 
Results – Corporate – Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) 
Assets Under Management” sections in this Report. 

Commission and brokerage services fees decreased driven by 
lower transactional revenue.

Investment banking fees increased driven by higher debt 
underwriting fees, including loan syndication fees, as well as 
higher advisory fees and equity underwriting fees. 

Card fees increased reflecting: 
• 

higher interchange fees driven by increased purchase and 
transaction volumes; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher rewards, including promotional offers on our new 
Active CashSM card. 

Net servicing income increased reflecting: 
• 

negative mortgage servicing right (MSR) valuation 
adjustments in 2020 for higher expected servicing costs and 
higher prepayment estimates due to improved economic 
conditions in 2021; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of loans serviced 
for others. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales increased 
driven by: 
• 

higher gains in 2021 related to the resecuritization of loans 
we purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020; 
losses in 2020 driven by the impact of interest rate volatility 
on hedging activities associated with our residential 
mortgage loans held for sale portfolio and pipeline, as well as 
valuation losses on certain residential and commercial loans 
held for sale due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on market conditions; and 
a shift in production to more retail loans, which have a higher 
production margin compared with correspondent loans. 

•

on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Net gains from trading activities decreased reflecting: 
• 
• 

lower volumes of interest rate products; 
lower client trading activity for equity products due to 
market volatility in 2020; and 
lower client trading activity for credit products, reflecting 
greater market liquidity in 2020 from government actions 
taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher client trading activity for asset-backed finance 
products. 

Net gains on debt securities decreased due to: 
•

 lower gains on sales of agency mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) and municipal bonds; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher gains on sales of corporate and other debt securities. 

Net gains from equity securities increased driven by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
from our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses; 
higher realized gains on the sales of equity securities; and 
lower impairment of equity securities due to improved 
market conditions in 2021. 

• 
• 

Lease income decreased driven by a $268 million impairment of 
certain rail cars in our rail car leasing business used for the 
transportation of coal products. 

Other income increased due to gains in 2021 of: 
• 

$674 million on the sale of our Corporate Trust Services 
business; 
$355 million on the sale of our student loan portfolio; and 
$269 million on the sale of WFAM; 

• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower gains on the sales of certain residential mortgage 
loans which were reclassified to held for sale; 
higher valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk, 
including the timing and amount of final settlement, 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we previously sold. For additional information, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk –

higher revenue-related compensation expense; 
higher incentive compensation expense; 
higher market valuations on stock-based compensation; and 
higher deferred compensation expense; 

Personnel expense increased driven by: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower salaries as a result of reduced headcount. 

In second quarter 2020, we entered into arrangements to 
transition our economic hedges of the deferred compensation 
plan liabilities from equity securities to derivative instruments. 
As a result of this transition, changes in fair value of derivatives 
used to economically hedge the deferred compensation plan are 
reported in personnel expense rather than in net gains (losses) 
from equity securities within noninterest income. For additional 
information on the derivatives used in the economic hedges, see 
Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for technology contracts and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in 2020. 

Occupancy expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower cleaning fees, supplies, and equipment expenses as 
2020 included higher expenses due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
lower rent expense. 

• 

Operating losses decreased driven by lower expense for 
customer remediation accruals and litigation accruals, partially 
offset by a $250 million civil money penalty associated with the 
September 2021 OCC enforcement action. 

Professional and outside services expense decreased driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and 
contractors. 

Leases expense decreased driven by lower depreciation expense 
from the reduction in the size of our operating lease asset 
portfolio. 

Restructuring charges decreased due to lower personnel costs 
related to our efficiency initiatives that began in third quarter 
2020. For additional information on restructuring charges, see 
Note 22 (Restructuring Charges) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Other expenses increased driven by a write-down of goodwill in 
2021 related to the sale of our student loan portfolio. 

Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was $5.6 billion in 2021, compared with an 
income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, driven by higher pre-
tax income. The effective income tax rate was 20.6% for 2021, 
compared with (52.1)% for 2020. The effective income tax rate 
for 2021 reflected the impact of higher pre-tax income while the 
effective income tax rate for 2020 reflected both the impact of 
income tax benefits (including tax credits) on lower pre-tax 
income and income tax benefits related to the resolution and 
reevaluation of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state 
tax authorities. The income tax expense (benefit) and our 
effective income tax rate for both years reflected the impact of 
changes in accounting policy for certain tax-advantaged 
investments adopted in second quarter 2021. For additional 
information on income taxes, see Note 23 (Income Taxes) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 7. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed by 
our Chief Executive Officer and Operating Committee. The 
management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and 
includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for 
asset/liability management, shared revenues and expenses, and 
taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income

from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management 
to assess performance consistently across the operating 
segments. 

In February 2021, we announced an agreement to sell 
WFAM, and in first quarter 2021, we moved the business from 
the Wealth and Investment Management operating segment to 
Corporate. In March 2021, we announced an agreement to sell 
our Corporate Trust Services business and, in second quarter 
2021, we moved the business from the Commercial Banking 
operating segment to Corporate. Prior period balances have been 
revised to conform with the current period presentation. These 
changes did not impact the previously reported consolidated 
financial results of the Company. On November 1, 2021, we 
closed the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and 
WFAM. 

In second quarter 2021, we elected to change our 

accounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) 
investments and elected to change the presentation of 
investment tax credits related to solar energy investments. 
These accounting policy changes had a nominal impact on 
reportable operating segment results. Prior period financial 
statement line items for the Company, as well as for the 
reportable operating segments, have been revised to conform 
with the current period presentation. Our LIHTC investments are 
included in the Corporate and Investment Banking operating 
segment and our solar energy investments are included in the 
Commercial Banking operating segment. For additional 
information, see the “Overview – Recent Developments” section 
and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Table 7:  Management Reporting Structure 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that 
return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess a 
reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital active 
customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans held for sale. 
Excludes nonaccrual loans. 
Beginning in second quarter 2020, customer payment deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed the recognition of delinquencies for those customers 
who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

Full year 2021 vs. full year 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher mortgage banking noninterest income due to higher 
gains in 2021 related to the resecuritization of loans we 
purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 2020, 
losses in 2020 driven by the impact of interest rate volatility 
on hedging activities and valuation losses due to the impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on market conditions, and a shift 
in production to more retail loans, which have a higher 
production margin compared with correspondent loans; 
higher card fees reflecting higher interchange fees driven by 
increased purchase and transaction volumes, partially offset 
by higher rewards, including promotional offers on our new 
Active CashSM card; and 
higher deposit-related fees driven by higher consumer 
transaction volumes as 2020 included reduced volumes due 
to the economic slowdown associated with the COVID-19 
pandemic;

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting a lower deposit spread 
and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher deposit 
balances; and 
lower other income driven by lower gains on the sales of 
certain residential mortgage loans which were reclassified to 
held for sale. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improved 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for customer 
remediation accruals and litigation accruals; 
lower personnel expense reflecting additional payments 
made in 2020 to certain customer-facing and support 
employees and for back-up child care services, as well as 
lower branch staffing expense in 2021 related to efficiency 
initiatives in Consumer and Small Business Banking, partially

Full year 2021 vs. full year 2020 

Total loans (average and period-end) decreased as paydowns 
exceeded originations. Home Lending loan balances were also 
impacted by actions taken in 2020 to temporarily curtail certain 
non-conforming residential mortgage originations and suspend 
home equity originations. Small Business period-end loan 
balances were also impacted by a decline in PPP loans. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer customers 
reflecting government stimulus programs and payment deferral 
programs, as well as continued economic uncertainty associated 
with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improved 
economic environment. 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting lower loan balances 
driven by weak demand and the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher income from higher 
deposit balances; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher other noninterest income due to higher realized and 
unrealized gains on the sales of equity securities and higher 
income from renewable energy investments; and 
higher deposit-related fees due to higher treasury 
management fees driven by an increase in transaction 
volumes and repricing. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower spending related to efficiency initiatives, including 
lower personnel expense from reduced headcount; 
lower lease expense driven by lower depreciation expense 
from a reduction in the size of our operating lease asset 
portfolio; and 
lower professional and outside services expense reflecting 
decreased project-related expense.

Total loans (average) decreased driven by lower loan demand, 
including lower line utilization, and higher paydowns reflecting 
continued high levels of client liquidity and strength in the capital 
markets, partially offset by modest loan growth in late 2021 
driven by higher line utilization, as well as customer growth. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased due to 
higher levels of liquidity and lower investment spending 
reflecting government stimulus programs and continued 
economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower net gains from trading activities driven by lower 
volumes of interest rate products, lower client trading 
activity for equity products due to market volatility in 2020, 
and lower client trading activity for credit products 
reflecting greater market liquidity in 2020 from government 
actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
partially offset by higher client trading activity for asset-
backed finance products; 

• 

•

Wells Fargo & Company 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher investment banking fees due to higher debt 
underwriting fees, including loan syndication fees, as well as 
higher advisory fees and equity underwriting fees; 
higher other noninterest income driven by higher 
commercial mortgage banking income due to higher 
servicing income and gains on the sales of mortgage loans, 
as well as higher income from low-income housing 
investments; and 
higher lending-related fees reflecting increased loan 
commitment fees. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improved 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for litigation 
accruals; 
lower expenses from operations and enterprise functions; 
and 

• 

• 

lower professional and outside services expense driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants 
and contractors; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher incentive 
compensation expense.

NM – Not meaningful 
(1) 

Represents annualized segment total revenue divided by average total financial and wealth advisors for the period. 

Full year 2021 vs. full year 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

• 

higher investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to higher market valuations on WIM advisory assets; and 
higher gains on deferred compensation plan investments, 
which are included in other noninterest income (largely 
offset by personnel expense); 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, partially offset by higher deposit and loan 
balances. 

Provision for credit losses decreased driven by an improved 
economic environment. 

Noninterest expense increased due to: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation expense and higher deferred compensation 
expense; and 
the reversal of a software licensing liability accrual in 2020; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower professional and outside services expense driven by 
efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants 
and contractors. 

Total loans (average and period-end) increased due to higher 
securities-based loan balances. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased primarily due 
to growth in customer balances in both The Private Bank and 
Wells Fargo Advisors.

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers, as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 8h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business for the years ended 
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Management believes that 
advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, 
investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts 
may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. 

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 

the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 
basis points.

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 
Beginning in first quarter 2021, employees who were notified of displacement remained as headcount in their respective operating segment rather than included in Corporate. 

Full year 2021 vs. full year 2020 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity securities 
from our affiliated venture capital and private equity 
businesses, higher realized gains on the sales of equity 
securities, as well as lower impairment of equity securities 
due to improved market conditions in 2021; and 
gains on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business, 
our student loan portfolio, and WFAM; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower net interest income reflecting the lower interest rate 
environment, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting 
results, and lower loan balances; 
lower gains on debt securities from sales of agency MBS and 
municipal bonds, partially offset by higher gains on sales of 
corporate and other debt securities; 
lower asset-based fees due to the sale of WFAM on 
November 1, 2021; 
lower lease income driven by a $268 million impairment of 
certain rail cars in our rail car leasing business used for the 
transportation of coal products; and 
higher valuation losses related to the retained litigation risk, 
including the timing and amount of final settlement, 
associated with shares of Visa Class B common stock that 
we previously sold. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Provision for credit losses increased due to a reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses in 2020 as a result of the 
reclassification of our student loan portfolio to loans held for 
sale, partially offset by an improved economic environment. 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
lower restructuring charges; and 
• 
• 
lower expenses related to divested businesses; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher incentive compensation expense, including the 
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based 
compensation; 
higher deferred compensation expense; and 
a write-down of goodwill in 2021 related to the sale of our 
student loan portfolio. 

• 
• 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets (as a lessor) of $5.1 billion, 
which was net of $2.1 billion of accumulated depreciation, as of 
December 31, 2021. The average age of our rail cars is 22 years 
and the rail cars are typically leased under short-term leases of 
3 to 5 years. Our three largest concentrations, which represented 
55% of our rail car fleet as of December 31, 2021, were rail cars 
used for the transportation of agricultural grain, coal, and 
cement/sand products. 

In 2021, we observed that a decline in the market led to 

continued weakening demand for certain rail cars used for the 
transportation of coal products. We expect that both utilization 
and rental rates for these leased rail cars may remain low in 
future periods and, therefore, we recognized an impairment 
charge related to these leased rail cars of $268 million in fourth 
quarter 2021 as an offset to our lease income, which is included 
in noninterest income. We believe no other classes of rail cars 
were impaired as of December 31, 2021. Additional impairment 
may result in the future based on changing economic and market 
conditions affecting the long-term demand and utility of specific 
types of rail cars. Our assumptions for impairment are sensitive 
to estimated utilization and rental rates, as well as the estimated

economic life of the leased asset. For additional information on 
the accounting for impairment of operating lease assets, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 5 
(Leasing Activity) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

In addition, Corporate includes assets under management 
(AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) for Institutional 

Retirement and Trust (IRT) client assets of $19 billion and 
$582 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021, which we 
continue to administer at the direction of the buyer pursuant to a 
transition services agreement. The transition services agreement 
terminates in June 2022.

Total assets (period-end) decreased modestly reflecting the 
timing of cash deployment by our investment portfolio near the 
end of 2021, partially offset by an increase in equity securities 
related to our affiliated venture capital business. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased reflecting 
actions taken to manage under the asset cap. 

Total assets (average) increased due to: 
• 

an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 
managed by corporate treasury as a result of an increase in 
deposits from the reportable operating segments; and 
an increase in held-to-maturity debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; 

partially offset by: 
• 

a decline in available-for-sale debt securities related to 
portfolio rebalancing to manage liquidity and interest rate 
risk; and 
a decline in loans due to the sale of our student loan 
portfolio.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM) Assets Under 
Management  On November 1, 2021 we closed our previously 
announced agreement to sell WFAM. Prior to the sale, we earned 
investment advisory and other asset-based fees from managing 
and administering assets through WFAM, which offered 
Wells Fargo proprietary mutual funds and managed institutional 
separate accounts. Generally, we earned fees from AUM where 
we had discretionary management authority over the 
investments and generated fees as a percentage of the market 

value of the AUM. WFAM assets under management consisted of 
equity, alternative, balanced, fixed income, money market, and 
stable value, and included client assets that were managed or 
sub-advised on behalf of other Wells Fargo lines of business. 
Table 8k presents WFAM AUM activity for the years ended 
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Management believes that 
AUM is a useful metric because it allows management, investors, 
and others to assess how changes in asset amounts may impact 
the generation of certain asset-based fees.

held-to-maturity debt securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

Table 9 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities increased from December 31, 
2020. We continued to purchase AFS and HTM debt securities, 
including HTM debt securities through securitizations of LHFS, 
which more than offset portfolio runoff and AFS debt security 
sales. In addition, we transferred $56.0 billion of AFS debt 
securities to HTM debt securities in 2021 due to actions taken to 
reposition the overall portfolio for capital management 
purposes. 

The total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt 
securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher 
interest rates. 

At December 31, 2021, 98% of the combined AFS and HTM 

debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are 
based on external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-
for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and 
HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by 
security type. 

in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt 
securities. The size and composition of our AFS and HTM debt 
securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity and interest 
rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt securities 
portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the 
normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in 
our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall 
economic or market conditions, which could influence loan 
origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances and 
mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be 
rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk 
management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and 
interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt 
securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other 
short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for additional information 
on liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. 
states and political subdivisions and highly rated collateralized 
loan obligations (CLOs). 

The HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. 
states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Our 
intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the 
contractual cash flows. Debt securities are classified as HTM 
through purchases or through transfers from the AFS debt 
securities portfolio.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 10 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased from 
December 31, 2020, predominantly due to an increase in the 
commercial and industrial loan portfolio, driven by higher loan 
demand resulting in increased originations and loan draws, 
partially offset by paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness. Consumer 

loans decreased from December 31, 2020, predominantly driven 
by a decrease in the residential mortgage – first lien portfolio due 
to loan paydowns reflecting the low interest rate environment 
and the transfer of $17.8 billion of first lien mortgage loans to 
loans held for sale (LHFS) substantially all of which related to the 
sales of loans purchased from GNMA loan securitization pools in 
prior periods, partially offset by originations of $72.6 billion.

Deposits 
Deposits increased from December 31, 2020, reflecting: 
• 

higher levels of liquidity and savings for consumer 
customers reflecting government stimulus programs and 
payment deferral programs, as well as continued economic 
uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; 

partially offset by: 
• 

actions taken to manage under the asset cap resulting in 
declines in time deposits, such as brokered certificates of 

deposit (CDs), and interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S. 
offices. 

Table 12 provides additional information regarding deposits. 

Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest 
income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include commitments to lend and purchase debt and equity 
securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, 
derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are 
designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) 
manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify 
our funding sources. 

Commitments to Lend 
We enter into commitments to lend to customers, which are 
usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we enter into commitments, 
we are exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk for these 
commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments are 
not funded. For additional information, see Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 13 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 13 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
 
Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

Risk is Part of our Business Model.  Risk is the possibility of an 
event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability 
to achieve its strategic or business objectives. The Company 
routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its 
customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest 
rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, 
such as operational risk, which includes compliance and model 
risks, and strategic and reputation risks. 

Risk Profile.  The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the 
aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and 
business activities after taking into consideration risk 
management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk 
profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. 

Risk Capacity.  Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that 
the Company could assume given its current level of resources 
before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital 
and liquidity needs. 

Risk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the amount of risk, within its risk 
capacity, the Company is comfortable taking given its current 
level of resources. Risk appetite is articulated in our Statement of 
Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable risks and at what 
level and includes risk appetite principles. The Company’s 
Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior management, 
approved at least annually by the Board, and helps guide the 
Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company continuously 
monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews reports which 
include risk appetite information and analysis. 

Risk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the 
Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the 
Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, 
develops options to address them, and evaluates the risks and 
trade-offs of each. The Company’s risk profile, risk capacity, risk 
appetite, and risk management effectiveness are considered in 
the strategic planning process, which is closely linked with the 
Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s Independent 
Risk Management (IRM) organization participates in strategic 
planning, providing challenge to and independent assessment of 
the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM also 
independently assesses and challenges the impact of the 
strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk 
management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, 
enterprise functions, and aggregate Company level. After review, 
the strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s 
evaluation. 

Risk and Climate Change.  The Company is committed to helping 
mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities 
and to partner with key stakeholders, including communities and 
customers, to do the same. The Company expects that climate 
change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the 
Company will continue to integrate climate considerations into 
its risk management framework as its understanding of climate 
change and risks driven by it evolve. 

Risk is Managed by Everyone.  Every employee, in the course of 
their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing 
risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, 
including establishing and maintaining the Company’s control 
environment. Every employee must comply with applicable laws, 
regulations, and Company policies. 

Risk and Culture.  Senior management sets the tone at the top 
by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s 
expectations, that guides how employees conduct themselves 
and make decisions. The Board holds senior management 
accountable for establishing and maintaining this culture and for 
effectively managing risk. Senior management expects 
employees to speak up when they see something that could 
cause harm to the Company’s customers, communities, 
employees, shareholders, or reputation. Because risk 
management is everyone’s responsibility, all employees are 
empowered to and expected to challenge risk decisions when 
appropriate and to escalate their concerns when they have not 
been addressed. The Company’s performance management and 
incentive compensation programs are designed to establish a 
balanced framework for risk and reward under core principles 
that employees are expected to know and practice. The Board, 
through its Human Resources Committee, plays an important 
role in overseeing and providing credible challenge to the 
Company’s performance management and incentive 
compensation programs. Effective risk management is a central 
component of employee performance evaluations. 

Risk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk 
management framework sets forth the Company’s core 
principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by 
the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. 
Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by 
building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We 
continue to enhance our risk management programs, including 
our operational and compliance risk management as required by 
the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s April 20, 2018, 
consent orders. 

Risk Governance 
Role of the Board.  The Board oversees the Company’s business, 
including its risk management. It assesses senior management’s 
performance and holds senior management accountable for 
maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management 
program. 

Board Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk 
oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. 
The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk 
management framework and oversees management’s 
implementation of the framework, including how the Company 
manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the 
Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk 
Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of 
IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee 
and administratively to the CEO.

Risk Management (continued) 

Management Committee Structure.  The Company has 
established management committees, including those focused 
on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance 
and risk management responsibilities. One type of management 
committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-
making body that operates for a particular purpose and may 
report to a Board committee. 

Each management governance committee, in accordance 

with its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make 
decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging 

risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review 
and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and 
remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key 
challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues 
as appropriate. 

Table 14 presents, as of December 31, 2021, the structure 

of the Company’s Board committees and management 
governance committees reporting to a Board committee, 
including relevant reporting and escalation paths.

The Audit Committee additionally oversees the internal audit function; external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and the disclosure framework for financial, regulatory and risk 
reports prepared for the Board, management, and bank regulatory agencies; and assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 

Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk 
Committee of the Board.  The Enterprise Risk & Control 
Committee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that 
governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives 
information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated 
risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC 
also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to 
the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives 
regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management 
regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management program. 

The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, and its 

membership is comprised of principal line of business and certain 
enterprise function heads. The Chief Auditor or a designee 
attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct 
escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also escalates 
certain human capital risks and issues to the Human Resources 
Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate anything directly 
to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC in 
accordance with the Company’s escalation management policy. 
Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a 
risk and control committee, which is a management governance 
committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its 
scope limited to the respective principal line of business or 
enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider 

risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise 
function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line 
of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. 
As a complement to these risk and control committees, 
management governance committees dedicated to specific risk 
types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more 
comprehensive governance of risks. 

Risk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities 
The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the 
Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. 
• 

Front Line  The Front Line, which comprises principal line of 
business and certain enterprise function activities, is the first 
line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for 
understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying 
adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its 
business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and 
assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated 
by or associated with its business activities and balances risk 
and reward in decision making while operating within the 
Company’s risk appetite. 
Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of 
defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk 
management program and provides oversight, including 
challenge to and independent assessment of, the Front 
Line’s execution of its risk management responsibilities. 

• 

32 

Wells Fargo & Company 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 

Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is 
responsible for acting as an independent assurance function 
and validates that the risk management program is 
adequately designed and functioning effectively. 

Risk Type Classifications 
The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and 
ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs 
and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit 
the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, 
including emerging risk exposures. 

Operational Risk Management 
Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this 
section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems, or from external events. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for all aspects of operational risk, including 
significant supporting programs and/or policies regarding the 
Company’s business resiliency and disaster recovery, data 
management, information security, technology, and third-party 
risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the 
Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant 
operational risk policies and oversees the Company’s operational 
risk management program. 

At the management level, Operational Risk Management, 

which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational 
risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and 
provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s 
oversight responsibilities include change management risk, 
human capital risk, technology risk, third-party risk, information 
management risk, information security risk, data management 
risk, and fraud risk. 

Information security is a significant operational risk for 

financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the risk 
arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction of information or information 
systems. The Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the 
Company’s information security risk management and cyber 
defense programs. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for information security risk and 
approves the Company’s information security program, which 
includes the information security policy and the cyber defense 
program. A Technology Subcommittee of the Risk Committee 
assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of technology, 
information security, and cybersecurity risks as well as data 
management risk. The Technology Subcommittee reviews and 
recommends to the Risk Committee for approval any significant 
programs and/or policies supporting information security risk 
(including cybersecurity risk), technology risk, and data 
management risk. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as their 

third- party service providers, continue to be the target of 
various evolving and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware, 
ransomware, other malicious software intended to exploit 
hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential 
validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to 
disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their 
cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, 
proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also 
focused on targeting online applications and services, such as 
online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and 
services provided by third parties, and have targeted the 

infrastructure of the internet causing the widespread 
unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As 
a result, information security and the continued development 
and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems 
designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data 
from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for 
Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is also proactively involved in industry 
cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, including 
our third-party service providers and governmental agencies, to 
continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to 
cybersecurity and other information security threats. See the 
“Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional information 
regarding the risks associated with a failure or breach of our 
operational or security systems or infrastructure, including as a 
result of cyber attacks. 

Compliance Risk Management 
Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting 
from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and 
rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately 
address associated impact, including to customers. Compliance 
risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, 
program requirements, procedures, and standards related to 
ethical principles applicable to the banking industry. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial 
crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s 
Risk Committee reviews and approves significant supporting 
compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs 
and oversees the Company’s compliance risk management and 
financial crimes risk management programs. 

Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of 

inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of 
employees or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, 
caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business 
practices. In connection with its oversight of conduct risk, the 
Board oversees the alignment of employee conduct to the 
Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility 
for conduct risk and risk management components of the 
Company’s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board’s 
Human Resources Committee include oversight of the 
Company’s culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, 
human capital management (including talent management and 
succession planning), performance management program, and 
incentive compensation risk management program. 

At the management level, the Compliance function, which is 

part of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company’s 
compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk 
Management, which is part of the Compliance function, oversees 
and monitors financial crimes risk. The Compliance function 
reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to 
compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Model Risk Management 
Model risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the 
potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based 
on model output that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the 
Company’s model risk management policy, model governance, 
model performance, model issue remediation status, and 
adherence to model risk appetite metrics.

Risk Management (continued) 

At the management level, the Model Risk function, which is 

part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for model risk and is 
responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of model 
risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports to the 
CRO and provides periodic reports related to model risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. 

Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity arising 
from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of 
strategic initiatives, or inadequate responses to changes in the 
external operating environment. 

The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic 

planning and oversees management’s development and 
implementation of and approves the Company’s strategic plan, 
and considers whether it is aligned with the Company’s risk 
appetite and risk management effectiveness. Management 
develops, executes and recommends significant strategic 
corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management’s 
proposals, including their impact on the Company’s risk profile 
and financial position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the 
adequacy of the Company’s strategic risk management program, 
including associated risk management practices, processes and 
controls. The Board’s Risk Committee also receives updates from 
management regarding new business initiatives activity and risks 
related to new or changing products, as appropriate. 

At the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight 

function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight function reports into 
the CRO and supports periodic reports related to strategic risk 
provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Reputation Risk Management 
Reputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that 
negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the 
Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely 
impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, 
cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. 
Stakeholders include employees, customers, communities, 
shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and 
media organizations. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for reputation risk, while each Board committee 
has reputation risk oversight responsibilities related to their 
primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives reports 
from management that help it monitor how effectively the 
Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the 
Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports 
from management relating to stakeholder perceptions of the 
Company. 

At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight 
function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight function reports 
into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to reputation 
risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 

of the Company’s assets and exposures such as loans, debt 
securities, and certain derivatives. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk 
Committee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of 
credit risk. At the management level, Credit Risk, which is part of 
IRM, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Credit Risk 
reports to the CRO and supports periodic reports related to 
credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit 
Subcommittee. 

Loan Portfolio  Our loan portfolios represent the largest 
component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which 
we have credit risk. Table 15 presents our total loans outstanding 
by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into its credit risk management activities. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and monitoring 
our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks delinquencies, 
collateral values, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, economic 
trends by geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain 
portfolios (typically commercial) and other indications of credit 
risk. Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable 
early identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 4 (Loans and 
Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in 
this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for 
each of the following portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING 
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

We had $13.0 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2021, 
compared with $19.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The change 
was driven by decreases in the oil, gas and pipelines, retail, 
transportation services, and entertainment and recreation 
industries, as these industries continue to recover from the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio increased at December 31, 2021, compared 
with December 31, 2020, driven by higher loan demand resulting 
in increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by 
paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness. Table 16 provides our 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry. 
The industry categories are based on the North American 
Industry Classification System. 

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality in 2021 reflected 
continued improvement in the economic environment. In 
particular: 
•  Nonaccrual loans were $7.2 billion at December 31, 2021, 
down from $8.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Commercial 
nonaccrual loans decreased to $2.4 billion at December 31, 
2021, compared with $4.8 billion at December 31, 2020, and 
consumer nonaccrual loans increased to $4.8 billion at 
December 31, 2021, compared with $3.9 billion at 
December 31, 2020. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.81% of 
total loans at December 31, 2021, compared with 0.98% at 
December 31, 2020. 

•  Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of our average 

• 

commercial and consumer loan portfolios were 0.06% and 
0.33%, respectively, in 2021, compared with 0.31% and 
0.39%, respectively, in 2020. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were 
$235 million and $424 million in our commercial and 
consumer portfolios, respectively, at December 31, 2021, 
compared with $78 million and $612 million at 
December 31, 2020. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $(4.2) billion in 

• 

2021, compared with $14.0 billion in 2020. 
The ACL for loans decreased to $13.8 billion, or 1.54% of 
total loans, at December 31, 2021, compared with 
$19.7 billion, or 2.22%, at December 31, 2020. 

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit 

quality trends follows. 

COVID-Related Lending Accommodations  During 2021, we 
provided customers with residential mortgage loan payment 
deferrals of up to 18 months in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. At December 31, 2021, approximately $1.1 billion of 
unpaid principal balance related to residential mortgage loans, 
excluding those insured by the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA), remained in a deferral period. 

Based on guidance in the CARES Act and the Interagency 

Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial 
Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus 
(Revised) issued by federal banking regulators in April 2020 (the 
Interagency Statement), both of which we elected to apply, loan 
modifications related to COVID-19 and that meet certain other 
criteria are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) 
classification. The TDR relief provided by the CARES Act 
guidance is no longer available after January 1, 2022; however, 
certain COVID-related lending accommodations may continue to 
be eligible for TDR relief under the Interagency Statement. At 
December 31, 2021, the majority of residential mortgage loans 
that were in a deferral period, excluding those that were 
government insured/guaranteed, met the criteria for TDR relief 
and were therefore not classified as TDRs. 

Customers who were current prior to entering the deferral 
period and confirmed their ability to return to their contractual 
loan payments upon exiting the deferral period will remain on 
accrual status. Customers who are unable to resume making their 
contractual loan payments upon exiting the deferral period are 
generally placed on nonaccrual status until they perform for a 
period of time. Such customers may require further assistance 
after exiting from these deferral programs and may receive or be 
eligible to receive modifications, or may be charged-off in 
accordance with our policies. For additional information about 
our COVID-related modifications, see Note 1 (Summary of

(1) 
Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit. 
(2)  No other single industry had total loans in excess of $3.1 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Loans to financials except banks, our largest industry 

concentration, is predominantly comprised of loans to 
investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, rental 
and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment banks. 
We had $93.6 billion and $80.0 billion of loans originated by our 
Asset Backed Finance (ABF) and Financial Institution Group (FIG) 
lines of business at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
These loans include: (i) loans to customers related to their 
subscription or capital calls, (ii) loans to nonbank lenders 
collateralized by commercial loans, and (iii) loans to originators or 
servicers of financial assets collateralized by residential real 
estate or other consumer loans such as credit cards, auto loans 
and leases, student loans and other financial assets eligible for 
the securitization market. These ABF and FIG loans are limited to 
a percentage of the value of the underlying financial assets 
considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing 
performance. These ABF and FIG loans may also have other 
features to manage credit risk such as cross-collateralization, 
credit enhancements, and contractual re-margining of collateral 
supporting the loans. In addition, loans to financials except banks 
included collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form, all of 
which were rated AA or above, of $8.1 billion and $7.9 billion at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Oil, gas and pipelines loans included $5.8 billion and 

$7.5 billion of senior secured loans outstanding at December 31, 
2021 and 2020, respectively. Oil, gas and pipelines nonaccrual 
loans decreased at December 31, 2021, compared with 
December 31, 2020, driven by loan paydowns. 

We continue to perform enhanced credit monitoring for 

certain industries that we consider to be directly and 
most adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio also includes non-U.S. loans of $78.0 billion and 
$63.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. loans at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, included: 
• 

$46.7 billion and $36.2 billion in the financials except banks 
category; 
$15.9 billion and $12.8 billion in the banks category; and 
$1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines 
category. 

• 
• 

Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of 

repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering 
into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to perform under the 
agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to 
thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide 
additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or 
additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of 
collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to 
repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside 
repayment guarantee in providing the extension. 

Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly 

related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and 
willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 
more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with 
the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance 
for credit losses methodology.

In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate 
the collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated 
support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the 
strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full 
repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely 
collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the 
performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual 
status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in 
accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net 
realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE loans 
to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and 
collateral quality ratings. We had $13.1 billion of CRE mortgage 
loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2021, compared 
with $12.0 billion at December 31, 2020, and $1.7 billion of CRE 
construction loans classified as criticized at December 31, 2021, 
compared with $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase 
in criticized CRE mortgage and construction loans was driven by 
the hotel/motel, apartment, and institutional property types and 

Table 17:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

reflected the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due 
to uncertainty in the recovery from the economic impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the credit quality of certain property types 
within our CRE loan portfolio, such as retail, hotel/motel, office 
buildings, and shopping centers, could continue to be adversely 
affected. 

The total CRE loan portfolio increased $4.3 billion from 

December 31, 2020, driven by an increase in CRE mortgage loans 
predominantly related to apartments, 1-4 family structure, 
hotel/motel, and industrial property types, partially offset by a 
decrease in CRE construction loans. The CRE loan portfolio 
included $8.7 billion of non-U.S. CRE loans at December 31, 
2021. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by 
property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE 
loans are in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which 
combined represented 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The 
largest property type concentrations are office buildings at 25% 
and apartments at 22% of the portfolio.

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At December 31, 2021, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$86.9 billion, representing approximately 10% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $72.9 billion, or 
approximately 8% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at 
December 31, 2020. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of 

our total consolidated assets at both December 31, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers,

counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay, 
which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on the borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

December 31, 2021, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$36.0 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and 
included $7.9 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch. 

Table 18:  Select Country Exposures 

Table 18 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 18: 
• 

Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and deposits with non-U.S. 
banks. These balances are presented prior to the deduction 
of allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the 
terms of the credit agreements, if any. 
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of 
non-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and 
net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
•  Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange 
contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, 
and securities lending agreements.

Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $47.7 billion exposure to financial institutions and $47.4 billion to non-financial corporations at December 31, 2021. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is comprised of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans comprised 94% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 
2021, compared with 92% at December 31, 2020. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes some loans 

with adjustable-rate features and some with an interest-only 
feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans were 
approximately 3% of total loans at both December 31, 2021, and 
December 31, 2020. We believe our origination process 
appropriately addresses our adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) 
reset risk across our residential mortgage loans and our ACL for 
loans considers this risk. We do not offer option ARM products, 
nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed 
payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial 
services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. 
These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only 

payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar 
features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit 
performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio 
for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity 
of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan 
is delinquent. 

Our residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior 

lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with 
variable interest rate and payment options available during the 
draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding 
principal balance plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2021, 
lines of credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-only 
option. The lines that enter their amortization period may 
experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased risk in our ACL estimate. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 

38 

Wells Fargo & Company 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a 
fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing 
payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end 
of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an 
amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to 
30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines 
and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which 
requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of 
the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully 
amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment 
increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the 
outstanding balance. 

In anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit 
borrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment, we 
have created a program to inform, educate and help these 
borrowers transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing 
payments or full repayment. We monitor the performance of the 
borrowers moving through the program in an effort to refine our 
ongoing program strategy. 

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 
economic or market conditions for all geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based 
tools used to estimate the market value of homes. AVMs are a 
lower-cost alternative to appraisals and support valuations of 
large numbers of properties in a short period of time using 
market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The 
primary risk associated with the use of AVMs is that the value of 
an individual property may vary significantly from the average for 
the market area. We have processes to periodically validate 
AVMs and specific risk management guidelines addressing the 
circumstances when AVMs may be used. Additional information 
about appraisals, AVMs, and our policy for their use can be found 
in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. 
CLTV represents the ratio of the total loan balance of first and 
junior lien mortgages (including unused line amounts for credit 
line products) to property collateral value. Excluding government 
insured/guaranteed loans, these credit risk indicators on the 
residential mortgage portfolio were: 
• 

Loans 30 days or more delinquent at December 31, 2021, 
totaled $3.3 billion, or 1% of residential mortgage loans, 
compared with $4.7 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020; 
Lines of credit in their draw period that were 30 days or 
more past due were $293 million, or 2% of such lines, at 
December 31, 2021, and $381 million, or 2%, at 
December 31, 2020, compared with amortizing lines of 
credit that were 30 days or more past due of $395 million, or 
7% of such lines, at December 31, 2021, and $378 million, or 
5%, at December 31, 2020; 

• 

• 

• 

Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 totaled $3.8 billion, 
or 1% of residential mortgage loans, at December 31, 2021, 
compared with $5.6 billion, or 2%, at December 31, 2020; 
and 
Loans with a LTV/CLTV greater than 100% totaled 
$465 million at December 31, 2021, or less than 1% of 
residential mortgage loans, compared with $1.6 billion, or 
1%, at December 31, 2020. 

With respect to residential mortgage – junior lien loans that had a 
CLTV greater than 100%: 
• 

Such loans totaled 1% of the junior lien portfolio at 
December 31, 2021, compared with 3% at December 31, 
2020; and 
3% were 30 days or more delinquent at both December 31, 
2021, and December 31, 2020. 

• 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of delinquencies. For additional information 
regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 4 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions 
such as interest rate reductions, forbearance of principal, and in 
some cases, principal forgiveness. These programs generally 
include trial payment periods of three to four months, and after 
successful completion and compliance with terms during this 
period, the loan is permanently modified. Loans included under 
these programs are accounted for as TDRs at the start of the trial 
period or at the time of permanent modification, if no trial period 
is used. For additional information on customer 
accommodations, including loan modifications, in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” 
section in this Report. 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $34.4 billion from 
December 31, 2020, driven by loan paydowns reflecting the low 
interest rate environment and the transfer of $17.8 billion of 
first lien mortgage loans to loans held for sale (LHFS) 
substantially all of which related to the sales of loans purchased 
from GNMA loan securitization pools in prior periods, partially 
offset by originations of $72.6 billion.

The net loan charge-off rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $32 million of loan charge-offs related to a change in practice to fully charge-off certain delinquent legacy residential 
mortgage loans. 
Consists of 45 states; no state in Other had loans in excess of $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of 
credit was $22.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The unfunded 
credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $45.6 billion 
at December 31, 2021. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 

of borrowers in our residential mortgage – first and junior lien 
lines of credit portfolios. In December 2021, excluding borrowers 
with COVID-related loan modification payment deferrals: 
Approximately 45% of these borrowers paid only the 
• 
minimum amount due and approximately 50% paid more 
than the minimum amount due. The rest were either 
delinquent or paid less than the minimum amount due. 
For the borrowers with an interest-only payment feature, 
approximately 29% paid only the minimum amount due and 
approximately 66% paid more than the minimum amount 
due.

$28.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $24.4 billion 
at December 31, 2020, driven by an increase in margin loans. 

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
• 

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes 
uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; 
they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential 
mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the 
loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection or 
the loan is in an active payment deferral as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic; 
part of the principal balance has been charged off; or 

• 

• 

• 

for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related 
first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 
process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status. 

Certain nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status 

after they perform for a period of time. Consumer credit card 
loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally fully 
charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due. 

Customer payment deferral activities instituted in response 

to the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to delay the 
recognition of nonaccrual loans for those customers who would 
have otherwise moved into nonaccrual status. For additional 
information on customer accommodations, including loan 
modifications, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related 
Lending Accommodations” section in this Report.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in Accounts Receivable in Other Assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans decreased $2.4 billion from 
December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in commercial and 
industrial nonaccrual loans, as a result of paydowns in the oil, gas, 
and pipelines industry. For additional information on commercial 
nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 
Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans increased $887 million from 
December 31, 2020, predominantly driven by an increase in 
residential mortgage – first lien nonaccrual loans as certain 
customers exited from accommodation programs provided in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers requiring 
further payment assistance after exiting from these programs 
may have their loans modified or may be eligible to receive 
modifications.

Table 23 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

Charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $152 million of loan charge-offs related to a change in practice to fully charge-off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. 

We believe exposure to loss on nonaccrual loans is mitigated 

If interest due on all nonaccrual loans (including loans that 

were, but are no longer on nonaccrual status at year end) had 
been accrued under the original terms, approximately 
$335 million of interest would have been recorded as income on 
these loans, compared with $309 million actually recorded as 
interest income in 2021, versus $329 million and $303 million, 
respectively, in 2020. 

by the following factors at December 31, 2021: 
• 
• 

95% of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured. 
84% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 81% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain. 
99% of total consumer nonaccrual loans are secured, of 
which 95% are secured by real estate and 96% have a 
combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
of the $907 million of consumer loans in bankruptcy or 
discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, 
$675 million were current. 
the remaining risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been 
considered in developing our allowance for loan losses.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  Table 25 provides 
information regarding the recorded investment of loans 
modified in TDRs. TDRs decreased from December 31, 2020, 
predominantly related to commercial and industrial loans and 
residential mortgage – first lien loans. The decrease in 
commercial and industrial loans was primarily due to paydowns in 
the oil, gas, and pipelines industry. The decrease in residential 
mortgage – first lien loans was due to paydowns and transfers to 
LHFS, which related to sales of repurchased loans from GNMA 
loan securitization pools. 

The amount of our TDRs at December 31, 2021, would have 

otherwise been higher without the TDR relief provided by the 

CARES Act and Interagency Statement. Customers who are 
unable to resume making their contractual loan payments upon 
exiting from these deferral programs may require further 
assistance and may receive or be eligible to receive modifications, 
which may be classified as TDRs. For additional information on 
the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Credit Quality 
Overview – COVID-Related Lending Accommodations” section in

In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire 
amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off. When we 
delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal 
(principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance 
if that amount is not considered fully collectible. The allowance 
for loan losses for TDRs was $211 million and $565 million at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Our nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all 

loan types when a restructuring is involved. We may 
re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment 
capacity based on the borrower’s documented income, debt 
to income ratios, and other factors. Loans that are not re-
underwritten or loans that lack sufficient evidence of sustained 
repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged 
down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an 
accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has 
demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the 
underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform 

Table 26:  Analysis of Changes in TDRs 

under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in 
accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual 
status and may be returned to accruing status when the 
borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, 
generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent, 
inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification. 
Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and a 
corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when 
we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the 
modified agreement will not be collectible. See Note 4 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report for additional information regarding TDRs. 

Table 26 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once as a TDR are reported as inflows only in 
the period they are first modified. In addition to foreclosures, 
sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove loans from 
TDR classification, but only if they have been refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualify as a new loan.

(1)  Quarterly net charge-offs as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in 2021, 
compared with the prior year, was due to lower losses and higher 
recoveries in the commercial and industrial portfolio primarily 
driven by the oil, gas, and pipeline industry, and in the real estate 
mortgage portfolio. 

The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in 2021, 
compared with the prior year, was driven by lower losses in the 
credit card portfolio reflecting the impact of government 
stimulus programs instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, improvements in the economic environment and 
better portfolio credit quality, partially offset by $152 million of 
residential mortgage loan charge-offs related to a change in 
practice to fully charge-off certain delinquent legacy residential 
mortgage loans. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the credit 
quality of our loan portfolio. Although the potential impacts were 
considered in our allowance for credit losses for loans, payment 
deferral activities instituted in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to delay the recognition of loan charge-
offs. For additional information on customer accommodations in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Management 

– Credit Risk Management – COVID-Related Lending 
Accommodations” section in this Report. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected life-time credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other 
off-balance sheet credit exposures. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our ACL each quarter. The process for establishing the ACL for 
loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical 
and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and 
loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves 
subjective and complex judgments. In addition, we review a 
variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and 
trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the 
allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional 
information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies –

Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent 

risks inherent in our processes and assumptions such as 
economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments. We also considered the 
significant uncertainty related to the duration and severity of the 
economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
incremental risks to our loan portfolio.

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 28 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

The ACL for loans decreased $5.9 billion, or 30%, from 
December 31, 2020, reflecting better portfolio credit quality and 
continued improvements in current and forecasted economic 
conditions. Total provision for credit losses for loans was 
$(4.2) billion in 2021, compared with $14.0 billion in 2020, 
reflecting continued improvements in the economic 
environment, which led to lower charge-offs and better portfolio 
credit quality. The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by 
portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan 
class) is included in Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for 
Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base 
scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. In our estimate of the ACL for

the downside scenarios to reflect our expectations for overall 
limited economic improvement balanced against the potential

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
GDP), among other factors. There remains uncertainty related to 
the length and severity of the economic impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic, including the possibility of additional variants, and the 
impact of other factors that may influence the level of expected 
losses and associated amounts of the ACL. The COVID-19 
pandemic could continue to impact the recognition of credit 
losses in our loan portfolios and may result in increases or 
decreases in our ACL. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $13.8 billion at 

December 31, 2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total 
loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects 
existing factors as of the date of determination, including 
economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for 
loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is 
possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for 
determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and 
commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private 
label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In 
addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential 
mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed 
by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We 

may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify 
the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of 
the breach. 

In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 

mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a 
mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to 
various representations and warranties that reflect 
management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service 
those loans, based on a combination of factors. See Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information about our 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses. 

We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage 
loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms 
of these programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of actual 
losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 13 (Guarantees 
and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information about our exposure to loss related to 
these programs. 

In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as 
servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial 
mortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage 
securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of 
FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label 
mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans 
owned by institutional investors.

 The loans we service were originated by us or by other 
mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance 
certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the 
mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or 
primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage 
loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of 
taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) 
foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent 
consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider 
alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short 
sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property 
through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of 
the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent 
amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform 
their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of 
reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by 
investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 9 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information about residential and 
commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. 

In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, 

delinquency status continues to advance for loans with COVID-
related payment deferrals, which has resulted in an increase in 
delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase 
in loans eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitization 
pools. Upon transfer as servicer, we retain the option to 
repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which 
becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments 
remain unpaid by the borrower. We generally repurchase these 
loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not 
change. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our repurchases 
of these loans were elevated in 2020, but returned to more

normalized levels in 2021. These repurchased loan balances were 
$17.3 billion and $34.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively, which included $12.9 billion and $29.9 billion, 
respectively, in our held for investment loan portfolio, with the 
remainder in loans held for sale. 

Repurchased loans that regain current status or are 
otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing 
guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization 
pools. However, in accordance with guidance issued by GNMA, 
certain loans repurchased after June 30, 2020, are ineligible for 
inclusion in future GNMA loan securitization pools until the 
borrower has timely made six consecutive payments. This 
requirement may delay our ability to resell loans into the 
securitization market. See Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information about our involvement with mortgage 
loan securitizations. 

Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master 

servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify 
the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or 
master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, 
if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master 
servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not 
cured within a specified period. The standards governing 
servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible 
remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those 
standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides 
maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and 
individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs 
from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification 
or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in 
connection with our servicing activities, we could become subject 
to consent orders and settlement agreements with federal and 
state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices. In 
general, these can require us to provide customers with loan 
modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure prevention 
and assistance, and can result in business restrictions or the 
imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. For example, on 
September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the execution, 
risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its 
Home Lending business. For additional information on the OCC 
consent order, see the “Overview” section in this Report. 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of the Board, which oversees the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 
Primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. 

At the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability 
Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management 
from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and 
supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance 
Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in 
more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate 
management level oversight specific to market risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is created in our role as a 
financial intermediary for customers based on investments such 
as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities. 

Interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings. 
We are subject to interest rate risk because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different 
times. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest 
rates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by 
different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
by different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield 
curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs 
differently; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if 
long-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, MBS 
held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a 
slower rate than anticipated, which could impact portfolio 
income; or 
interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan 
demand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage 
origination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other 
financial instruments. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 

various net interest income simulations using many interest rate 
scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the 
degree of change over time, the speed of change and the 
projected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require 
assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans 
and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing 
strategies. 

Our most recent simulations, as presented in Table 30, 
estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months 
using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both 
lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. 
Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in 
the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors 
three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and 
short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three 
years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at 
0.00%. The following describes the simulation assumptions for 
the scenarios presented in Table 30: 
• 

Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to 
our assets and liabilities. 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

•  Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes 
consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Deposit 
mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across 
the alternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, 
customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher-
yielding products could impact expected net interest 
income. 

•  Deposit rates paid may change with market interest rate 

changes. Our interest rate sensitivity of deposits, referred to 
as deposit betas, is modeled using the historical behavior of 
our deposits portfolio. The actual deposit rates paid may 
differ from the assumed deposit rates paid in these 
scenarios due to lags in repricing and other factors. 

•  We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities 

portfolios constant across scenarios.

The interest rate sensitivity included in Table 30 indicates 
that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our 
assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets 
would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. For the 
simulations with downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00% 
interest rate floor limits the amount of the decline in net interest 
income. We may have a larger decline in net interest income 
when interest rates increase for the base scenario relative to the 
interest rate floor. 

The sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest 

income or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive 
noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by 
mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite 
direction of our net interest income. Mortgage originations 
generally decline in response to higher interest rates and 
generally increase in response to lower interest rates, particularly 
refinancing activity. Mortgage banking results are also impacted 
by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the 
“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for 
additional information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from 
changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that 
reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally, 
our trading assets are (before the effects of certain economic 
hedges) generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than 
the related funding liabilities. As a result, net interest income 
from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest 
rates rise and fall, respectively. The impact to net interest income 
does not include the fair value changes of trading securities, 
which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are 
recorded in noninterest income. For additional information on 
our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

We use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded 

and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage 
our interest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report 
for additional information on the use of the debt securities 
portfolios. The notional or contractual amount, credit risk 
amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our 
interest rate risk exposures as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
are presented in Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in 
two main ways: 
• 

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 

• 

to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. 
Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit 
and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We 
determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or 
held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our 
intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our 
corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also 
retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we 
securitize mortgage loans. 

We typically originate agency residential mortgage loans as 
held for sale and certain prime non-agency residential mortgage 
loans as held for investment. Occasionally, we designate some of 
our agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment and 
non-agency residential mortgage loan originations as held for 
sale in support of future issuances of private label residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We issued $2.2 billion and 
$2.6 billion of RMBS in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Interest rate and market risk can be substantial in our 

mortgage businesses. Changes in interest rates may impact 
origination and servicing fees, the fair value of our residential 
MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate 
“locks”) extended to mortgage applicants, as well as the 
associated income or loss in mortgage banking noninterest 
income, including the gains or losses related to economic hedges 
of MSRs and LHFS. Given the time it takes for customer behavior 
to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required 
for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and 
securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will 
generally affect our mortgage banking noninterest income on a 
lagging basis. The amount and timing of the impact will depend 
on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest 
rates. 

The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly 
subjective and involve complex judgments by management 
about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See the “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage 
Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional 
information. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of 
significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of 
residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns 
and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to 
service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing 
valuation elements. For additional information on mortgage 
banking, including key economic assumptions and the sensitivity 
of the fair value of MSRs, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking 
Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

An increase in interest rates generally reduces the 

propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the 
servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair 
value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also 
reduce mortgage loan demand, which reduces noninterest 
income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates 
would generally have an opposite impact. 

To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our 
residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of 
derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar 
futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest 
rate options. MSR hedging results include a combination of 
directional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any carry

components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are 
monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated 
levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management 
function aggregates and monitors all exposures to ensure risk 
measures are within our established risk appetite. Changes to the 
market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The 
Company monitors various market risk exposure measures from 
a variety of perspectives, including line of business, product, risk 
type, and legal entity. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our 
consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation 
model which assumes that historical changes in market values 
are representative of the potential future outcomes and 
measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 
1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical 
simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 
12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 
12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is 
responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence 
level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur 
single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on 
average once every 100 trading days. 

Average Company Trading General VaR was $49 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $123 million 
for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in average 
Company Trading General VaR for the year ended December 31, 
2021, was driven by market volatility due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, in particular changes in interest rate curves and a 
significant widening of credit spreads exiting the 12-month 
historical look-back window used to calculate VaR. 

income related to mortgage forward contracts. Carry income 
represents accretion from the forward delivery price to the spot 
price including both the yield earned on the reference securities 
and the market implied cost of financing during the period. A 
steep yield curve generally produces higher carry income while a 
flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially 
negative carry income. 

The size of the hedge and the particular combination of 
hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce 
the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a 
range of mortgage interest rates. Because market factors, the 
composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio and the 
relationship between the origination and servicing sides of 
our mortgage businesses change continually, the types of 
instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and 
rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors 
and the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. 

Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage 

banking is a complex process that requires sophisticated 
modeling and constant monitoring. There are several potential 
risks to earnings from mortgage banking related to origination 
volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and associated hedging 
results, the relationship and degree of volatility between short-
term and long-term interest rates, and changes in servicing and 
foreclosures costs. While we attempt to balance our mortgage 
banking interest rate and market risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It also includes price risk in 
the trading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge 
effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book, and 
impairment of private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s 
market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. 
In addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including adjusting 
the Company’s market risk appetite with input from the Finance 
Committee. The Finance Committee also reports key market risk 
matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight 
responsibility for market risk. The Market and Counterparty Risk 
Management function reports into the CRO and provides 
periodic reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance 
Committee. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and to a lesser 
extent other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held for 
trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly 
correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may 
occur on different days. 

Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR 
models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity 
analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the 
measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% 
increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We 
conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, 
volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. 
Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication 
of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market 
moves. 

Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, 
stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to 
extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios 
estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions 
of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe 
credit spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. 
These scenarios assume that the market moves happen 
instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes 
place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative 
approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). 

An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both 

historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad 
range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation 
and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the 
impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio 
values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase 
across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. 
Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress 
scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis 
addresses how these events might affect the risk factors 
relevant to a portfolio. 

The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in 
calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal 
stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated 
to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail 
on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in 
this Report. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
direct investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth 
companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate 
recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that 
make similar private equity investments. These private equity 

investments are made within capital allocations approved by 
management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to 
assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For 
nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts 
and circumstances of each individual investment and the 
expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the 
viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable 
price changes that are similar to the investments held. 
Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private 
equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair 
value through net income, and the measurement alternative. 
In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was 
apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. 
To manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 
through a series of sales, thereby eliminating this position as of 
September 30, 2015. As part of these sales, we agreed to 
compensate the buyer for any additional contributions to a 
litigation settlement fund for the litigation matters associated 
with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure to this retained 
litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is reflected on our 
consolidated balance sheet. For additional information about the 
associated litigation matters, see the “Interchange Litigation” 
section in Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities that include investments 
relating to our venture capital activities. We manage these 
marketable equity securities within capital risk limits approved by 
management and the Board and monitored by Corporate ALCO 
and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value changes in these 
marketable equity securities are recognized in net income. For 
additional information, see Note 6 (Equity Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and

the Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and 
inform future needs in the Company’s funding plan. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  In the ordinary course of business, 
we enter into contractual obligations that may require future 
cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. The objective of effective liquidity management is 
to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. For additional information on these obligations, 
see the following sections and Notes to Financial Statements in 
this Report:

To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity 

guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover 
potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence 
on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are 
monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a 
quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established and 
monitored for both the consolidated company and for the Parent 
on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Parent is a source of 
strength for its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. 
The Parent acts as a source of funding for the Company through 
the issuance of long-term debt and equity, and WFC Holdings, 
LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the 
Parent (the “IHC”), provides funding support for the ongoing 
operational requirements of the Parent and certain of its direct 
and indirect subsidiaries. For additional information on the IHC, 
see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and 
Related Matters” section in this Report. 

Liquidity Stress Tests  Liquidity stress tests are performed to 
help ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet 
contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of 
stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as 
corporate-specific events, including a range of stress conditions 
and time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of

Contingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP), 
which is approved by Corporate ALCO and the Board’s Risk 
Committee, sets out the Company’s strategies and action plans 
to address potential liquidity needs during market-wide or 
idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP establishes measures for 
monitoring emerging liquidity events and describes the 
processes for communicating and managing stress events should 
they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate funding and liquidity 
strategies available to the Company in a period of stress. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the LCR established by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires a 
covered banking organization to hold high-quality liquid assets 
(HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net 
cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our HQLA under the 
rule predominantly consists of central bank deposits, 
government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of 
federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company on a 
consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions 
(IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules 
issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as 
Wells Fargo. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing 

a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such 
as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, 
including common equity, long-term debt and most types of 
deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies 
to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total 
assets of $10 billion or more. As of December 31, 2021, we were 
compliant with the NSFR requirement. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  As of December 31, 2021, the 
consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo 
National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 
100%, which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash 
outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 32 presents 
the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated 
LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule 
requirements.

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, cash 
equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid debt 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity. 
Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in 
composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary 
sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under 
the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the 
exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary IDIs required under 
the LCR rule. Our primary sources of liquidity are presented in 
Table 33 at fair value, which also includes encumbered securities 
that are not included as available HQLA in the calculation of the 
LCR. 

Table 33:  Primary Sources of Liquidity 

Our cash is predominantly on deposit with the Federal 
Reserve. Debt securities included as part of our primary sources 
of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury and federal agency 
debt, and MBS issued by federal agencies within our debt 
securities portfolio. We believe these debt securities provide 
quick sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain 
financing, regardless of market conditions. Some of these debt 
securities are within our HTM portfolio and, as such, are not 
intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 
Table 33, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing of 
other debt securities including trading and/or AFS debt 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans are not 
encumbered. As of December 31, 2021, we also maintained 
approximately $208.2 billion of available borrowing capacity at 
various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve 
Discount Window. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 166% and 158% of total

loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additional 
funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings. Table 34 presents a summary of our short-term 
borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. We 
pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of 
Note 14 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements

We access domestic and international capital markets for 
long-term funding (generally greater than one year) through 
issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and 
asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-term debt in a 
variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient 
funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. 
Proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate 
purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the applicable 
prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the proceeds 

from securities issued in the future will be used for the same 
purposes. Depending on market conditions and our liquidity 
position, we may redeem or repurchase, and subsequently retire, 
our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open 
market transactions, by tender offer, or otherwise. Table 35 
presents a summary of our long-term debt. For additional 
information, including contractual maturities of our long-term 
debt, see Note 12 (Long-Term Debt) to Financial Statements in

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies 
with regard to our credit ratings during fourth quarter 2021. On 

February 16, 2022, Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s) 
affirmed the Company’s ratings and changed the rating outlook 
to stable from negative. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional 
information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact 
a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and 
operations, as well as Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for information regarding additional 
collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative 
instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below 
investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 

as of December 31, 2021, are presented in Table 36.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal Home 
Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that lending 
institutions use to finance housing and economic development in 
local communities. We are a member of the FHLBs based in 
Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. FHLB members are 
required to maintain a minimum investment in capital stock of 
the applicable FHLB. The board of directors of each FHLB can 
increase the minimum investment requirements in the event it 
has concluded that additional capital is required to allow it to 
meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the 
minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges 
requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. 
Because the extent of any obligation to increase our investment 
in any of the FHLBs depends entirely upon the occurrence of a 
future event, the amount of any future investment in the capital 
stock of the FHLBs is not determinable.

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
December 31, 2021, increased $17.6 billion from December 31, 
2020, predominantly as a result of $21.5 billion of Wells Fargo 
net income, partially offset by $3.7 billion of common and 
preferred stock dividends. During 2021, we issued $2.1 billion of 
common stock, substantially all of which was issued in 
connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2021, 
we repurchased 306 million shares of common stock at a cost of 
$14.5 billion. For additional information about capital planning, 
see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section below. 
In 2021, we issued $5.8 billion of preferred stock and 

redeemed $6.7 billion of preferred stock. For additional 
information, see Note 18 (Preferred Stock) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, 
and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both 
approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 37 and 
Table 38 present the risk-based capital requirements applicable 
to the Company on a fully phased-in basis under the 
Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as 
of December 31, 2021. 

Table 37:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized Approach 
as of December 31, 2021 

Table 38:  Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Advanced Approach as of 
December 31, 2021 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 37 and Table 38, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. The FRB did not include a countercyclical buffer in 
the risk-based capital ratio requirements at December 31, 2021. 
The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress.

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, is 
3.10%. 

As a G-SIB, we are also subject to the FRB’s rule 
implementing an additional capital surcharge of between 
1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio requirements of G-
SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge 
under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. 
The first method (method one) considers our size, 
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses 
similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-
term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher 
surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital 
surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in 
future years. Our G-SIB capital surcharge decreased by 50 
basis points to 1.50% beginning in first quarter 2022. 

Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). 

Table 39:  Capital Components and Ratios (Fully Phased-In) 

Effective January 1, 2022, we are required by federal 
banking regulators to use the Standardized Approach for 
Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) for calculating exposure 
amounts for credit RWAs on derivative contracts. SA-CCR 
replaced the current exposure method for calculating these 
exposure amounts for purposes of our risk-based capital ratios 
and our supplementary leverage ratio. The adoption of SA-CCR 
resulted in an increase of less than 1.00% in total RWAs under the 
Standardized Approach (which was our binding approach at 
December 31, 2021) and a decrease of less than 0.50% in total 
leverage exposure at January 1, 2022. 

The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and 

tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the 
requirements for determining tier 2 and total capital remained in 
accordance with transition requirements at December 31, 2021, 
but became fully phased-in beginning January 1, 2022. 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Although we report certain capital amounts and 
ratios in accordance with transition requirements for bank 
regulatory reporting purposes, we manage our capital on a fully 
phased-in basis. For information about our capital requirements 
calculated in accordance with transition requirements, see 
Note 28 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other 
Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 39 summarizes our CET1, tier 1 capital, total capital, 

RWAs and capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis at 
December 31, 2021 and 2020. Fully phased-in total capital 
amounts and ratios are considered non-GAAP financial measures 
that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, 
investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s 
capital position. See Table 40 for information regarding the 
calculation and components of our CET1, tier 1 capital, total 
capital and RWAs, as well as a corresponding reconciliation to 
GAAP financial measures for our fully phased-in total capital 
amounts.

In second quarter 2021, we elected to change our accounting method for low-income housing tax credit investments and elected to change the presentation of investment tax credits related to solar 
energy investments. Prior period total equity was revised to conform with the current period presentation. Prior period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related metrics were not 
revised. 
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period end. 
At December 31, 2021, the impact of the current expected credit losses (CECL) transition provision issued by federal banking regulators on our regulatory capital was an increase in capital of 
$241 million, reflecting a $991 million (post-tax) increase in capital recognized upon our initial adoption of CECL, offset by 25% of the $4.9 billion increase in our ACL under CECL from January 1, 
2020, through December 31, 2021. 
Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of 
qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 
1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs. 
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. 
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity 
securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) 
tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; 
and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), 

which represents our annualized earnings as a percentage of 
tangible common equity. The methodology of determining 
tangible common equity may differ among companies. 
Management believes that tangible book value per common 
share and return on average tangible common equity, which 
utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures 
because they enable management, investors, and others to 
assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 43 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 44 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
December 31, 2021. 

Table 44:  Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company 

In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at 
least 6.00% to be considered well capitalized under applicable 
regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum tier 1 
leverage ratio of 4.00%. 

The FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the SLR 

rules (Proposed SLR rules) that would replace the 2.00% 
supplementary leverage buffer with a buffer equal to one-half of 
our G-SIB capital surcharge. The Proposed SLR rules would 
similarly tailor the current 6.00% SLR requirement for our IDIs.

Adjustment represents derivatives and collateral netting exposures as defined for 
supplementary leverage ratio determination purposes. 
Adjustment represents counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions where 
Wells Fargo & Company is the principal counterparty facing the client. 
Adjustment represents credit equivalent amounts of other off-balance sheet exposures 
not already included as derivatives and repo-style transactions exposures. 
The tier 1 leverage ratio consists of tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required 
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments, as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
December 31, 2021, are presented in Table 46.

leverage buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to one-half 
of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge, and the leverage 
component for calculating the minimum amount of eligible 
unsecured long-term debt would be modified from 4.50% of 
total leverage exposure to 2.50% of total leverage exposure plus 
one-half of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB capital surcharge. Accordingly, 
we currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio that is 100 
basis points above our regulatory requirement plus an 
incremental buffer of 25 to 50 basis points. Our capital targets 
are subject to change based on various factors, including changes 
to the regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned 
capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the

institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various 
factors determine the amount of our share repurchases, 
including our capital requirements, the number of shares we 
expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions, 
market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and 

regulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s 
capital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the 
amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be 
in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations 
under our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various 
price levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any 
time. 

At December 31, 2021, we had remaining Board authority to 

repurchase approximately 361 million shares, subject to 
regulatory and legal conditions. For additional information about 
share repurchases during fourth quarter 2021, see Part II, Item 5 
in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights 
the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight 
initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For 
additional information about the regulatory matters discussed 
below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, 
see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2021 Form 
10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 28 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform 
legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional 
information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its 
rulemaking initiatives. 
• 

Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important 
firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal 
banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and 
regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. 
The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing 
enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based 
capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single 
counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity 
limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave 
threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB 
and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress 
testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In 
addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish 
remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress. Furthermore, in order to promote a BHC’s 
safety and soundness and the financial and operational 
resilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance 
regarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and 
has proposed related guidance identifying core principles for 
effective senior management. The OCC, under separate 
authority, has finalized guidelines establishing heightened 
governance and risk management standards for large 
national banks such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC 
guidelines require covered banks to establish and adhere to a 
written risk governance framework to manage and control 
their risk-taking activities. The guidelines also formalize 
roles and responsibilities for risk management practices 
within covered banks and create certain risk oversight 

• 

• 

responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to 
the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory 
requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-
Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may 
recommend new systemic risk management requirements 
and require new reporting of systemic risks. 
Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank 
Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate 
disclosures regarding financial products and are protected 
from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has 
issued a number of rules impacting consumer financial 
products, including rules regarding the origination, servicing, 
notification, disclosure and other requirements with respect 
to residential mortgage lending, as well as rules impacting 
prepaid cards, credit cards, and other financial products and 
banking-related activities. In addition to these rulemaking 
activities, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing supervisory 
examination activities of the financial services industry with 
respect to a number of consumer businesses and products, 
including mortgage lending and servicing, fair lending 
requirements, and auto finance. 
Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The 
Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for 
regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to 
authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive 
sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, 
respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared 
swaps and security-based swaps. As a provisionally-
registered swap dealer and a conditionally-registered 
security-based swap dealer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is 
subject to these rules. These rules, as well as others adopted 
or under consideration by regulators in the United States 
and other jurisdictions, may negatively impact customer 
demand for over-the-counter derivatives, impact our ability 
to offer customers new derivatives or amendments to 
existing derivatives, and may increase our costs for engaging 
in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives 
activities. 

Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules 
issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-

62 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The 
Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified 
leverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the 
Company is required to have a minimum amount of total loss 
absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. 
Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a 
liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For 
additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage 
and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable 
to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – 
Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. 

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as 
“living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. 
Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a 
reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable 
period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the 
risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the 
financial stability of the United States. In addition to the 
Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare 
and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements 
on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we 
adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any 
deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or 
operations. On June 29, 2021, we submitted our most recent 
resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. 

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 
important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 
default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”), 
then the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver 
and the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s 
orderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a 
company in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are 
exposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the 
rights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to 
disregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an 
administrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to 
determine creditors’ claims. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the 
only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 
FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 

announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an 
orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 
2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended 
and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with 
WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and 
subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo 
Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC 
(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated 
from time to time as material entities for resolution planning 
purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time 
as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related 
Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including 
the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and 
intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its 
subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will 
continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time 
to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, 
the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide 
capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered 
Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support 
Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the 
Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of 
credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected 
to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating 
conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its 
debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other 
obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these 
arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ 
or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s 
board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the 
committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to 
pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which 
could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and 
its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could 
result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the 
Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if 
the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective 
obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, 
the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant 
to a related security agreement. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a 
range of options that we may consider during times of 
idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial 
weaknesses and restore market confidence without 
extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the 
possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan

In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued guidelines for 

banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect 
to waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, and 
providing payment deferrals. Any current or future rules, 
regulations, and guidance related to the COVID-19 
pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain 
of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings, 
impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect 
our business operations and/or competitive position. 
Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change. 
Federal and state governments and government agencies 
have demonstrated increased attention to the impacts and 
potential risks associated with climate change. For example, 
federal banking regulators are reviewing the implications of 
climate change on the financial stability of the United States 
and the identification and management by BHCs of climate-
related financial risks. The approaches taken by various 
governments and government agencies can vary 
significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any 
current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to 
climate change and its impacts could require us to change 
certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and 
earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise 
adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive 
position. 

Regulatory Matters (continued) 

portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and 
periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the 
Bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is 
experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has 
not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution 
is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our 
recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on 
our business or ultimately require us to divest assets. 

Other Regulatory Related Matters 
• 

Regulatory actions.  The Company is subject to a number of 
consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may 
require the Company, among other things, to undertake 
certain changes to its business, operations, products and 
services, and risk management practices, and include the 
following: 
◦ 

Consent Orders Discussed in the “Overview” Section in this 
Report.  For a discussion of certain consent orders 
applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section 
in this Report. 

• 

◦  OCC approval of director and senior executive officer 

appointments and certain post-termination payments. 
Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements 
that were originally imposed in November 2016 to 
provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-
objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in 
directors and senior executive officers, and remains 
subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-
termination payments to certain individuals and 
employees. 

Regulatory Developments Related to COVID-19.  In response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal 
banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help 
stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy, 
and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like 
Wells Fargo to continue lending to consumers and 
businesses. For example, in order to facilitate the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES 
Act), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to 
encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus 
measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s 
Paycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a 
number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity 
and the functioning of markets, including facilities covering 
money market mutual funds and term asset-backed 
securities loans. Certain of these measures, including the 
acceptance of applications under the Paycheck Protection 
Program and the extension of credit under certain FRB 
lending facilities, ended in 2021. Federal banking regulators 
also issued rules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC 
rules and other prudential regulations to temporarily ease 
certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage 
the use of certain FRB-established facilities in order to 
further promote lending to consumers and businesses.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for contingent litigation losses; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an ACL for loans, which is management’s estimate 
of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded 
credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans 
and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held 
for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities 
classified as either HTM or AFS, other financial assets measured 
at amortized cost, net investments in leases, and other off-
balance sheet credit exposures. For additional information, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a 
discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the 
judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the 
initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to 
time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business 
strategy, products or product mix, or debt security investment 
strategy, may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in 
our ACL. While our methodology attributes portions of the ACL 
to specific financial asset classes (loan and debt security 
portfolios) or loan portfolio segments (commercial and 
consumer), the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of 
the Company. 

• 

Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast 
period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to 
estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables 
include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, 
and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic 

variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some 
economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, 
for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for 
unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real 
estate prices. Quarterly, we assess the length of the initial 
loss forecast period and have currently set the period to two 
years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast 
multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base 
scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises 
judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios 
that are used to estimate future credit losses. 
Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term 
average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the 
long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the 
forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages 
are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. 
The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is 
assessed on a quarterly basis. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually 
assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit 
variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower 
quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial 
strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default 
curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted 
collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted 
severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk 
ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers 
and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk 
specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses. 
Management uses a combination of judgment and 
quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation, 
modeling approach, and variables that are leveraged in the 
models. These models are validated in accordance with the 
Company’s policies by an internal model validation group. 
We routinely assess our model performance and apply 
adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss 
estimation. We also assess our models for limitations 
against the company-wide risk inventory to help ensure that 
we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our 
estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as 
needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial 
asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply 
judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental charge-downs and increases 
in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a negative 
allowance when the financial asset has been previously 
written-down below current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We 
extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension

Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

options. We also incorporate any scenarios where we 
reasonably expect to provide an extension through a TDR. 
Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, which 
requires that we determine a contractual life by estimating 
the application of future payments to the outstanding loan 
amount. 

•  Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions 
used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity  The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by 
management. Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based 
on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio 
credit quality, and general economic conditions. General 
economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables, 
which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or 
portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous credit cycles, 
there are observed changes in economic variables such as the 
unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which may not 
move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite 
directions or differ across portfolios or geography. 

Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s 

view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We 
applied 100% weight to the downside scenario in our sensitivity 
analysis to reflect the potential for further economic 
deterioration from a COVID-19 resurgence. The outcome of the 
scenario was influenced by the duration, severity, and timing of 
changes in economic variables within the scenario. The sensitivity 
analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of 
approximately $4.4 billion at December 31, 2021. The 
hypothetical increase in our ACL for loans does not incorporate 
the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors 
applied in the current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or 
negative effect on the results. It is possible that others 
performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different 
conclusions or results. 

The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities 

and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall 
ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for 
loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. 

Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 
(MSRs) 
MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing 
rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we 
originate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from 
third parties. We also have acquired MSRs in the past under co-
issuer agreements that provide for us to service loans that were 
originated and securitized by third-party correspondents. 

We carry our MSRs related to residential mortgage loans 
at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the 
economic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are 
reflected in earnings. 

We use a model to estimate the fair value of our 
residential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with 
Company policies by an internal model validation group. The 
model calculates the present value of estimated future net 
servicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions 
that market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain 

significant inputs and assumptions generally are not 
observable in the market and require judgment to determine. 
If observable market indications do become available, these 
are factored into the estimates as appropriate: 
• 

The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future 
net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate 
at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage 
loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower 
defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and 
borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in 
mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. 
The discount rate used to present value estimated future net 
servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of 
return investors in the market would expect for an asset 
with similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider 
the risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates 
such as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in 
future servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on 
escrow accounts). 
The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net 
servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes 
estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency 
and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of 
defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service 
loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market 
participant's view for our estimated cost to service and our 
actual costs may vary from that estimate. 

• 

• 

Both prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, 

and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and 
mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in 
either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results 
in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in 
either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of 
the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-
driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount 
rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the 
future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in 
servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state 
foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant 
information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an 
impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation 
in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value 
estimate to independent appraisals. 

For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a 
financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value 
adjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair 
value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities 
held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS 
debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are 
carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments, 
such as certain LHFS, a majority of nonmarketable equity 
securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair 
value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value 
adjustments due to application of lower-of-cost-or-market 

66 

Wells Fargo & Company 

  
 
accounting, measurement alternative accounting or write-
downs of individual assets. We also disclose our estimate of fair 
value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as 
loans held for investment or issuances of long-term debt. 

The accounting requirements for fair value measurements 

include a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and 
liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and 
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to 
the valuation methodology used for measurement are 
observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-
derived or market-based information obtained from 
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our 
estimates about market data. 

When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the 

use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to 
measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not 
available, fair value measurement is based upon models that 
generally use market-based or independently sourced market 
parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment 
rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when 
observable market data is limited or not available, fair value 
estimates are typically determined using internal models based 
on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair 
value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an 
internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party 
pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either 
record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal 
prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed 
over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements. 

When using internal models based on unobservable inputs, 

management judgment is necessary as we make judgments 
about significant assumptions that market participants would 
use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions 
includes consideration of many factors, including market 
conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, 
such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in 
secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and 
reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine 
fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available 
quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may 
adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using 
internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact 
of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair 
value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and 
certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs 
have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-
party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model 
uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market 
participant would require in light of the illiquid market. 

We continually assess the level and volume of market 
activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining 
adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions 
can change over time, our determination of which securities 
markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we 
determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted 
prices require adjustment, can also change. 

Significant judgment is also applied in the determination of 

whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this 
judgment, we consider available information, including 
observable market data, indications of market liquidity and 
orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques 
and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The 
classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts 

and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category 
and judgments are made regarding the significance of 
unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are 
considered significant to the fair value measurement, the 
instrument is classified as Level 3.

fair value on a recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities

Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on 
our fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement 
techniques and the impact to our financial statements. 

Income Taxes 
We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we 
operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: 
current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax 
expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded 
for the current period and includes income tax expense related to 
uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that 
management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of 
realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our 
realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet 
method and deferred income tax expense results from changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the 
balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is 
based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and 
tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes 
in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred 
tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment 
that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance 
reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. 

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

are complex and subject to different interpretations by 
management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In 
establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make 
judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax 
laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future 
certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax 
jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review 
during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise 
over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these

disputes during the tax examination and audit process and 
ultimately through the court systems when applicable. 

regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in 
market capitalization. 

We monitor relevant tax authorities and revise our estimate 

We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill 

of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and 
their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities on a 
quarterly basis. Revisions of our estimate of accrued income 
taxes also may result from our own income tax planning and from 
the resolution of income tax controversies. Such revisions in our 
estimates may be material to our operating results for any given 
quarter. 

See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes 
and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

Liability for Contingent Litigation Losses 
The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, 
governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or 
investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its 
business activities, and many of those proceedings and 
investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or 
other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal 
actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For 
such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best 
estimate within a range of potential losses that are both 
probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best 
estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those 
potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may 
be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for 
those actions. 

We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for 

potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing 
the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. 
Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of 
reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for 
probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding 
of information currently available related to the legal evaluation 
and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on 
these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and 
senior management. These matters may be in various stages of 
investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a 
wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and 
jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was 
not considered or was considered remote in anticipated 
occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will 
change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject 

to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to 
determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also 
inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there 
may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably 
possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses 
may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of 
reasonably possible loss. 

See Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for additional information. 

Goodwill Impairment 
We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or 
more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors 
warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-
term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue 
generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by 

impairment at the reportable operating segment level or one 
level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as 
allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible 
assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-
sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital 
requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units 
based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using 
both an income approach and a market approach and are 
intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as 
well as external market conditions. The methodologies for 
calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are 
periodically assessed by senior management and revised as 
necessary. 

The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) 
analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows 
associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires 
significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our lines of 
business. Significant assumptions include future expectations of 
economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and 
assumptions related to future business activities. The forecasts 
are reviewed by senior management. For periods after our 
financial forecasts, we incorporate a terminal value estimate 
based on an assumed long-term growth rate. We discount these 
forecasted cash flows using a rate derived from the capital asset 
pricing model which produces an estimated cost of equity 
specific to that reporting unit, which reflects risks and 
uncertainties in the financial markets and in our internally 
generated business projections. 

The market approach utilizes observable market data from 

comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings 
or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting 
unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a 
control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical 
acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in 
the selection of comparable companies and includes those with 
the most similar business activities. 

The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our 

market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2021 assessment. 
Factors that we considered in our assessment and contributed to 
this difference included: (i) an overall premium that would be paid 
to gain control of the operating and financial decisions of the 
Company, (ii) synergies that we believe may not be reflected in 
the price of the Company’s common stock, (iii) a higher degree of 
complexity and execution risk at the Company level, compared 
with the individual reporting unit level, and (iv) risks or benefits 
at the Company level that may not be reflected in the fair value 
of the individual reporting units. 

Based on our fourth quarter 2021 assessment, there was no 
impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2021. The fair value of 
each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a substantial 
amount. 

Declines in our ability to generate revenue, significant 
increases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions 
from regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill 
impairment in a future period. 

For additional information on goodwill and our reportable 

operating segments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 10 (Intangible Assets), and Note 26 
(Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 49 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 49:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description and Effective Date 

Financial statement impact 

ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): 
Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts and subsequent related updates 
The Update, effective January 1, 2023, 
requires market risk benefits (features 
of insurance contracts that protect the 
policyholder from other-than-nominal 
capital market risk and expose the 
insurer to that risk) to be measured at 
fair value through earnings with 
changes in fair value attributable to 
our own credit risk recognized in other 
comprehensive income. The Update 
also requires more frequent updates 
for insurance assumptions, mandates 
the use of a standardized discount rate 
for traditional long-duration contracts, 
and simplifies the amortization of 
deferred acquisition costs. 

The most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity 
products for a limited number of our insurance clients. Our reinsurance business is no 
longer entering into new contracts. These variable annuity products contain guaranteed 
minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the 
policyholder's life once the account values are exhausted. These guaranteed minimum 
benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair value. 
The cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon 
adoption of the Update, net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our 
own credit risk, will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the 
earliest period presented and will affect our regulatory capital calculations. At 
December 31, 2021, our estimated liability related to these guaranteed minimum 
benefits was approximately $500 million and was associated with approximately 
$13.1 billion of policyholder account values. We expect future earnings volatility from 
changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, which are sensitive to changes in equity 
and fixed income markets, as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality 
assumptions. We plan to economically hedge the market volatility, where feasible. 
Changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long-
duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality 
and performance, including our expectations regarding future 
loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic 
scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or 
targets; (vii) the performance of our mortgage business and any 
related exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global 
economic growth; 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on our 
credit quality and business operations, as well as its impact 
on general economic and financial market conditions; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses,

including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification 
efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands 
that we receive, any negative effects relating to our 
mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure 
practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial 
requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking 
business and any changes in industry standards; 
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairments of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter and from other instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal 
actions, which may result in, among other things, additional 
costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to U.S. tax guidance and regulations, as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in this Report.

requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory 
approval or conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this Report, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company. 

ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND 
LIQUIDITY RISKS 

Our financial results have been, and will continue to be, 
materially affected by general economic conditions, and a 
deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial 
markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other 
businesses and our financial results and condition.  We 
generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the 
loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial 
amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest 
income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and 
commercial lending and banking businesses, including our 
mortgage banking business. These businesses have been, and will 
continue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S. 
economy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. The 
negative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S. 
fiscal, monetary and political matters, including concerns about 
deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have 
impacted and may continue to impact the global economy. 
Moreover, geopolitical matters, including international political 
unrest or disturbances, the United Kingdom’s exit from the 
European Union, as well as continued concerns over commodity 
prices, restrictions on international trade and corresponding 
retaliatory measures, and global economic difficulties, may 
impact the stability of financial markets and the global economy. 
Any impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact 
to the U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the 
global economy or any deterioration in general economic 
conditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above 
matters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or 
weaken the U.S. or global economy, could materially adversely 
affect our financial results and condition. 

A weakening in business or economic conditions, including 
higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as 
higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our borrowers’ 
ability to repay their loans, which can negatively impact our credit 
performance. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices 
fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision 
expense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These 
conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan 
performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for 
those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries 
that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The 
ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may 
deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE 
lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In 
addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it 
more challenging for us to increase our consumer and 
commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy 
borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic 
conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest 
rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our 
retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on 

our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions do not 
continue to improve or if the economy worsens and 
unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease 
in consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand 
for our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall, 
reducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings. 
A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which 

may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our 
investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, 
markets and investment banking businesses. For example, 
because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of 
assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those 
assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market 
prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing 
commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage 
business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively 
affect the performance of products we have provided to 
customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional 
costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial 
markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our trading 
activities and venture capital businesses. Any deterioration in 
global financial markets and economies, including as a result of 
any international political unrest or disturbances, may adversely 
affect the revenues and earnings of our international operations, 
particularly our global financial institution and correspondent 
banking services. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” 
sections in this Report. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business 
and financial results, and the ultimate impact will depend on 
future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be 
predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic 
and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to 
the pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively 
impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, 
affected equity market valuations, created significant volatility 
and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment 
levels. In addition, the pandemic resulted in restrictions and 
closures for many businesses, as well as the institution of social 
distancing, masking, and sheltering in place requirements in 
many states and communities. These impacts have varied over 
time, with changes often occurring suddenly. As a result of the 
pandemic, the demand for our products and services may 
continue to be significantly impacted, which could adversely 
affect our revenue, particularly if we are unable to satisfy changes 
in customer needs and preferences. Furthermore, the pandemic 
could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our 
loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses, 
particularly for industries most directly and adversely affected by 
the pandemic, such as travel and entertainment, and/or if 
businesses remain closed or fail, the impact on the global 
economy worsens, or more customers draw on their lines of 
credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. 
In addition, our business operations may be further disrupted if 
significant portions of our workforce are unable to work 
effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government 
actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. 

72 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
 
Moreover, the pandemic has created additional operational 

and compliance risks, including the need to quickly implement 
and execute new programs and procedures for the products and 
services we offer our customers, provide enhanced safety 
measures for our employees and customers, comply with rapidly 
changing regulatory requirements, address any increased risk of 
fraudulent activity, and protect the integrity and functionality of 
our systems, networks and operations while a larger number of 
our employees and those of our third-party service providers 
work remotely. The pandemic could also result in or contribute to 
additional downgrades to our credit ratings or credit outlook. In 
response to the pandemic, we previously suspended certain 
mortgage foreclosure activities and provided fee waivers, 
payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for certain 
consumer and commercial lending customers, and future 
governmental actions may again require these and other types of 
customer-related responses. Our participation in governmental 
measures taken to address the economic impact from the 
COVID-19 pandemic could result in reputational harm, as well as 
continue to result in litigation and government investigations 
and proceedings. In addition, we reduced our common stock 
dividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases, and we 
could take, or be required to take, other capital actions in the 
future. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of 
increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of the other risks 
described herein, including credit, market and operational related 
risks, particularly if the pandemic continues to adversely affect 
the global economy. The extent to which the COVID-19 
pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and 
financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity 
ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly 
uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and 
duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness, availability and use 
of vaccines, the emergence and impact of COVID-19 variants, 
and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third 
parties in response to the pandemic. 

Changes in interest rates and financial market values could 
reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our 
other comprehensive income, including as a result of 
recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we 
hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Changes in 
either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning 
assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the 
February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net 
interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can 
affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our 
assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction 
in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster 
than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or 
contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on 
our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than 
our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract. 

The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect 
our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the 
form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. 
As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower 
demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield 
and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and 
net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged 
low interest rate environment as it may result in us holding lower 
yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, 
particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher 
yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in 
interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and 

could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more 
difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below, 
changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business, 
including the value of our MSRs. 

Changes in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread 

between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also 
reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. 
Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term 
rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve 
flattens, or even inverts, our net interest income and net interest 
margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding 
increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term 
assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which 
interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest 
income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the 
interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while 
also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the 
FRB. 

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on 

our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on 
assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may 
hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate 
derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our 
mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as 
their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based 
on changes in interest rates. 

We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There 
is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or 
option volatility could reduce our net interest income and 
earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material 
amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially 
different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates 
rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve 
changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we 
hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may 
rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and 
loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We 
may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes 
in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could 
limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. 

Because of changing economic and market conditions, as 
well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of 
any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other-
than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the 
securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securities 
we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer 
creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is 
exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection 
with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to 
accommodate the investment and risk management activities of 
our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities and 
equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value with 
realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest 
income. As part of our business to support our customers, we 
trade public debt and equity securities that are subject to market 
fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income. In 
addition, although high market volatility can increase our 
exposure to trading-related losses, periods of low volatility may 
have an adverse effect on our businesses as a result of reduced 
customer activity levels. Although we have processes in place to 
measure and monitor the risks associated with our trading 
activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there

can be no assurance that our processes and strategies will be 
effective in avoiding losses that could have a material adverse 
effect on our financial results. 

The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity 
securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable 
equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and 
losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are 
carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement 
alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized 
gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity 
securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may 
have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. 
When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of 
factors, including general economic and market conditions, the 
prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company 
goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, 
and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. 

Nonmarketable equity securities include our private equity 
and venture capital investments that could result in significant 
OTTI losses for those investments carried under the 
measurement alternative or equity method. If we determine 
there is OTTI for an investment, we write-down the carrying 
value of the investment, resulting in a charge to earnings, which 
could be significant. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk”, “– Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk”, “– Market Risk – Trading 
Activities”, and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the 
“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2 
(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 6 (Equity Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

The transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate 
(LIBOR) may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  The administrator of LIBOR 
ceased publication of LIBOR settings on a representative basis on 
December 31, 2021, with the exception of the most commonly 
used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, which will no longer be 
published on a representative basis after June 30, 2023. 
Additionally, federal banking regulators have issued guidance 
strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD 
LIBOR in new contracts. We have a significant number of assets 
and liabilities, such as commercial loans, adjustable-rate 
mortgage loans, derivatives, debt securities, and long-term debt, 
referenced to LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. When 
any such benchmark rate or other referenced financial metric is 
significantly changed, replaced or discontinued, or ceases to be 
recognized as an acceptable market benchmark rate or financial 
metric, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation 
of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on 
the terms of the governing instrument. 

This could impact the financial performance of previously 
booked transactions, result in losses on financial instruments we 
hold, require different hedging strategies or result in ineffective 
or increased basis risk on existing hedges, impact the overall 
interest rate environment and the availability or cost of floating-
rate funding, affect our capital and liquidity planning and 
management, or have other adverse financial consequences. 
There can be no assurance that any new benchmark rate or other 
financial metric will be an adequate alternative to LIBOR or 
produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR. In addition, the 
transition away from LIBOR will continue to require changes to 
existing transaction data, products, systems, models, operations, 

and pricing processes, as well as the modification or 
renegotiation of a substantial volume of existing transactions 
that reference USD LIBOR. It may also continue to result in 
significant operational, systems, or other practical challenges, 
increased compliance and operational costs, and heightened 
expectations and scrutiny from regulators, and could result in 
litigation, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. 
There can be no assurance that statutory or contractual 
“fallback” provisions will be effective or that we or other 
contracting parties will be able to modify or renegotiate existing 
transactions before the discontinuation of LIBOR. Furthermore, 
the transition away from widely used benchmark rates like LIBOR 
could result in customers or other market participants 
challenging the determination of their interest payments, 
disputing the interpretation or implementation of fallback 
provisions and other transition related changes, or entering into 
fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs, which 
could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business. 
Moreover, to the extent borrowers with loans referenced to 
LIBOR, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, experience 
higher interest payments as a result of the transition to a new 
benchmark rate, our customers’ ability to repay their loans may 
be adversely affected, which can negatively impact our credit 
performance. 

For additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR 
and the steps we are taking to address and mitigate the risks we 
have identified, see the “Overview – Recent Developments – 
LIBOR Transition” section in this Report. 

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation 
of our business, and our financial results and condition could be 
materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage 
our liquidity.  We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a 
low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and 
the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, 
our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, 
our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to 
pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the 
FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and 
international money through capital markets. 

Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or our 
inability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Market 
disruption and volatility could impact our credit spreads, which 
are the amount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury 
securities, or other benchmark securities, of the same maturity 
that we need to pay to our funding providers. Increases in 
interest rates and our credit spreads could significantly increase 
our funding costs. Other conditions and factors that could 
materially adversely affect our liquidity and funding include a lack 
of market or customer confidence in the Company or negative 
news about the Company or the financial services industry 
generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or 
negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets; our 
inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; disruptions or 
volatility in the repurchase market which also may increase our 
short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or 
restrictions; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws on 
lines of credit; and, as described below, reductions in one or more 
of our credit ratings. Many of the above conditions and factors 

74 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
  
may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. 
There can be no assurance that significant disruption and 
volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. For 
example, concerns over geopolitical issues, commodity and 
currency prices, as well as global economic conditions, may cause 
financial market volatility. 

In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels 
and any associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings 
may cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the 
sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt 
ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as 
well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing 
economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely 
affect the market value of the U.S. government securities that 
we hold, the availability of those securities as collateral for 
borrowing, and our ability to access capital markets on favorable 
terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the 
operation of our business and our financial results and condition. 
As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our 
funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial 
services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the 
rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either 
because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we 
lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of 
funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms 
of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive 
alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a 
better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of 
bank deposits and into other investments, we may lose a 
relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs 
and negatively affecting our liquidity. In addition, actions taken 
to manage under the asset cap may continue to impact our 
ability to retain deposits. 

If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through 
customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms 
or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail 
to manage our liquidity effectively (including on an intra-day or 
intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest margin, financial 
results and condition may be materially adversely affected. As we 
did during the financial crisis, we may also need, or be required by 
our regulators, to raise additional capital through the issuance of 
common stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate our common stock 
dividend to preserve capital or to raise additional capital. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. 

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material 
adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, financial results and 
condition.  Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding are 
influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of our 
credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds 
and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and could 
cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral 
requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect 
our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit ratings 
agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ analysis of 
many quantitative and qualitative factors, such as our capital 
adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and 
quality of our earnings, rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support, 
and other rating agency specific criteria. In addition to credit 
ratings, our borrowing costs are affected by various other 
external factors, including market volatility and concerns or 
perceptions about the financial services industry generally. There 

can be no assurance that we will maintain our credit ratings and 
outlooks and that credit ratings downgrades in the future would 
not materially affect our ability to borrow funds and borrowing 
costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger 
additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on 
the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse 
effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related 
contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. 
For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk 

Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and 
Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall 
below investment grade, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and 
federal and state law, as well as certain contractual 
arrangements, can limit those dividends.  Wells Fargo & 
Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is a 
separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives 
substantially all of its funding and liquidity from dividends and 
other distributions from its subsidiaries. We generally use these 
dividends and distributions, among other things, to pay dividends 
on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on 
our debt. Federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends 
and distributions that our bank and some of our nonbank 
subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, may pay to 
the Parent. In addition, under a Support Agreement dated 
June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, 
among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo 
Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the 
Parent designated from time to time as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as 
related support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be 
restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if 
certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers 
or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to participate in a 
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or 
reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s 
creditors. 

For additional information, see the “Regulation and 
Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company 
Structure” sections in our 2021 Form 10-K and to Note 28 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

REGULATORY RISKS 

Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require 
us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our 
revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or 
otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or 
competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary 
banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those 
related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and 
extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as 
well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of 
the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations 
generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, 
consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial 
system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. 

Wells Fargo & Company 

75 

 
  
 
Risk Factors (continued) 

Economic, market and political conditions during the past few 
years have led to a significant amount of legislation and 
regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services 
industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of 
financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws 
and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we 
do business and the products and services that we provide, affect 
or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our 
ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our 
revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, 
increase our capital requirements, impose additional fees, 
assessments or taxes on us, intensify the regulatory supervision 
of us and the financial services industry, and adversely affect our 
business operations or have other negative consequences. Our 
businesses and revenues in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject 
to risks from political, economic and social developments in 
those jurisdictions, including sanctions or business restrictions, 
asset freezes or confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic 
developments, or financial or social instability. In addition, 
greater government oversight and scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as 
well as financial services companies generally, has increased our 
operational and compliance costs as we must continue to devote 
substantial resources to enhancing our procedures and controls 
and meeting heightened regulatory standards and expectations. 
Any failure to meet regulatory requirements, standards or 
expectations, either in the U.S. or in non-U.S. jurisdictions, could 
continue to result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our 
ability to engage in certain business activities, or other adverse 
consequences. 

Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, 

credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending 
businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly 
complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as 
enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory 
examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s 
rules may continue to increase our compliance costs and require 
changes in our business practices, which could limit or negatively 
affect the products and services that we offer our customers. If 
we fail to meet enhanced regulatory requirements and 
expectations with respect to our consumer businesses, we may 
be subject to increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our 
business activities including the products and services we can 
provide, and/or harm to our reputation. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a 

comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter 
derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based 
swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to 
negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter 
derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives 
or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for 
engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives 
activities. 

We are also subject to various rules and regulations related 
to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, 
including the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001. These rules and 
regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies 
and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery 
and corruption, fraud, compliance, suspicious activities, currency 
transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. Although 
we have policies and procedures designed to comply with these 
rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully effective or 
do not meet heightened regulatory standards or expectations, 
we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain 
activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. 

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations 
enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental 
authorities relating to the privacy of the information of 
customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, 
among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a 
significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, 
sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data 
breaches; and provide for significantly increased penalties for 
non-compliance. 

In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders 
and other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent 
order with the FRB regarding the Board’s governance and 
oversight of the Company, and the Company’s compliance and 
operational risk management program. This consent order limits 
the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the 
consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain 
conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely 
affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also 
subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate 
lock extensions. Similarly, we are subject to a September 2021 
consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in 
the Company’s Home Lending business. 

Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank 
remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in 
November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain 
non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors 
and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain 
regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain 
individuals and employees. 

The Company may be subject to further actions, including 

the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory 
agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators 
regarding similar or other issues. Furthermore, issues or delays in 
satisfying the requirements of a regulatory action could affect 
our progress on others, and failure to satisfy the requirements of 
a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional 
penalties, enforcement actions, and other negative 
consequences, which could be significant. For example, in 
September 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money 
penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in 
addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent 
order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home 
Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB 
consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the 
September 2021 OCC consent order, and any other consent 
orders or regulatory actions, as well as the implementation of 
their requirements, may continue to increase the Company’s 
costs, require the Company to reallocate resources away from 
growing its existing businesses, subject the Company to business 
restrictions, negatively impact the Company’s capital and 
liquidity, and require the Company to undergo significant 
changes to its business, operations, products and services, and 
risk management practices. For additional information on the 
Company’s consent orders, see the “Overview” section in this 
Report. 

Other future regulatory initiatives that could significantly 

affect our business include proposals to reform the housing 
finance market in the United States. These proposals, among 
other things, consider ending the conservatorships of the GSEs 
and reducing or eliminating over time the role of the GSEs in 
buying mortgage loans or guaranteeing mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS), as well as the implementation of reforms 

76 

Wells Fargo & Company 

relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage 
market. The extent and timing of any regulatory reform or the 
adoption of any legislation regarding the GSEs and/or the home 
mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company’s 
business and financial results, are uncertain. 

Any other future legislation and/or regulation, if adopted, 
also could significantly change our regulatory environment and 
increase our cost of doing business, limit the activities we may 
pursue or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings 
associations, credit unions, and other financial services 
companies, and have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results and condition. 

For additional information on the significant regulations and 
regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect 
our business, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report 
and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2021 Form 
10-K. 

We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities 
or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or 
recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB 
and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits 
resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate 
our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial 
distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or 
FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. If 
the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has 
deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or 
operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the 
FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable 
to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain 
assets or operations. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a 
range of options that we may consider during times of 
idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial 
weaknesses and restore market confidence without 
extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare 
and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the 
FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, 
they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately 
require us to divest assets. 

Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of 
Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. 
If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the 
FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires 
that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses 
before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are 
substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the 
orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of 
creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain 
circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure 
instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the 
only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we 
entered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC 
and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. 
In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC 
will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital 
and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect 
subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the 
IHC will provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through 
subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain 
liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if 
the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be 
forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the 
IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, 
any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s 
liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, 
and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy 
proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have 
otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not 
implemented. 

Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on 
shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the 
Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. 
Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive 
significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s 
security holders could face significant or complete losses. This 
outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly 
liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted 
using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of 
entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its 
subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution 
proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple 
point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries 
could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s 
security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved 
to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses 
than if the strategy had not been implemented. 

For additional information, see the “Regulatory Matters – 
‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this 
Report. 

Bank regulations and rules may require higher capital and 
liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock 
dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our 
business, or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository 
institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In 
particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal 
banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital 
requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, 
among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating 
capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal 
banking regulators have also finalized rules to impose a leverage 
ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like 
Wells Fargo and our insured depository institutions. The FRB has 
also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and 
unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its 
resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss 
absorbing capacity (TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators 
have issued final rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio 
and a net stable funding ratio. 

Wells Fargo & Company 

77 

  
Risk Factors (continued) 

In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced 
capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms 
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital 
plan rule that establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations 
implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs 
like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk 
and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and 
imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators 
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the 
United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules 
implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and 
national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to 
establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing 
financial distress and has proposed additional requirements 
regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs, 
including its expectations for boards of directors and senior 
management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also 
established heightened governance and risk management 
standards for large national banks, such as the Bank. 

The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, 

liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may 
limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including 
common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require 
us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that 
we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or 
liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, 
such as to the Basel standards, or as a result of business growth, 
acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to 
liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product 
offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect 
our financial results. Although not currently anticipated, 
proposed capital requirements and/or our regulators may require 
us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional 
common stock may dilute the ownership of existing 
stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may 
continue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our 
ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products 
and services to our customers. 

For additional information, see the “Capital Management,” 
“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk 
and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” 
sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” 
section in our 2021 Form 10-K. 

FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can 
significantly affect business and economic conditions and our 
financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of 
money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part 
our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we 
earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our 
net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest 
rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial 
instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In 
addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially 
increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. 
Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal 
funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its 
balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict. 
As noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and 
a flattening yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions 
could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest 

margin, as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and 
debt securities on our consolidated balance sheet. 

CREDIT RISKS 

Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in 
economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could 
require us to increase our provision for credit losses and 
allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit 
risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. 
As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance 
of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results 
and condition. As noted above, if the current economic 
environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may 
have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which 
could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for 
credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an 
allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this 
allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in 
our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The 
process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to 
our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective 
and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of 
economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of 
our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the 
allowance because of changing economic conditions, including 
falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant 
loan growth, changes in consumer behavior or other market 
conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors. 
Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such 
as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social 
matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit 
losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit 
losses. 

Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses 
was appropriate at December 31, 2021, there is no assurance 
that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if 
housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of 
significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we 
experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build 
reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings. 
For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. 

We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the 
extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry 
segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or 
collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our 
loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or 
similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group 
may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 
market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market 
conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or 
geography may also impact related or dependent industries or 
the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in 
such industries to meet their financial obligations. We 
experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 
when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential 
real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater 

78 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
 
 
 
  
than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in 
many markets, including the Central Valley California market and 
several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As 
California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and 
deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying 
economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California 
could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes 
in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely 
affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may 
increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these 
borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration 
in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could 
result in materially higher credit losses, including for our 
residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes 
nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. 
We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as 
our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their 
contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. 

We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. 
A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects 
the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including 
increases in interest rates, declines in commercial property 
values, and/or changes in consumer behavior or other market 
conditions, such as a continued decrease in the demand for office 
space, could result in materially higher credit losses and have a 
material adverse effect on our financial results and condition. 

Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions 

may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material 
adverse effect on our credit performance and results of 
operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively 
affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. 
operations. 

Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain 

derivative transactions through central counterparty 
clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these 
CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we 
may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the 
CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults 
on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-
performance by our clients for which we clear transactions 
through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not 
sufficiently covered by available collateral. 

For additional information regarding credit risk, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section and 
Note 4 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC AND LEGAL RISKS 

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, 
controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors 
and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, 
damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. 
As a large financial institution that serves customers through 
numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking 
and other distribution channels across the U.S. and 
internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and 
monitor a large number of customer transactions on a 
continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have 
expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have 
increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide 
products and services to our customers, as customer, public, 
legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and 
information security have increased, and as cyber and other 

information security attacks have become more prevalent and 
complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure 
must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential 
failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, 
accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems 
and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient 
based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or 
damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that 
are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there 
have been and could in the future be sudden increases in 
customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications 
outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile 
banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from 
local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist 
acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information 
security breaches. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to 
our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, 
entail significant costs, and create risks associated with 
implementing new systems and integrating them with existing 
ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our 
systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and 
operating systems, including their security measures and 
controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and 
security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover 
critical business processes or operations that have been 
disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and 
consequences of such disruptions. Although we have business 
continuity plans and other safeguards in place to help provide 
operational resiliency, our business operations may be adversely 
affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical 
infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses 
and customers. For example, on February 7, 2019, we 
experienced system issues caused by an automatic power 
shutdown at one of our main data center facilities. Although 
applications and related workloads were systematically re-routed 
to back-up data centers throughout the day, certain of our 
services, including our online and mobile banking systems, 
certain mortgage origination systems, and certain ATM 
functions, experienced disruptions that delayed service to our 
customers. 

As a result of financial institutions and technology systems 

becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational 
incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material 
impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, 
third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as 
exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors 
that provide services or security solutions for our operations, 
could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including 
from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or 
failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies 
in the performance of their responsibilities. We are also exposed 
to the risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a 
common service provider to those third parties could impede 
their ability to provide services or perform their responsibilities 
for us. In addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and 
expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, 
and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their 
obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, 
regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, 
restrictions on our business, or other negative consequences. 

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls 

or operating systems that support our businesses and 
customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to 

Wells Fargo & Company 

79 

 
Risk Factors (continued) 

adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform 
their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or 
oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business 
disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance and other costs, violations of applicable 
privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse 
consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition. 

A cyber attack or other information security breach could have 
a material adverse effect on our results of operations or 
financial condition.  Information security risks for large financial 
institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally increased in 
recent years in part because of the proliferation of new 
technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and cloud 
technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased 
sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, 
terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign 
state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to 
attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to 
commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or 
attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other 
users of our systems to disclose confidential information in order 
to gain access to our data or that of our customers. As noted 
above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission 
and storage of confidential information in our computer systems 
and networks. Our banking, brokerage, investment advisory, and 
capital markets businesses rely on our digital technologies, 
computer and email systems, software, hardware, and networks 
to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products 
and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, 
tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control 
systems. Our technologies, systems, software, networks, and our 
customers’ devices are likely to continue to be the target of 
cyber attacks or other information security breaches, which could 
materially adversely affect us, including as a result of fraudulent 
activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, 
loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ 
confidential, proprietary and other information, or the disruption 
of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third parties’ business 
operations. For example, various retailers have reported they 
were victims of cyber attacks in which large amounts of their 
customers’ data, including debit and credit card information, was 
obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace 
compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity 
affecting our customers. We are also exposed to the risk that an 
employee or other person acting on behalf of the Company fails 
to comply with applicable policies and procedures and 
inappropriately circumvents controls for personal gain or other 
improper purposes. 

Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of 

financial institutions and technology systems, an information 
security incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or 
material impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. In 
addition, third parties on which we rely, including those that 
facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource 
operations, such as internet, mobile technology, hardware, 
software, and cloud service providers, could continue to be 
sources of information security risk to us. If those third parties 
fail to adequately or appropriately safeguard their technologies, 
systems, networks, hardware, and software, we may suffer 
material harm, including business disruptions, losses or 
remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, or other adverse consequences. 

Our risk and exposure to cyber attacks or other information 
security breaches remains heightened because of, among other 
things, the persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the 
prominent size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the 
financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement 
our digital and mobile banking channel strategies and develop 
additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers 
when and how they want to be served, our geographic footprint 
and international presence, the outsourcing of some of our 
business operations, and the current global economic and 
political environment. For example, Wells Fargo and other 
financial institutions, as well as their third-party service 
providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and 
adaptive cyber attacks, including malware, ransomware, other 
malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software 
vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed 
denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of 
financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit 
fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. 
Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications 
and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and 
other products and services provided by third parties, and have 
targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the 
widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website 
performance. As a result, information security and the continued 
development and enhancement of our controls, processes and 
systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software 
and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a 
priority for Wells Fargo. We are also proactively involved in 
industry cybersecurity efforts and working with other parties, 
including our third-party service providers and governmental 
agencies, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency 
to cybersecurity and other information security threats. As these 
threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required 
to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our 
protective measures or to investigate and remediate any 
information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the 
investigation of any information security breach is inherently 
unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not 
be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach, 
which may further increase any associated costs and 
consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers 
aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be 
sufficient to cover all losses associated with an information 
security breach. 

Cyber attacks or other information security breaches 

affecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that 
facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource 
operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or 
devices that our customers use to access our products and 
services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or 
customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance, 
remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and 
other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences, 
any of which could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations or financial condition. 

Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in 
mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework 
seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established 
processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, 
monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are 
subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest 
rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 

80 

Wells Fargo & Company 

management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, 
identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also 
dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and a 
sound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to 
develop effective operational controls or to foster the 
appropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the 
inability to align performance management and compensation to 
achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we 
are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we 
may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We 
process a large number of transactions each day and are exposed 
to risks if we do not accurately or completely execute a process 
or transaction, whether due to human error or otherwise, or if an 
employee fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, 
inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other 
misconduct. In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, 
monitor and predict risks, such as market, interest rate and credit 
risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there 
is no assurance that these models will appropriately or 
sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future 
events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are 
subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, 
penalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business 
activities, or other adverse consequences, and any required 
modifications or changes to these models can impact our capital 
ratios and requirements and result in increased operational and 
compliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and 
assess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any 
issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our 
aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could 
result in ineffective risk management practices, business 
decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or 
inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. We also use 
artificial intelligence to help further inform or automate our 
business decisions and risk management practices, but there is 
no assurance that artificial intelligence will appropriately or 
sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict 
future events or exposures. Previous financial and credit crises 
and resulting regulatory reforms highlighted both the 
importance and some of the limitations of managing 
unanticipated risks, and our regulators remain focused on 
ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells Fargo in particular, 
build and maintain robust risk management policies and 
practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, 
we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory 
proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to 
retail sales practices and other instances where customers may 
have experienced financial harm.  Various government entities 
and offices have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or 
investigations arising out of certain retail sales practices of the 
Company that were the subject of settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney 
announced by the Company on September 8, 2016, and various 
non-governmental parties filed lawsuits against us seeking 
damages or other remedies related to these retail sales practices. 
The Company has entered into various settlements to resolve 
these investigations and proceedings, as a result of which we 
have incurred monetary penalties, costs, and business 

restrictions. If we are unable to meet any ongoing obligations 
under these settlements, we may incur additional monetary or 
other penalties or be required to make admissions of wrongdoing 
and comply with other conditions, which can lead to restrictions 
on our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer 
certain products or services, limitations on our ability to access 
capital markets, limitations on capital distributions, the loss of 
customers, and/or other adverse consequences. Any inability to 
meet our ongoing obligations under these settlements, 
depending on the sanctions and remedy sought and granted, 
could materially adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. Furthermore, negative publicity or public 
opinion resulting from these matters may increase the risk of 
reputational harm to our business, which can impact our ability to 
keep and attract customers, affect our ability to attract and 
retain qualified employees, result in the loss of revenue, or have 
other material adverse effects on our results of operations and 
financial condition. 

Furthermore, we have and may in the future identify other 

areas or instances where customers may have experienced 
financial harm, including as a result of our continuing efforts to 
rebuild trust and to strengthen our risk and control 
infrastructure. For example, we have identified certain issues 
related to past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain issues related to the 
unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection waiver or 
insurance agreements. The identification of such other areas or 
instances where customers may have experienced financial harm 
could lead to, and in some cases has already resulted in, 
additional remediation costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal 
or regulatory proceedings, compliance and other costs, 
reputational damage, or other adverse consequences. 

For additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales 
Practices Matters and Other Customer Remediation Activities” 
section and Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

We may incur fines, penalties and other negative 
consequences from regulatory violations or from any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We maintain 
systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with 
applicable laws and regulations. However, we are subject to 
heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and 
expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly 
complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject 
to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to 
various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or 
issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations 
and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in 
the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental 
entities in different jurisdictions. Similarly, regulators may be 
more likely to pursue investigations or proceedings against us to 
the extent that we are or have previously been subject to other 
regulatory actions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions 
in which we operate may be different or even conflict with each 
other, such as differences between U.S. federal and state law or 
differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to the products 
and services we may offer or other business activities we may 
engage in, which can lead to compliance difficulties or issues. 
Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require us to 
report transactions and other information to regulators and 
other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, 
exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to 
fines, penalties, restrictions on our business, or other negative 
consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately 

Wells Fargo & Company

Risk Factors (continued) 

provide regulatory reports, customer notices or disclosures. 
Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the 
imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though 
the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even 
though there were systems and procedures in place at the time 
designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to 
regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in 
the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain 
non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. 
OFAC may impose penalties or restrictions on certain activities 
for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable 
processes are in place to prevent the violations. Any violation of 
these or other applicable laws or regulatory requirements, even if 
inadvertent or unintentional, or any failure to meet regulatory 
standards or expectations, including any failure to satisfy the 
conditions of any consent orders or other regulatory actions, 
could result in significant fees, penalties, restrictions on our 
ability to engage in certain business activities, reputational harm, 
loss of customers or other negative consequences. 

Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged 
conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry 
generally, could adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk 
to our business, earnings and capital from negative public 
opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased 
substantially because of our size and profile in the financial 
services industry and sales practices related matters and other 
instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. 
Negative public opinion about the financial services industry 
generally or Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our 
reputation and our ability to keep and attract customers. 
Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged 
conduct in any number of activities, including sales practices; 
mortgage, auto or other consumer lending practices; loan 
origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; 
management of client accounts or investments; lending, 
investing or other business relationships; identification and 
management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions, 
obligations and interests with and among our customers; 
environmental, social and governance practices; regulatory 
compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; 
and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use 
of customer information, and from actions taken by government 
regulators and community or other organizations in response to 
that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place 
intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-
party service providers that could potentially harm customers or 
our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and 
procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. 
Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or 
prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our 
business or operations could result in significant reputational 
harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses 
under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one 
business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, 
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain 
members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect 
our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized 
by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use 
of social media by our employees and others, including personal 
blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that 
negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be 
posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or 

have other negative consequences, including as a result of our 
employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized 
manner in various social media outlets. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been 
targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, 
which have included disrupting the operation of our retail 
banking locations, and have been subject to negative public 
commentary, including with respect to the fees charged for 
various products and services. Wells Fargo and other financial 
institutions have also been subject to negative publicity as a 
result of providing financial services to or making investments in 
industries or organizations subject to stakeholder concerns. 
There can be no assurance that continued protests or negative 
public opinion of the Company specifically or large financial 
institutions generally will not harm our reputation and adversely 
affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

If we are unable to develop and execute effective business 
plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our 
competitive standing and results of operations could suffer.  In 
order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business 
plans or strategies related to, among other things, our 
organizational structure, our compliance and risk management 
framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products 
and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the 
geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve 
our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do 
business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we 
offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business 
plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require 
significant financial, technological, management and other 
resources, may divert management attention and resources away 
from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses 
and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any 
business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency 
initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are 
unable to develop or execute effective business plans or 
strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive 
position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of 
operations may be adversely affected. 

In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest 
certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture 
may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other 
benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than 
expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain 
customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses 
or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other 
long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets. 

Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our 
products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of 
companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We 
generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we 
can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other 
financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or 
on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals 
will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches 
and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a 
condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to 
be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 
common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may 
cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, 

82 

Wells Fargo & Company 

increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected 
benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in 
higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an 
increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our 
business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability 
to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated 
benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on 
integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing 
businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the 
acquired company or business operates internationally or in a 
geographic location where we do not already have significant 
business operations and/or employees. 

investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition 
to imposing potentially significant monetary penalties, business 
restrictions, and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may 
require criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and 
compliance with other conditions in connection with settling 
such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of 
customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, 
limitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or services, 
and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects.

Financial Statements in this Report. 

Our operations and business could be adversely affected by the 
impacts of climate change.  The physical effects of climate 
change, including the increased prevalence and severity of 
extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as 
hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere 
with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, 
which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause 
losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively 
affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the 
credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the 
deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, 
changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on 
account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a 
low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain 
industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and 
reduce the demand by these customers for our products and 
services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy 
could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or 
other adverse consequences to our business operations. 
Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change, 
as well as stakeholder perceptions regarding climate change, 
could also require us to change certain of our business and/or risk 
management practices, impose additional costs on us, or 
otherwise adversely affect our business. Moreover, our 
reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to 
climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon 
economy, including if we are unable to achieve our objectives or if 
our response is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. For 
additional information on regulatory developments in response 
to climate change, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this 
Report. 

We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences from legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its 
subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, 
arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning 
matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and 
many of those proceedings and investigations expose 
Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate 
outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for 
legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We 
may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not 
established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a 
legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts 
accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal 
proceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought 
and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of 
operations and financial condition. 

As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory 

oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory 

MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS 

Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to 
quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, 
and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to 
reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new 
mortgage loans.  We are one of the largest mortgage originators 
and residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn 
revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and 
for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect 
prepayment assumptions and thus the fair value of our MSRs. 
When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to 
prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate. 
As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our 
MSRs can decrease. Changes in interest rates can also negatively 
affect the fair value of certain residential mortgage loans within 
LHFS and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales 
and securitizations. For example, similar to other interest-
bearing securities, if market interest rates increase relative to the 
yield on these residential mortgage LHFS and other interests, 
their fair value may fall. 

When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually 

tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan 
originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs 
can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, 
mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of 
our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting 
revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,” 
the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, 
the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value 
of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting 
revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to 
the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible 
that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or 
deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall 
or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase 
in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the 
decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates. 

We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of 
our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. 
Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant 
losses from our hedging activities. 

We rely on the GSEs to guarantee or purchase mortgage 

loans that meet their conforming loan requirements and on 
government insuring agencies, such as the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA), to insure or guarantee loans that meet their policy 
requirements. In order to meet customer needs, we also 
originate loans that do not conform to either the GSEs or 
government insuring agency standards, which are referred to as 
“nonconforming” loans. We generally retain these

Risk Factors (continued) 

nonconforming loans on our balance sheet. When we retain a 
loan on our balance sheet not only do we keep the credit risk of 
the loan but we also do not receive any sale proceeds that could 
be used to generate new loans. If we were unable or unwilling to 
retain nonconforming loans on our balance sheet, whether due to 
regulatory, business or other reasons, our ability to originate new 
nonconforming loans may be reduced, thereby reducing the 
interest income we could earn from these loans. Similarly, if the 
GSEs or government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce 
their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to 
fund, and thus originate new mortgage loans, could also be 
reduced. We cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring 
agencies will not materially limit their purchases, insuring or 
guaranteeing of conforming loans or change their criteria for 
what constitutes a conforming loan (e.g., maximum loan amount 
or borrower eligibility). As noted above, there are various 
proposals to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., 
including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The 
impact of any such regulatory reform regarding the housing 
finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the 
Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of 
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” 
sections in this Report. 

We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse 
consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect 
to the residential mortgage loans we originate or service.  In 
order to reduce credit risk and obtain additional funding, from 
time to time we may securitize or sell mortgage loans that we 
originate. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or 
indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or 
insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach 
of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements 
under which we sell mortgage loans that we originate or in the 
insurance or guaranty agreements that we enter into with the 
FHA and VA. We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that 
reflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we 
have a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan 
repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor 
demand strategies and other external conditions that may 
change over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the 
liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to 
estimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is 
subject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market 
worsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and 
increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant 
additions to the repurchase liability. 

Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we 
originate, we could become subject to monetary damages and 
other civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual 
payments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the 
loans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or 
determined that the loans were not originated in accordance with 
applicable laws or regulations. 

Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for 

the mortgage loans we service, we may face a number of 
consequences, including termination as servicer or master 
servicer, requirements to indemnify the securitization trustee 
against losses from any failure by us to perform our servicing 
obligations, and/or contractual obligations to repurchase a 

mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of 
which could significantly reduce our net servicing income. 
We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers, title 
insurers and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or 
other adverse consequences if we fail to meet our servicing 
obligations, including with respect to mortgage foreclosure 
actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our 
net servicing income and the fair value of our MSRs may be 
negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase 
because of higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs. In 
addition, we may continue to be subject to fines, business 
restrictions, and other sanctions imposed by federal or state 
regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our 
mortgage servicing practices, including with respect to our 
foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation activities such as loan 
modifications or forbearances, or our servicing of flood zone 
properties. Any of these actions may harm our reputation, 
negatively affect our residential mortgage origination or 
servicing business, or result in material fines, penalties, equitable 
remedies, or other enforcement actions.

COMPETITIVE RISKS 

We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly 
evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other 
financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is 
undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory 
reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and 
current economic conditions. Our success depends on, among 
other things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and 
enduring relationships with our customers based on the quality 
of our customer service, the wide variety of products and 
services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those 
products and services to satisfy our customers’ needs and 
preferences, the pricing of our products and services, the 
extensive distribution channels available for our customers, our 
innovation, and our reputation. Continued or increased 
competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect 
our customer relationships, market share and results of 
operations and/or cause us to increase our capital investment in 
our businesses in order to remain competitive. In addition, our 
ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from 
time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly 
by the current economic, regulatory and political environment for 
large financial institutions as well as by the actions of our 
competitors. Furthermore, any changes in the types of products 
and services that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for 
those products and services could result in a loss of customer 
relationships and market share and could materially adversely 
affect our results of operations. 

Continued technological advances and the growth of 

e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository 
institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were 
banking products, and for financial institutions and other 
companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial 
solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and 
payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including 
digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may 
diminish the importance of depository institutions and other

financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. 
We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive 
threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to 
sell products at lower prices, increase our investment in our 
business to modify or adapt our existing products and services, 
and/or develop new products and services to respond to our 
customers’ needs and preferences. To the extent we are not 
successful in developing and introducing new products and 
services or responding or adapting to the competitive landscape 
or to changes in customer preferences, we may lose customer 
relationships and our revenue growth and results of operations 
may be materially adversely affected. 

Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical 
to the success of our business and failure to do so could 
adversely affect our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is 
heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, 
including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, 
including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, 
capital markets, risk management and technology, the 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also 
seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of 
succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract 
and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide 
competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, 
effectively manage employee performance and development, 
and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large 
financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain 
subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on 
compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our 
ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially 
if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same 
compensation limitations. If we are unable to continue to attract 
and retain qualified employees, including successors for senior 
leadership positions, our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects may be adversely affected. 

FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS 

Changes in accounting policies or accounting standards, and 
changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or 
applied, could materially affect how we report our financial 
results and condition.  Our accounting policies are fundamental 
to determining and understanding our financial results and 
condition. As described below, some of these policies require use 
of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Any changes in our 
accounting policies could materially affect our financial 
statements. 

From time to time the FASB and the SEC change the 
financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the 
preparation of our external financial statements. In addition, 
accounting standard setters and those who interpret the 
accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators 
and our outside auditors) may change or even reverse their 
previous interpretations or positions on how these standards 
should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting 
standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond 
our control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect 
how we report our financial results and condition. We may be 
required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply 
an existing standard differently, also retroactively, in each case 
potentially resulting in our restating prior period financial 
statements in material amounts. 

For additional information, see the “Current Accounting 

Developments” section in this Report. 

Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and 
estimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in 
the future, and our financial statements depend on our internal 
controls over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are 
required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing 
our financial statements, including in determining credit loss 
reserves, reserves related to litigation, and the fair value of 
certain assets and liabilities, among other items. Several of our 
accounting policies are critical because they require management 
to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about 
matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that 
materially different amounts would be reported under different 
conditions or using different assumptions. For a description of 
these policies, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in 
this Report. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial 
statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. 
Certain of our financial instruments, including derivative 
assets and liabilities, debt securities, certain loans, MSRs, private 
equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and 
resale agreements, among other items, require a determination 
of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. 
Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair 
value determinations based on internally developed models or 
other means which ultimately rely to some degree on 
management judgment, and there is no assurance that our 
models will capture or appropriately reflect all relevant inputs 
required to accurately determine fair value. Some of these and 
other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price 
levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based 
on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden 
illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and 
securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance 
sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such 
valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and 
could lead to declines in our earnings. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires 
our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control 
over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual 
report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” 
in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not 
identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any 
given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock 
price of disclosure of a material weakness. In addition, our 
customers may rely on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
as a service provider, and any deficiency in those controls could 
affect our customers and damage our reputation or business. 
Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit services our 
outside auditors may provide to us in order to preserve their 
independence from us. If our auditors were found not to be 
“independent” of us under SEC rules, we could be required to 
engage new auditors and re-file financial statements and audit 
reports with the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC 
rules until new financial statements and audit reports were filed, 
limiting our ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse 
consequences.
