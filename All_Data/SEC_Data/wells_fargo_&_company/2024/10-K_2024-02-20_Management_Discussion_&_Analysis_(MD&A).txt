This Annual Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, 
which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those 
forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking 
statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are 
described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” 
sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). 

When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries 
(consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used 
throughout this Report. 

Financial Review 

Overview 

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company 
that has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a 
diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products 
and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, 
through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer 
Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and 
Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. 
Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s 2023 rankings of 
America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and 
third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. 
banks at December 31, 2023. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control 

infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The 
Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other 
regulatory actions, some of which are described below. These 
regulatory actions may require the Company, among other 
things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, 
products and services, and risk management practices. 
Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple 
years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays 
along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely 
to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and 
control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory 
actions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating 
consequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or 
have repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one 
regulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to 
satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis 
could result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, 
limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or 
liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse 
consequences, which could be significant. While we still have 
significant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects 
of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to 
devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong 
business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of 
integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. 

Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding 
Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational 
Risk Management 
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order 
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of 
Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance 
the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the 
Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the 
Company’s compliance and operational risk management 
program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the 

Company works to address the consent order provisions. The 
consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s 
acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s 
adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial 
third-party review of the enhancements and improvements 
provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete 
and the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction 
of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined 
under the consent order will be limited to the level as of 
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured 
on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of 
temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second 
third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy 
and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. 

Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program, 
Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and 
Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions 
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders 
with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an 
aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate 
lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company 
submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance 
risk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s 
internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial 
law and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required 
by the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-
objection plans to remediate customers affected by the 
automobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage 
interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management 
of remediation activities conducted by the Company. The 
Company continues to work to address the provisions of the 
consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a 
$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to 
insufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s 
April 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the 
Company’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the 
CFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would 
terminate.

Recent Developments 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment 
In November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit 
insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. 
Under the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based 
on a calculation using an insured depository institution’s (IDI) 
estimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s 
finalization of the rule, we expensed the entire estimated amount 
of our special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be 
paid over eight quarters beginning in June 2024. The amount of 
our special assessment may change as the FDIC determines the 
actual losses to the deposit insurance fund and evaluates any 
amendments by IDIs to uninsured deposit amounts reported for 
December 31, 2022. 

Overdraft Fees Proposal 
On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would 
limit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a 
significant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in 
deposit-related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed. 

Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal 
On October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would 
reduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by 
debit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for 
an update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year 
based on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card 
issuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card 
interchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is 
adopted as currently proposed. 

Capital Matters 
On July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed 
rule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would 
impact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The 
proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach 
and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the 
measurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular 
risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a 
new standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The 
new requirements would be phased in over a three-year period 
beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant 
increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its 
capital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed 
rule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to 
address the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet 
and capital optimization strategies. 

For additional information about capital planning, see the 

“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” 
section in this Report. 

Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation 
Activities 
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the OCC requiring the Company to improve the 
execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation 
activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent 
order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party 
residential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain 
mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the 
Company’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is 
provided. 

Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile 
Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage 
Lending 
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent 
order with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer 
remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, 
consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain 
practices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive 
refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile 
protection agreements; comply with certain business practice 
requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a 
$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related 
to many of these matters were already substantially complete at 
the time we entered into the consent order, and the consent 
order lays out a path to termination after the Company 
completes the remainder of the required actions. 

Retail Sales Practices Matters 
In September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, 
the OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and 
entered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, 
in connection with allegations that some of our retail customers 
received products and services they did not request. As a result, it 
remains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive 
action plan that includes making things right for our customers, 
employees, and other stakeholders, and building a better 
Company for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB 
consent order regarding retail sales practices expired. On 
February 15, 2024, the OCC announced the termination of its 
consent order regarding retail sales practices. 

Customer Remediation Activities 
Our priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify 
areas or instances where customers may have experienced 
financial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and 
implement additional operational and control procedures. We are 
working with our regulatory agencies in this effort. 

We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs 
related to our customer remediation activities, which amounts 
may change based on additional facts and information, as well as 
ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We 
had $819 million and $2.3 billion of accrued liabilities for 
customer remediation activities as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we 
continue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we 
have identified and may in the future identify additional items or 
areas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we 
will continue to assess any customer harm and provide 
remediation as appropriate.

Credit Quality 
Credit quality reflected the following: 
• 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of 
$15.1 billion at December 31, 2023, increased $1.5 billion 
from December 31, 2022. 

•  Our provision for credit losses for loans was $5.4 billion in 

• 

• 

2023, compared with $1.5 billion in 2022. The ACL for loans 
and the provision for credit losses for loans reflected 
increases for commercial real estate loans, primarily office 
loans, as well as for increases in credit card loan balances. 
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.61% at 
December 31, 2023, compared with 1.42% at December 31, 
2022. 
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were 
$923 million, or 17 basis points of average commercial loans, 
in 2023, compared with net loan charge-offs of $79 million 
in 2022, due to higher losses in all commercial portfolios, 
primarily in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by 
the office property type. 
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $2.5 billion, or 
65 basis points of average consumer loans, in 2023, 
compared with net loan charge-offs of $1.5 billion, or 
39 basis points, in 2022, due to higher losses in all consumer 
portfolios, primarily in our credit card portfolio. 
•  Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $8.4 billion at 

• 

December 31, 2023, increased $2.7 billion, or 47%, from 
December 31, 2022, driven by higher commercial real estate 
nonaccrual loans, predominantly within the office property 
type, partially offset by lower residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans. NPAs represented 0.90% of total loans at 
December 31, 2023. 
Criticized loans in the commercial portfolio were 
$33.0 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with 
$25.1 billion at December 31, 2022, primarily driven by an 
increase in criticized commercial real estate loans in the 
office and apartments property types.

Overview (continued) 

Financial Performance 
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 
In first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – 
Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted 
Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. 

We adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which 

required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior 
period risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related 
metrics were not revised. For additional information, including 
the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of 
ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

In 2023, we generated $19.1 billion of net income and diluted 
earnings per common share (EPS) of $4.83, compared with 
$13.7 billion of net income and diluted EPS of $3.27 in 2022. 
Financial performance for 2023, compared with 2022, included 
the following: 
• 

total revenue increased due to higher net interest income 
and higher noninterest income; 
provision for credit losses reflected increases for commercial 
real estate loans, primarily office loans, as well as for 
increases in credit card loan balances; 
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating 
losses, partially offset by higher personnel expense and 
higher other expense driven by an FDIC special assessment; 
average loans increased driven by loan growth in both our 
commercial and consumer loan portfolios; and 
average deposits decreased driven by reductions in 
Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, and 
Wealth and Investment Management, partially offset by 
growth in Corporate and Investment Banking and Corporate.

Capital and Liquidity 
We maintained a strong capital position in 2023, with total 
equity of $187.4 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with 
$182.2 billion at December 31, 2022. In addition, capital and 
liquidity at December 31, 2023, included the following: 
• 

our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.43% under 
the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 
8.90%; 
our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of 
total risk-weighted assets was 25.05%, compared with the 
regulatory minimum of 21.50%; and 
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 125%, which 
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%.

See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” 
sections in this Report for additional information regarding our 
capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital and liquidity amounts.

In first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to 
the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts. We adopted ASU 2018-12 with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and 
certain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, including the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. 
Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders’ equity. 
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than 
mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible 
common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it 
enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) financial measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report. 
The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
See the “Capital Management” section and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
Represents TLAC divided by risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. 
Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. 
Dividend payout ratio is dividends declared per common share as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share.

Wells Fargo & Company 

Net interest income and net interest margin increased in 

2023, compared with 2022, driven by the impact of higher 
interest rates, which resulted in both higher interest income on 
interest-earning assets and higher interest expense for interest-
bearing deposits and long-term debt. 

Table 3 presents the individual components of net interest 

income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net 
interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in 
Table 3 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-
exempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% 
federal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021. 

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for 2023 was $19.1 billion ($4.83 diluted 
EPS), compared with $13.7 billion ($3.27 diluted EPS) in 2022. 
Net income increased in 2023, compared with 2022, 
predominantly due to a $7.4 billion increase in net interest 
income and a $1.6 billion decrease in noninterest expense, 
partially offset by a $3.9 billion increase in provision for credit 
losses. 

For a discussion of our 2022 financial results, compared with 

2021, see the “Earnings Performance” section of our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. 

Net interest income and the net interest margin in any one 

period can be significantly affected by a variety of factors 
including the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio 
and the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources 
of interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and 
collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from 
period to period.

The average balance amounts represent amortized costs, except for certain held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, which exclude unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of those 
securities from available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. The average interest rates are based on interest income or expense amounts for the period and are annualized. Interest rates and amounts 
include the effects of hedge and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories. 

(2)  Nonaccrual loans and any related income are included in their respective loan categories.

Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $420 million, $436 million, and $427 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, predominantly related to tax-exempt

Table 4 allocates the changes in net interest income on a 
taxable-equivalent basis to changes in either average balances or 
average rates for both interest-earning assets and interest-
bearing liabilities. Because of the numerous simultaneous volume 
and rate changes during any period, it is not possible to precisely 

allocate such changes between volume and rate. For this table, 
changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are 
allocated to these categories on a pro-rata basis based on the 
absolute value of the change due to average volume and average 
rate.

Full year 2023 vs. full year 2022 

Deposit-related fees decreased reflecting: 
• 
• 

our efforts to help customers avoid overdraft fees; and 
lower fees on commercial accounts driven by higher earnings 
credits due to an increase in interest rates. 

Investment advisory and other asset-based fees decreased 
reflecting net outflows of advisory assets and lower market 
valuations. 

Fees from the majority of Wealth and Investment 

Management (WIM) advisory assets are based on a percentage 
of the market value of the assets at the beginning of the quarter. 
For additional information on certain client investment assets, 
see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment Results – 
Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory Assets” 
section in this Report. 

Commissions and brokerage services fees increased due to 
higher service fee rates and higher transactional revenue. 

Investment banking fees increased due to increased activity 
across all products, as well as a write-down on unfunded 
leveraged finance commitments in 2022. 

Net servicing income decreased driven by: 
• 

lower servicing fees due to a lower balance of mortgage 
loans serviced for others, including the impact of MSR sales; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher income from net hedge results related to MSR 
valuations. 

Net gains on mortgage loan originations/sales decreased 
due to lower residential mortgage origination volumes related to 
higher interest rates and our more focused strategy for Home 
Lending, including our exit from the correspondent business. 

For additional information on net servicing income and net 

gains on mortgage loan originations/sales, see Note 6 (Mortgage 
Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Net gains from trading activities increased driven by improved 
trading results across all asset classes. 

Net gains from debt securities decreased due to lower gains on 
sales of asset-based securities and municipal bonds in our 
investment portfolio as a result of decreased sales volumes. 

lower impairment of equity securities; and 
higher unrealized gains on marketable equity securities; 

Net losses from equity securities decreased reflecting: 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower unrealized and realized gains on nonmarketable equity 
securities driven by our venture capital and private equity 
investments. 

Other income decreased driven by the change in fair value of 
liabilities associated with our reinsurance business, which was 
recognized as a result of our adoption of ASU 2018-12 in first 
quarter 2023. For additional information on our adoption of ASU 
2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Includes expenses for legal actions of $179 million, $3.3 billion, and $341 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and expenses for customer remediation 
activities of $207 million, $2.7 billion, and $536 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Represents expenses for assets we lease to customers. 

Full year 2023 vs. full year 2022 

• 

higher severance expense for planned actions; and 
higher incentive compensation expense; 

Personnel expense increased due to: 
• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower revenue-related compensation expense driven by 
lower origination volumes in Home Lending. 

For additional information on personnel expense, see 
Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense 
increased due to higher expense for software maintenance and 
licenses and for the amortization of internally developed 
software. 

Operating losses decreased driven by: 
• 

lower expense for legal actions, compared with higher 
expense in 2022 that included amounts related to the 
December 2022 CFPB consent order. For additional 
information on legal actions, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report; and 

lower expense for customer remediation activities, 
compared with higher expense in 2022 that included 
amounts related to the further refinement of the scope of 
remediation for historical mortgage lending, automobile 
lending, and consumer deposit accounts matters. Expenses 
for customer remediation activities in 2023 were lower 
related to matters that had lower estimated costs and 
complexity than historical matters. For additional 
information on customer remediation activities, see the 
“Overview” section above. 

As previously disclosed, we have outstanding legal actions 

and customer remediation activities that could impact operating 
losses in the coming quarters. 

For additional information on operating losses, see Note 21 
(Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Advertising and promotion expense increased due to higher 
marketing volume. 

Other expense increased reflecting a $1.9 billion FDIC special 
assessment. For additional information on the FDIC’s special 
assessment, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Represents (i) Income tax expense (benefit) divided by (ii) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) less Net income (loss) from noncontrolling interests. 

Income tax expense for 2023, compared with 2022, 
increased due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by the 
impact of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior 
period tax matters. The effective income tax rate for 2023, 
compared with 2022, decreased primarily due to the impact of 
discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax 
matters.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Operating Segment Results 
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable 
operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; 
Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and 
Wealth and Investment Management. All other business 
activities that are not included in the reportable operating 
segments have been included in Corporate. For additional 
information, see Table 8. We define our reportable operating 
segments by type of product and customer segment, and their 
results are based on our management reporting process. The 
management reporting process measures the performance of 
the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s 
management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed 
with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior 
management. The management reporting process is based on 
U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds 
transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue 
and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to 
consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt 
sources, which allows management to assess performance 
consistently across the operating segments. 

Funds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds 
transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating 
segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a 
funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in 
net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or 
credits is recognized in corporate treasury. 

Revenue and Expense Sharing  When lines of business jointly 
serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for 
providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense 
with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of 
business based on established internal revenue-sharing 
agreements. 

Table 8:  Management Reporting Structure 

When a line of business uses a service provided by another 
line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), 
expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the 
service provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue 
and expense allocation methodologies. 

Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent 
adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and 
debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-
equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-
income housing and renewable energy investments are included 
in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts 
to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in 
Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment 
Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s 
consolidated financial results. 

Allocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated 
capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based 
on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the 
assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are 
periodically assessed and updated. Effective January 1, 2023, 
management modified its capital allocation methodology to 
improve alignment of allocated capital with the binding 
regulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes 
that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure 
because it enables management, investors, and others to assess 
a reportable operating segment’s use of capital. 

Selected Metrics  We present certain financial and nonfinancial 
metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable 
operating segment results. Management believes that these 
metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the 
performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable 
operating segments or lines of business.

Return on allocated capital is segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock divided by segment average allocated capital. Segment net income (loss) applicable to common stock is segment 
net income (loss) less allocated preferred stock dividends. 
Efficiency ratio is segment noninterest expense divided by segment total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
Digital and mobile active customers is based on the number of consumer and small business customers who have logged on via a digital or mobile device, respectively, in the prior 90 days. Digital 
active customers includes both online and mobile customers. 
Deposit spread is (i) the internal funds transfer pricing credit on segment deposits minus interest paid to customers for segment deposits, divided by (ii) average segment deposits. 
Debit card purchase volume and transactions reflect combined activity for both consumer and business debit card purchases. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans subserviced for others. 
Excludes residential mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 
Excludes loans held for sale. 
Excludes nonaccrual loans. 

Full year 2023 vs. full year 2022 

Provision for credit losses increased driven by credit card loan 
growth. 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates 
and deposit spreads, partially offset by lower deposit 
balances; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower mortgage banking noninterest income due to lower 
residential mortgage origination volumes related to higher 
interest rates and our more focused strategy for Home 
Lending, including our exit from the correspondent business, 
as well as lower servicing income, including the impact of 
MSR sales; and 
lower deposit-related fees reflecting our efforts to help 
customers avoid overdraft fees. 

• 

Noninterest expense decreased due to: 
• 

lower operating losses driven by lower expense for legal 
actions and customer remediation activities; and 
lower personnel expense driven by the impact of efficiency 
initiatives, as well as lower revenue-related compensation 
expense due to lower origination volumes in Home Lending; 

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher advertising costs due to higher marketing volume.

• 

a decline in loan balances in our Home Lending business 
driven by a decrease in residential mortgage origination 
volumes related to higher interest rates and our more 
focused strategy for Home Lending, including our exit from

a decline in loan balances in our Auto business due to lower

• 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher loan balances in our Credit Card business driven by 
higher point of sale volume and the impact of new product 
launches. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased due to 
consumer deposit outflows on consumer spending, as well as 
customer migration to higher yielding alternatives.

Provision for credit losses reflected loan growth. 

Revenue increased driven by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates 
and higher loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit 
balances; 
partially offset by: 
• 

lower deposit-related fees driven by the impact of higher 
earnings credits, which resulted in lower fees for commercial 
customers; and 
lower other noninterest income due to lower net gains from 
equity securities, partially offset by higher revenue from 
renewable energy investments. 

• 

Noninterest expense increased due to higher operating costs 
and personnel expense, including severance expense, partially 
offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives.

Total loans (average) increased driven by loan growth and higher 
average line utilization in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. 

Total loans (period-end) increased driven by loan growth in 
Asset-Based Lending and Leasing due to an increase in client 
working capital needs, partially offset by lower line utilization for 
commercial and industrial loans in Middle Market Banking. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased due to 
customer migration to higher yielding alternatives, partially 
offset by additions of deposits from new and existing customers.

Provision for credit losses increased reflecting a $1.6 billion 
increase in the allowance for credit losses driven by commercial 
real estate office loans. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by higher operating costs 
and personnel expense, including severance expense, partially 
offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives.

Total loans (average and period-end) decreased driven by lower 
originations. 

Total trading-related assets (average and period-end) 
increased reflecting: 
• 
• 

increased volume of reverse repurchase agreements; and 
higher trading account securities driven by higher mortgage-
backed securities; 

partially offset by: 
• 

lower trading-related derivative assets due to declines in 
derivative balances for commodities and equities. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
additions of deposits from new and existing customers.

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower investment advisory and other asset-based fees due 
to net outflows of advisory assets and lower market 
valuations; 
partially offset by: 
• 

higher commissions and brokerage services fees due to 
higher service fee rates and higher transactional revenue. 

Noninterest expense increased driven by: 
• 

higher personnel expense driven by higher revenue-related 
compensation and severance expense; and 
higher operating costs; 

• 
partially offset by: 
• 

the impact of efficiency initiatives. 

Total deposits (average and period-end) decreased due to 
customer migration to higher yielding alternatives.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

WIM Advisory Assets  In addition to transactional accounts, 
WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage 
customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a 
percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning 
of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the 
distinct services provided, and are affected by investment 
performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory 
accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and 
separately managed by third-party managers as well as certain 
client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory 
and other services, but do not have investment discretion. 

WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high 
net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage 
of the market value of these assets. Table 9h presents advisory 
assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes 
that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows 
management, investors, and others to assess how changes in 
asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based 
fees. 

For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 

the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 
basis points.

Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests predominantly associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 

Full year 2023 vs. full year 2022 

Revenue decreased driven by: 
• 

lower other noninterest income reflecting the change in fair 
value of liabilities associated with our reinsurance business, 
which was recognized as a result of our adoption of ASU 
2018-12 in first quarter 2023. For additional information on 
our adoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in 
this Report; and 
lower net gains from debt securities due to lower gains on 
sales of asset-based securities and municipal bonds in our 
investment portfolio as a result of decreased sales volumes; 

partially offset by: 
• 

higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates; 
and 
higher net gains on equity securities driven by lower 
impairment of equity securities and higher unrealized gains 
on marketable equity securities, partially offset by lower 
unrealized and realized gains on nonmarketable equity 
securities from our venture capital and private equity 
investments.

• 

Corporate includes our rail car leasing business, which had 

long-lived operating lease assets, net of accumulated 
depreciation, of $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively. The average age of our rail cars is 
22 years and the rail cars are typically leased to customers under 
short-term leases of 3 to 5 years. Our four largest 
concentrations, which represented 66% of our rail car fleet as of 
December 31, 2023, were rail cars used for the transportation of 
cement/sand, agricultural grain, plastics, and coal products. We 
may incur impairment charges in the future based on changing 
economic and market conditions affecting the long-term 
demand and utility of specific types of rail cars. Our assumptions 
for impairment are sensitive to estimated utilization and rental 
rates as well as the estimated economic life of the leased asset. 
For additional information on the accounting for impairment of 
operating lease assets, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 8 (Leasing Activity) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Noninterest expense decreased driven by: 
• 

lower operating losses due to lower expense for legal 
actions; 
partially offset by: 
• 
• 

a $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment; and 
higher personnel expense driven by higher severance 
expense.

In first quarter 2023, we reclassified HTM debt securities with a fair value of $23.2 billion to AFS debt securities in connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-01 – Derivatives and Hedging 
(Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Full year 2023 vs. full year 2022 

Total assets (period-end) increased driven by: 
• 

an increase in cash and due from banks, and interest-earning 
deposits with banks that are managed by corporate treasury 
as a result of an increase in issuances of certificates of 
deposits (CDs) and long-term debt, partially offset by a 
reduction in deposits held by our operating segments; and 
sales of and net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities. 

• 

Total deposits (average and period-end) increased driven by 
issuances of CDs.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses of $1 million and $6 million related to available-for-sale debt securities and $93 million and $85 million related to 
held-to-maturity debt securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. 

The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of 

AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 
2022. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities were more than 
offset by paydowns and maturities, as well as sales of AFS debt 
securities. We reclassified HTM debt securities with an aggregate 
fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost of $23.9 billion to 
AFS debt securities in 2023 in connection with the adoption of 
ASU 2022-01. In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities 
with a fair value of $3.7 billion to HTM debt securities in 2023 
due to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital 
management purposes. Debt securities transferred from AFS to 
HTM in 2023 had $320 million of pre-tax unrealized losses at the 
time of the transfers. 

The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt 

securities decreased from December 31, 2022, due to changes in 
interest rates. 

At December 31, 2023, 99% of the combined AFS and HTM 

debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are 
based on external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available-
for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and 
HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by 
security type. 

Table 10 presents a summary of our portfolio of 

investments in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity 
(HTM) debt securities. The size and composition of our AFS and 
HTM debt securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity 
and interest rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt 
securities portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise 
in the normal course of business or due to market stress. 
Changes in our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes 
in overall economic or market conditions, which could influence 
loan origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances 
and mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be 
rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk 
management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and 
interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt 
securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other 
short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for additional information 
on liquidity and interest rate risk. 

The AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The portfolio also 
includes securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions 
and highly rated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). 

The HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of 

liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and 
agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. 
states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Debt 
securities are classified as HTM at the time of purchase or when 
transferred from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Our intent is 
to hold these securities to maturity and collect the contractual 
cash flows. In first quarter 2023, we changed our intent with 
respect to certain HTM debt securities and reclassified them to 
AFS debt securities in connection with the adoption of ASU 
2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value 
Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method. For additional information on 
our adoption of ASU 2022-01, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Balance Sheet Analysis (continued) 

Loan Portfolios 
Table 11 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by 
portfolio segment. Commercial loans decreased from 
December 31, 2022, due to decreases in both the commercial 
and industrial and commercial real estate loan portfolios 

as paydowns exceeded originations and advances. Consumer 
loans decreased from December 31, 2022, as increases in the 
credit card portfolio were more than offset by decreases in the 
residential mortgage loan portfolio as well as the auto loan 
portfolio.

• 
• 
partially offset by: 
• 

customer migration to higher yielding alternatives; and 
consumer deposit outflows on consumer spending; 

higher time deposits driven by issuances of CDs. 

Table 13 provides additional information regarding deposit 

balances. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net 
interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is 
provided in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” 
section and Table 3 earlier in this Report. Our average deposit 
cost in fourth quarter 2023 increased to 1.58%, compared with 
0.46% in fourth quarter 2022, as a result of higher interest rates 
and shifts in deposit mix.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet, or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in 
amounts that are different from the full contract or notional 
amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements 
include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with 
unconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. 
These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs 
of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, 
and/or (3) diversify our funding sources. 

Unfunded Credit Commitments 
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to 
lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, 
contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required 
collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will 
generally be lower than the contractual amount because these 
commitments may expire without being used or may be 
cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring 
activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to 
individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity 
structure of these commitments. For additional information, see 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 16 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Other Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, 
written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing 
house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar 
arrangements. For additional information, see Note 17 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Commitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities 
We enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale 
agreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase 
debt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ 
funding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional 
information, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) 
to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at 
fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional 
amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the 
basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The 
notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance 
sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure 
of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, 
see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and 
other stakeholders. 

Risk is Part of our Business Model.  Risk is the possibility of an 
event occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability 
to achieve its strategic and business objectives. The Company 
routinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its 
customers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest 
rate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, 
such as operational (which includes compliance and model risks), 
strategic and reputation risks. 

Risk Profile.  The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the 
aggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and 
business activities after taking into consideration risk 
management effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk 
profile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. 

Risk Capacity.  Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that 
the Company could assume given its current level of resources 
before triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital 
and liquidity needs. 

Risk Appetite.  Risk appetite is the nature and level of risk the 
Company is willing to take, within its risk capacity, while pursuing 
its strategic and business objectives. Risk appetite is articulated 
in our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable 
risks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The 
Company’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior 
management, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps 
guide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company 
continuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews 
reports which include risk appetite information and analysis. 

Risk and Strategy.  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the 
Company’s strategic planning process, which identifies the 
Company’s most significant opportunities and challenges, 
develops plans to address them, evaluates the risks of those 
plans, and articulates the resulting decisions in the form of a 
company-wide strategic plan. The Company’s risk profile, risk 
capacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are 
considered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with 
the Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s 
Independent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates 
in strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent 
assessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM 
also independently assesses and challenges the impact of the 
strategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk 
management effectiveness at the principal lines of business, 
enterprise functions, and aggregate Company levels. The 
strategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s 
evaluation. 

Risk and Climate Change.  The Company views climate change as 
a global challenge that presents significant impacts for 
businesses and communities around the world. The Company 
expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk 
types it manages, and the Company continues to integrate 
climate considerations into its risk management framework as its 
understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. 

Risk is Managed by Everyone.  Every employee, in the course of 
their daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing 
risk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, 
including establishing and maintaining the Company’s risk and 
control environment. Every employee must comply with 
applicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. 

Risk and Culture.  Senior management sets the tone at the top 
by supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s 
expectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees 
conduct themselves and make decisions. The Board is 
responsible for holding senior management accountable for 
establishing and maintaining this culture and effectively 
managing risk. Senior management expects employees to speak 
up when they see something that could cause harm to the 
Company’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, 
or reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s 
responsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to 
challenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their 
concerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s 
performance management and incentive compensation 
programs are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk 
and reward under core principles that employees are expected to 
know and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources 
Committee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing 
credible challenge to the Company’s performance management 
and incentive compensation programs. Effective risk 
management is a central component of employee performance 
evaluations. 

Risk Management Framework.  The Company’s risk 
management framework sets forth the Company’s core 
principles for managing and governing its risk. It is approved by 
the Board’s Risk Committee and reviewed and updated annually. 
Many other documents and policies flow from its core principles. 

Wells Fargo’s top priority is to strengthen our company by 
building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure. We 
continue to enhance and mature our risk management programs, 
including operational and compliance risk management programs 
as required by the FRB’s February 2, 2018, and the CFPB/OCC’s 
April 20, 2018, consent orders. 

Risk Governance 
Role of the Board.  The Board oversees the Company’s business, 
including its risk management. It assesses senior management’s 
performance and holds senior management accountable for 
maintaining and adhering to an effective risk management 
program. 

Board Committee Structure.  The Board carries out its risk 
oversight responsibilities directly and through its committees. 
The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Company’s risk 
management framework and oversees management’s 
implementation of the framework, including how the Company 
manages and governs risk. The Risk Committee also oversees the 
Company’s adherence to its risk appetite. In addition, the Risk 
Committee supports the stature, authority and independence of 
IRM and oversees and receives reports on its operation. The Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO) reports functionally to the Risk Committee 
and administratively to the CEO.

Wells Fargo & Company 

Management Committee Structure.  The Company has 
established management committees, including those focused 
on risk, that support management in carrying out its governance 
and risk management responsibilities. One type of management 
committee is a governance committee, which is a decision-
making body that operates for a particular purpose and may 
report to a Board committee. 

Each management governance committee, in accordance 

with its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make 
decisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging 

risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review 
and monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and 
remediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key 
challenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues 
as appropriate. 

Table 15 presents, as of December 31, 2023, the structure 

of the Company’s Board committees and escalation paths of 
relevant management governance committees reporting to a 
Board committee.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and 
external auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 

Management Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk 
Committee of the Board.  The Enterprise Risk & Control 
Committee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that 
governs the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives 
information about risk and control issues, addresses escalated 
risks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC 
also makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to 
the Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives 
regular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management 
regarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management program. 

The ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, with  

membership comprising the heads of principal lines of business 
and certain enterprise functions. The Chief Auditor or a designee 
attends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct 
escalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an 
escalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the 
Human Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate 
directly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC 
in accordance with the Company’s escalation management 
policy. 

Each principal line of business and enterprise function has a 
risk and control committee, which is a management governance 
committee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its 
scope limited to the respective principal line of business or 

enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider 
risks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise 
function generate and manage, and the controls the principal line 
of business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. 
As a complement to these risk and control committees, 
management governance committees dedicated to specific risk 
types and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more 
comprehensive governance of risks. 

Risk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities 
The Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the 
Front Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. 
• 

Front Line  The Front Line, which comprises principal line of 
business and certain enterprise function activities, is the first 
line of defense. The Front Line is responsible for 
understanding the risks generated by its activities, applying 
adequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its 
business activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and 
assesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated 
by or associated with its business activities and balances risk 
and reward in decision making while operating within the 
Company’s risk appetite. 
Independent Risk Management  IRM is the second line of 
defense. It establishes and maintains the Company’s risk 
management program and provides oversight, including 
challenge to and independent assessment and monitoring 

•

• 

of, the Front Line’s execution of its risk management 
responsibilities. 
Internal Audit  Internal Audit is the third line of defense. It is 
responsible for acting as an independent assurance function 
and validates that the risk management program is 
adequately designed and functioning effectively. 

Risk Type Classifications 
The Company uses common classifications, hierarchies, and 
ratings to enable consistency across risk management programs 
and aggregation of information. Risk type classifications permit 
the Company to identify and prioritize its risk exposures, 
including emerging risk exposures. 

Operational Risk Management 
Operational risk, which in addition to those discussed in this 
section, includes compliance risk and model risk, is the risk 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems, or from external events. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for operational risk, including significant 
supporting programs and/or policies regarding the Company’s 
business resiliency and disaster recovery, change management, 
data management, information security, technology, and third-
party risk management. As part of its oversight responsibilities, 
the Board’s Risk Committee reviews and approves significant 
operational risk policies and oversees the Company’s operational 
risk management program. 

At the management level, Operational Risk Management, 

which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for operational 
risk. Operational Risk Management reports to the CRO and 
provides periodic reports related to operational risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. Operational Risk Management’s 
oversight responsibilities include change management risk, data 
management risk, fraud risk, human capital risk, information 
management risk, information security risk, technology risk, and 
third-party risk. 

Information Security Risk Management.  Information security 
risk, which includes cybersecurity risk, is a significant operational 
risk for financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and includes the 
risk arising from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction of information or information 
systems. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for information security risk and approves the 
Company’s information security program, which includes 
information protection and cyber resiliency. The Risk Committee 
receives regular reports from the Company’s Head of 
Technology, as well as from Operational Risk Management 
representatives, on information security risks, and the Board 
receives a report from the Head of Technology on Wells Fargo’s 
information security program and receives reports from 
management on significant information security developments, 
including certain incidents involving third parties. 

As described above, at the management level, Operational 
Risk Management has oversight responsibility for information 
security risk. As a second line of defense, Operational Risk 
Management reviews and provides guidance to the Front Line 
technology team, including with respect to the development and 
maintenance of risk management policies, governance 
documents, processes, and controls, and oversees and challenges 
the Front Line technology team’s risk assessment activities. 
The Company’s cybersecurity team, which is part of the 

broader technology team, provides Front Line information 

security risk assessment and management and is responsible for 
protecting the Company’s information systems, networks, and 
data, including customer and employee data, through the design, 
execution, and oversight of our information security program. 
The technology team is led by the Company’s Head of 

Technology, who reports to the CEO and leads our efforts to 
manage information security and related risks across the 
enterprise, including overseeing the Company’s Chief 
Information Security Officer (CISO). Our Head of Technology has 
nearly 20 years of technology and information security risk 
management experience in the financial services industry, 
including prior roles with Wells Fargo as Chief Information 
Officer for the Consumer Technology group and the Enterprise 
Functions Technology group. Prior to joining Wells Fargo, our 
Head of Technology served as Chief Operations and Technology 
Officer at a financing and investment solutions company, and 
prior to that served in several technology leadership roles at large 
financial institutions. 

The Company has processes designed to prevent, detect, 

mitigate, escalate, and remediate cybersecurity incidents, 
including monitoring of the Company’s networks for actual or 
potential attacks or breaches. The Company’s incident response 
program includes notification, escalation, and remediation 
protocols for cybersecurity incidents, including to our Head of 
Technology and CISO. In addition, to help monitor and assess our 
exposure to ongoing and evolving risks in these areas, the 
Company has a cyber and information security focused risk 
committee led by the CISO and a technology risk committee led 
by the Head of Technology. 

Additional components of the Company’s information 
security program include: (i) enhancing and strengthening of our 
practices, policies, and procedures in response to the evolving 
information security landscape; (ii) designing our information 
security program to align with regulatory and industry standards; 
(iii) investing in emerging technologies to proactively monitor 
new vulnerabilities and reduce risk; (iv) conducting periodic 
internal and third-party assessments to test our information 
security systems and controls; (v) leveraging third-party 
specialists and advisors to review and strengthen our information 
security program; (vi) evaluating and updating our incident 
response planning and protocols; and (vii) requiring employees 
and third-party service providers who have access to our systems 
to complete annual information security training modules 
designed to provide guidance for identifying and avoiding 
information security risks. 

In addition, Operational Risk Management oversees the 
Company’s third-party risk management program, which, among 
other things, is designed to identify and address information 
security risks arising from third-party service providers. 
Components of this program include incorporating information 
security and cybersecurity incident notification requirements 
into contracts with third-party service providers, requiring third 
parties to adhere to defined information security and control 
standards, and performing periodic third-party risk assessments. 
Wells Fargo and other financial institutions, as well as our 
third-party service providers, continue to be the target of various 
evolving and adaptive information security threats, including 
cyber attacks, malware, ransomware, other malicious software 
intended to exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, 
phishing, credential validation, and distributed denial-of-service, 
in an effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test 
their cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain 
confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks 
have also focused on targeting online applications and services, 
such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products 

30 

Wells Fargo & Company 

and services provided by third parties, and have targeted the 
infrastructure of the internet causing the widespread 
unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As 
a result, information security and the continued development 
and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems 
designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data 
from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for 
Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is also involved in industry cybersecurity 
efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party 
service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to 
enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security 
threats. See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for 
additional information regarding the risks and potential impacts 
associated with a failure or breach of our operational or security 
systems or infrastructure, including as a result of cyber attacks or 
other information security incidents. 

Compliance Risk Management 
Compliance risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk resulting 
from the failure to comply with laws (legislation, regulations and 
rules) and regulatory guidance, and the failure to appropriately 
address associated impact, including to customers. Compliance 
risk encompasses violations of applicable internal policies, 
program requirements, procedures, and standards related to 
ethical principles applicable to the Company. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for all aspects of compliance risk, including financial 
crimes risk. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board’s 
Risk Committee reviews and approves significant supporting 
compliance risk and financial crimes risk policies and programs 
and oversees the Company’s compliance risk management and 
financial crimes risk management programs. 

Conduct risk, a sub-category of compliance risk, is the risk of 

inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior on the part of 
employees or individuals acting on behalf of the Company, 
caused by deliberate or unintentional actions or business 
practices. In connection with its oversight of conduct risk, the 
Board oversees the alignment of employee conduct to the 
Company’s risk appetite (which the Board approves annually). 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility 
for conduct risk and risk management components of the 
Company’s culture, while the responsibilities of the Board’s 
Human Resources Committee include oversight of the 
Company’s culture, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, 
human capital management (including talent management and 
succession planning), performance management program, and 
incentive compensation risk management program. 

At the management level, the Compliance function, which is 

part of IRM, monitors the implementation of the Company’s 
compliance and conduct risk programs. Financial Crimes Risk 
Management, which is part of the Compliance function, oversees 
and monitors financial crimes risk. The Compliance function 
reports to the CRO and provides periodic reports related to 
compliance risk to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Model Risk Management 
Model risk (a type of operational risk) is the risk arising from the 
potential for adverse consequences of decisions made based on 
model output that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. 
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for model risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee oversees the 
Company’s model risk management policy, model governance, 
model performance, model issue remediation status, and 
adherence to model risk appetite metrics. 

At the management level, the Model Risk function, which is 

part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for model risk and is 
responsible for governance, validation and monitoring of model 
risk across the Company. The Model Risk function reports to the 
CRO and provides periodic reports related to model risk to the 
Board’s Risk Committee. 

Strategic Risk Management 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, or liquidity arising 
from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of 
strategic initiatives, or inadequate responses to changes in the 
external operating environment. 

The Board has primary oversight responsibility for strategic 

planning and oversees management’s development and 
implementation of and approves the Company’s strategic plan, 
and considers whether it is aligned with the Company’s risk 
appetite and risk management effectiveness. Management 
develops, executes and recommends significant strategic 
corporate transactions and the Board evaluates management’s 
proposals, including their impact on the Company’s risk profile 
and financial position. The Board’s Risk Committee has primary 
oversight responsibility for the Company’s strategic risk and the 
adequacy of the Company’s strategic risk management program, 
including associated risk management practices, processes and 
controls. 

At the management level, the Strategic Risk Oversight 

function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
strategic risk. The Strategic Risk Oversight function reports into 
the CRO and supports periodic reports related to strategic risk 
provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Reputation Risk Management 
Reputation risk is the risk arising from the potential that 
negative stakeholder opinion or negative publicity regarding the 
Company’s business practices, whether true or not, will adversely 
impact current or projected financial conditions and resilience, 
cause a decline in the customer base, or result in costly litigation. 
Key stakeholders include customers, employees, communities, 
shareholders, regulators, elected officials, advocacy groups, and 
media organizations. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for reputation risk, while each Board committee 
has reputation risk oversight responsibilities related to their 
primary oversight responsibilities. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities, the Board’s Risk Committee receives reports 
from management that help it monitor how effectively the 
Company is managing reputation risk. As part of its oversight 
responsibilities for social and public responsibility matters, the 
Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports 
from management relating to stakeholder perceptions of the 
Company. 

At the management level, the Reputation Risk Oversight 
function, which is part of IRM, has oversight responsibility for 
reputation risk. The Reputation Risk Oversight function reports 
into the CRO and supports periodic reports related to reputation 
risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee. 

Credit Risk Management 
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a borrower or 
counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance 
with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of the 
Company’s assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. 

The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight 

responsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 

are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities; and 
• 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality; 
Counterparty credit risk; 
Economic and market conditions; 
Legislative or regulatory mandates; 
Changes in interest rates; 

Reputation risk. 

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate 
considerations into its credit risk management activities. 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability 
by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes 
comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, 
frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive 
credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit 
process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-
controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

Additional information on our loan portfolios and our credit

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Our credit risk monitoring 
process is designed to enable early identification of developing 
risk and to support our determination of an appropriate 
allowance for credit losses. The following discussion provides 
additional characteristics and analysis of our significant 
portfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit 
Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis 
and credit metric information for each of the following 
portfolios. 

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING  
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate 
commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according 
to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We 
generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, 
doubtful, and loss categories. 

We had $14.6 billion of the commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2023, 
compared with $12.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase 
was driven by the technology, telecom and media, and retail 
industries. 

The majority of our commercial and industrial loans and 
lease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as 
long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is 
the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral 
securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of 
repayment. 

The portfolio decreased at December 31, 2023, compared 

with December 31, 2022, as a result of paydowns and decreased 
loan draws. Table 18 provides our commercial and industrial loans 
and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based 
on the North American Industry Classification System.

Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit. Effective first quarter 2023, unfunded credit commitments exclude 
discretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment increase. Prior period balances have been revised to conform with the current period 
presentation. For additional information on issued letters of credit, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

(2)  No other single industry had total loans in excess of $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Table 18a provides further loan segmentation for our largest 
industry category, financials except banks. This category includes 
loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, 
rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment 
banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to 

help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, 
collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of 
collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a 
percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering 
underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

Includes loans for subscription or capital calls and loans to prime brokerage customers and securities firms. 
Includes asset-based lending and leasing, including loans to special purpose entities, loans to commercial leasing entities, structured lending facilities to commercial loan managers, and also includes 
collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form, all of which were rated AA or above, of $7.6 billion and $7.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Includes originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by consumer loans such as auto loans and leases, and credit cards. 
Includes originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by commercial or residential real estate loans. 

Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 
portfolio included non-U.S. loans of $72.9 billion and $79.7 billion 
at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Significant 
industry concentrations of non-U.S. loans at December 31, 2023 
and 2022, respectively, included: 
• 

$40.5 billion and $45.7 billion in the financials except banks 
industry; 
$11.4 billion and $14.1 billion in the banks industry; and 

• 

• 

$2.0 billion and $1.2 billion in the oil, gas and pipelines 
industry. 

Risk mitigation actions, including the restructuring of 

repayment terms, securing collateral or guarantees, and entering 
into extensions, are based on a re-underwriting of the loan and 
our assessment of the borrower’s ability to perform under the 
agreed-upon terms. Extension terms generally range from six to 
thirty-six months and may require that the borrower provide 

Wells Fargo & Company

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management (continued) 

additional economic support in the form of partial repayment, or 
additional collateral or guarantees. In cases where the value of 
collateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to 
repay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside 
repayment guarantee in providing the extension. 

Our ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly 

related to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and 
willingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or 
more frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the 
most current financial information available and is focused on 
various key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and 
current and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s 
reputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us 
based on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with 
the guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength 
is reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk 
rating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance 
for credit losses methodology. 

In considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate 
the collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated 
support of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the 
strength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full 
repayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely 
collection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the 
performance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual 
status. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in 
accordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net 
realizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  Our CRE loan portfolio is 
composed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The 
total CRE loan portfolio decreased $5.2 billion from 
December 31, 2022, as paydowns exceeded originations and 
advances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by 
property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE 
loans are in California, New York, Florida, and Texas, which 
represented a combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The 
largest property type concentrations are apartments at 28% and 
office at 21% of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments at 
December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7.7 billion and $8.8 billion, 
respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and $13.2 billion and 
$20.7 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans. 

We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment 
using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had 
$17.5 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at 
December 31, 2023, compared with $11.3 billion at 
December 31, 2022, and $830 million of CRE construction loans 
classified as criticized at December 31, 2023, compared with 
$1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in criticized CRE 
mortgage loans was predominantly driven by the office and 
apartments property types. The credit quality of the office 
property type continued to be adversely affected as weakened 
demand for office space continued to drive higher vacancy rates 
and deteriorating operating performance. Loans in California and 
New York represented approximately 40% of the office property 
type at December 31, 2023. We continue to closely monitor this 
portfolio.

Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit. For additional information on issued letters of credit, see Note 17 (Guarantees 
and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
Includes 40 states and non-U.S. loans. No state in Other had loans in excess of $4.4 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Non-U.S. loans were $6.9 billion and 
$7.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
In second quarter 2023, we reclassified certain CRE loans to better align with regulatory reporting guidance, which resulted in a decrease in loans outstanding of approximately $2.0 billion to the 
office property type. 

NON-U.S. LOANS  Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on 
whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United 
States. At December 31, 2023, non-U.S. loans totaled 
$80.0 billion, representing approximately 9% of our total 
consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $87.5 billion, or 
approximately 9% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at 
December 31, 2022. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% and 
5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. 

COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  Our country risk monitoring process 
incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, 
legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do 
business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure 
limits for each country through a centralized oversight process 
based on customer needs, and through consideration of the 
relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure 
based on our assessment of a borrower’s ability to repay, 

which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as 
guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the 
reporting based on a borrower’s primary address. 

Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at 

December 31, 2023, was the United Kingdom, which totaled 
$27.8 billion, or approximately 1% of our total assets, and 
included $4.1 billion of sovereign claims. Our United Kingdom 
sovereign claims arise from deposits we have placed with the 
Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support 
of our London branch. 

Table 20 provides information regarding our top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our 
assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of 
any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to 
Table 20: 
• 

Lending and deposits with banks exposure includes 
outstanding loans, unfunded credit commitments (excluding 
discretionary amounts where our approval or consent is 
required prior to any loan funding or commitment increase), 
and deposits with non-U.S. banks. These balances are 
presented prior to the deduction of allowance for credit

Includes sovereign and non-sovereign deposits with banks of $12.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. 
Total non-sovereign exposure consisted of $45.3 billion exposure to financial institutions and $50.6 billion to non-financial corporations at December 31, 2023. 

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS  Our residential mortgage loan 
portfolio is composed of 1–4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans. Residential mortgage – first lien loans represented 96% of 
the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 
2023, compared with 95% at December 31, 2022. 

The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with 

adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a 
result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage 
(ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that 
limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. 
The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. 
ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 
and 2022, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the 
majority of this portfolio at December 31, 2023. We do not offer 
option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage 
products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to 
within the financial services industry as negative amortizing 
mortgage loans. 

The residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of 

residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. 
These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only 
payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar 
features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing 
payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods 
between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit 

performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio 
for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity 
of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan 
is delinquent. 

The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of 
credit was $15.0 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with 
$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded credit 
commitments for these lines of credit totaled $28.6 billion at 
December 31, 2023, compared with $35.5 billion at 
December 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit 
(both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 
or 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options 
available during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% 
of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. The lines 
that enter their amortization period may experience higher 
delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or 
term period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL 
for loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were 
approximately 2% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 and 
2022. 

During the draw period, the borrower has the option of 
converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate 
to a fixed rate. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit 
generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with 
repayment terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time 
of conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a 

36 

Wells Fargo & Company 

 
balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the 
outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The 
conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff 
may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect 
some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. As 
borrowers near the end of their draw period, we work with them 
to transition from interest-only to fully-amortizing payments or 
full repayment. 

We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying 

economic or market conditions for the geographic areas of our 
residential mortgage portfolio as part of our credit risk 
management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio 
includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price 
Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models 
(AVMs) to support property values. AVMs are computer-based 
tools used to estimate the market value of homes. We have 
processes to periodically validate AVMs and specific risk 
management guidelines addressing the circumstances when 
AVMs may be used. For additional information about our use of 
appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.

line of credit amounts). For additional information regarding 
credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist 

homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. Under these programs, we may provide concessions 
such as interest rate reductions, term extensions, forbearance of 
principal, and in some cases, principal forgiveness. These 
programs generally include a trial payment period of three 
months, and after successful completion and compliance with 
terms during this period, the loan is permanently modified. For 
additional information on loan modifications, see Note 5 (Loans 
and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

Residential Mortgage – First Lien Portfolio  Our residential 
mortgage – first lien portfolio decreased $6.2 billion from 
December 31, 2022, due to loan paydowns, partially offset by 
originations. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency,

Credit Card  The increase in the outstanding balance at 
December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was 
primarily due to higher purchase volume and new account 
growth. 

Auto  The decrease in the outstanding balance at December 31,

Certain nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status 

after they perform for a period of time. Consumer credit card 
loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally fully 
charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past due. 

Table 24 summarizes nonperforming assets (NPAs). 

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED 
ASSETS)  We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
• 

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes 
uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; 
they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential 
mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the 
loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; 
part of the principal balance has been charged off; or 
for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the 
related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in 
the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status.

Residential mortgage loans predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are insured or guaranteed. 
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to 
these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government 
guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in accounts receivable in other assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Commercial nonaccrual loans increased $3.1 billion from 
December 31, 2022, driven by an increase in commercial real 
estate nonaccrual loans, predominantly within the office 
property type. For additional information on commercial 
nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk 
Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease 
Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – 
Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report. 

Consumer nonaccrual loans decreased $461 million from 

December 31, 2022, due to lower residential mortgage 
nonaccrual loans.

Table 25 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual 

loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans 

that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities.

We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in 
developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to 
losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors 
at December 31, 2023: 
• 

99% of total commercial nonaccrual loans are secured, 
predominantly by real estate. 
76% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest and 66% of commercial nonaccrual loans were 
current on both principal and interest, but were on 
nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of 
interest or principal had become uncertain.

The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs in 2023, 

 The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into 

compared with 2022, was due to higher losses in all commercial 
portfolios, primarily in our commercial real estate portfolio 
driven by the office property type. 

The increase in consumer net loan charge-offs in 2023, 

compared with 2022, was due to higher losses in all consumer 
portfolios, primarily in our credit card portfolio. 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  We maintain an allowance for 
credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of 
the expected lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair 
value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt 
securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets 
measured at amortized cost, including deposits with banks, net 
investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit 
exposures. 

consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted 
loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-
specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and 
complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit 
metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do 
not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use 
several analytical tools. For additional information on our ACL, 
see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit 
Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. For additional 
information on our ACL for loans, see Note 5 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report, and for additional information on our ACL for debt 
securities, see Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.

portfolio segment and class.

Includes negative allowance for expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off. 

The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for 
loans presented in Table 28 may fluctuate from period to period 
due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, 
borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of 
collateral. 

 The ACL for loans increased $1.5 billion, or 11%, from 

December 31, 2022, reflecting increases for commercial real 
estate loans, primarily office loans, as well as for increases in 
credit card loan balances, partially offset by a decrease for 
residential mortgage loans related to the adoption of ASU 
2022-02. For additional information on ASU 2022-02, see 
Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. The detail of the changes in the ACL 
for loans by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and 
recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 5 (Loans and Related 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our 
estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base 
scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario 
and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans 
at December 31, 2023. The base scenario assumed elevated 
inflation and economic contraction in the near term, reflecting 
declining property values and increased unemployment rates 
from historically low levels. The downside scenarios assumed a 
more substantial economic contraction due to declining property 
values, high inflation, and lower business and consumer 
confidence. 

Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent 

the risk of limitations inherent in our processes and assumptions 
such as economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions 
and performance, and other subjective factors, including industry 
trends and emerging risk assessments. 

The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate 

of the ACL for loans at December 31 and September 30, 2023, 
are presented in Table 29.

Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and 
real GDP), among other factors. 

We believe the ACL for loans of $15.1 billion at 

December 31, 2023, was appropriate to cover expected credit 
losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The 
entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total 
loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects 
existing factors as of the date of determination, including 
economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external 
examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for 
loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is 
possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not 
anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for

(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for additional information about residential and 
commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. 
In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon 
transfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from 
certain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable 
based on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan 
payments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to 
repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding 
liability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to 
repurchase the loan. We may repurchase these loans for cash and 
as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. 

Loans repurchased from GNMA securitization pools that 
regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance 
with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future 
GNMA loan securitization pools. At December 31, 2023 and 
2022, these loans, which we have repurchased or have the 
unilateral option to repurchase, were $7.8 billion and $9.8 billion, 
respectively, which included $7.4 billion and $8.6 billion, 
respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in 
loans held for sale. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information about our involvement with mortgage 
loan securitizations. 

Each agreement under which we act as servicer or master 

servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for 
actions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify 
the securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or 
master servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, 
if we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master 
servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not 
cured within a specified period. The standards governing 
servicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible 
remedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those 
standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides 
maintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and 
individual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs 
from time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification 
or repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in 
connection with our servicing activities, we could continue to 
become subject to consent orders and settlement agreements 
with federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and 
practices. In general, these can require us to provide customers 
with loan modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure 
prevention and assistance, and can result in business restrictions 
or the imposition of certain monetary penalties on us. 

determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES  We sell residential and 
commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1) 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs), Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage 
Association (FNMA), who include the mortgage loans in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private 
label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase 
mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In 
addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential 
mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed 
by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We 
may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify 
the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the 
securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred 
on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of 
contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied 
within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of 
the breach. 

In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 

mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase 
liability, initially at fair value, related to various representations 
and warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for 
loans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or 
not we currently service those loans, based on a combination of 
factors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest 
Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional 
information about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase 
losses. 

We provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage 
loans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms 
of certain programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of 
actual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 
(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements 
in this Report for additional information about our exposure to 
loss related to these programs. 

In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as 
servicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial 
mortgage loans included in GSE mortgage securitizations, 
GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/ 
VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage 
securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by 
institutional investors. 

The loans we service were originated by us or by other 
mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance 
certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the 
mortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or 
primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage 
loans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of 
taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) 
foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent 
consistent with the related servicing agreement, consider 
alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short 
sales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property 
through liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are 
typically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of 
the mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent 
amounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform 
their advancing obligations. The amount and timing of 
reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves measuring, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of the Board, while primary 
oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the Risk 
Committee of the Board. These committees oversee the 
administration and effectiveness of financial risk management 
policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. 

At the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability 
Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management 
from finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and 
supports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance 
Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in 
more detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate 
management level oversight specific to market risk. 

INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market 
fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange 
can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming 
from mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and 
liabilities generally arising from customer-related lending and 
deposit-taking activities. We are subject to interest rate risk 
because: 
• 

assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
or by different amounts; 
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change 
independently or with different magnitudes; 
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may 
shorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or 
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on 
loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination 
volume, and the fair value of financial instruments and 
MSRs. 

• 

• 

• 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing the earnings 
outcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios that differ in the 
direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of 
interest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the 
yield curve. These scenarios require assumptions regarding 
drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan 
originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, 
deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We 
periodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions. 
Our scenario assumptions reflected the following: 
• 

Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our 
assets and liabilities over time. 

•  Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary 

across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or 
lower interest rates. 

• 

•  Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated 
with the changes in interest rates are held constant. 
The funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates 
deposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent 
with the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical 
scenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the 
base scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer 
deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding 
products and/or requires additional market funding could 
reduce the expected benefit from higher rates. 
The interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest 
rates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by 
historical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing 
strategies. Our actual experience may differ from 

• 

expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit 
repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. 

Table 30 presents the results of the estimated net interest 

income sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple 
scenarios compared with our base scenario. The base scenario is a 
reference point used by the Company for financial planning 
purposes. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous 
movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher 
interest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter 
non-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates 
are defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term 
interest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years.

Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect 
to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice 
faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the 
case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward 
and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net 
interest income. The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from 
December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, reflected updates 
for our expected balance sheet composition, including a shift to 
higher cost deposits. The magnitude of the benefit, if any, from 
higher interest rates may vary from our scenarios, including 
because future deposit pricing and balances may be different 
from our current expectations. The realized impact of interest 
rate changes may also vary from our base and hypothetical 
scenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags. 
We use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities 

portfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use 
derivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash 
flows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate 
payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce 
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of 
our AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge 
our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and 
MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures 
are presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of 
AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the 
amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized 
gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS 
to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the 
life of the security with no further impact from interest rate 
changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity 
Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
additional information on our debt securities portfolio.

Wells Fargo & Company 

In addition to the net interest income sensitivity above, we 
also measure and evaluate the economic value sensitivity (EVS) 
of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present value of 
the life-time cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities 
across a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance 
sheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are 
exposed to higher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS 
through a set of limits that are designed to align with our interest 
rate risk appetite. 

Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense 

are impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have 
sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net 
interest income. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Risk” section in this Report for additional information. 

Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted 
by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits 
that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees 
on commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the 
impact to net interest income does not include the fair value 
changes of trading securities, which, along with the effects of 
related economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In 
addition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and 
noninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by 
the actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional 
information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 
(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK  We 
originate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to 
various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity 
risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and 
other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or 
securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage 
loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of 
commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for 
investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability 
management activities. We may also retain securities in our 
investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. 

Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking 
noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and 
the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan 
commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage 
applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our 
mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to 
the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer 
demand, as well as the time required for processing a new 
application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and 
selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend 
on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest 
rates. 

The valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly 
subjective and involve complex judgments by management 
about matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in 
interest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions 
captured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including 
prepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the 
servicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow 
balances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage 
Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional 
information on the valuation of our residential MSRs. 
An increase in interest rates generally reduces the 

propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the 
servicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair 

value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also 
reduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, 
which reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A 
decline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. 
To reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our 
residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of 
derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar 
futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest 
rate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in 
mortgage banking is a complex process that requires 
sophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are 
several potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking 
related to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and 
associated hedging results, the relationship and degree of 
volatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and 
changes in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to 
balance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the 
financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the 
values and income being hedged. 

The size of the hedge and the particular combination of 
hedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce 
the volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a 
range of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the 
composition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the 
relationship between the origination and servicing sides of our 
mortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types 
of instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and 
rebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and 
the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. 

For additional information on mortgage banking, including 

key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see 
Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and 
Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

MARKET RISK  Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss 
from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest 
rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and 
commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to 
counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, 
basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the 
trading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness 
risk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and 
impairment on private equity investments. 

The Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight 
responsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s 
market risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In 
addition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight 
responsibilities with respect to market risk, including 
counterparty risk. The Finance Committee also reports key 
market risk matters to the Risk Committee. 

At the management level, the Market and Counterparty Risk 

Management function, which is part of IRM, has oversight 
responsibility for market risk across the enterprise. The Market 
and Counterparty Risk Management function reports into 
Corporate and Investment Banking Risk and provides periodic 
reports related to market risk to the Board’s Finance Committee 
and Risk Committee, as applicable. 

MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  We engage in trading 
activities to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to 
manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities 
predominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser 
extent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held

Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

for trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and 
trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading 
activities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the 
financial instruments used in our trading activities include net 
interest income, changes in fair value, and realized gains and 
losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is 
reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes 
in fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading 
activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For 
additional information on the financial instruments used in our 
trading activities and the income from these trading activities, 
see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to 
estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial 
markets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with 
sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and 
monitoring market risk. These market risk measures are 
monitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated 
levels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management 
function aggregates and monitors exposures against our 
established risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are 

Table 31:  Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors 
various market risk exposure measures from a variety of 
perspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and 
legal entity. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The 
Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk 
limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on 
our consolidated balance sheet. 

Table 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation 
model which assumes that historical changes in market values 
are representative of the potential future outcomes and 
measures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a 
1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical 
simulation model is based on equally weighted data from a 
12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a 
12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is 
responsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence 
level equates to an expectation that the Company would incur 
single-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on 
average once every 100 trading days.

The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated 
causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on 
different days. 

Sensitivity Analysis  Given the inherent limitations of the VaR 
models, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity 
analysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the 
measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% 
increase in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We 
conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, 
volatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. 
Sensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication 
of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market 
moves. 

Stress Testing  While VaR captures the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, 
stress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to 
extreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios 
estimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions 
of abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit 
spread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These 
scenarios assume that the market moves happen 
instantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes 
place to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative 
approach since experience demonstrates otherwise). 

An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both 

historical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad 
range of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation 
and differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the 
impact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio 
values. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase 
across the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. 
Historical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress 
scenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis 
addresses how these events might affect the risk factors 
relevant to a portfolio. 

The Company’s stress testing framework is also used in 
calculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal 
stress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated 
to address potential market events or concerns. For more detail 
on the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in 
this Report. 

MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES  We are directly and indirectly 
affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage 
equity investments in various businesses, such as start-up 
companies and emerging growth companies. We also invest in 

46 

Wells Fargo & Company 

funds that make similar private equity investments. These 
private equity investments are made within capital allocations 
approved by management and the Board. The Board reviews 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly to 
assess them for impairment and observable price changes. For 
nonmarketable equity securities, the analysis is based on facts 
and circumstances of each individual investment and the 
expectations for that investment’s cash flows, capital needs, the 
viability of its business model, our exit strategy, and observable 
price changes that are similar to the investments held. 
Investments in nonmarketable equity securities include private 
equity investments accounted for under the equity method, fair 
value through net income, and the measurement alternative. 

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 
public equities, listed/over-the-counter equity derivatives, and 
convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these 
activities. We also have marketable equity securities that include 
investments relating to our venture capital activities. We manage 
these marketable equity securities within capital risk limits 
approved by management and the Board and monitored by 
Corporate ALCO and the Market Risk Committee. The fair value 
changes in these marketable equity securities are recognized in 
net income. For additional information, see Note 4 (Equity 
Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING  Liquidity risk is the risk arising from 
the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they 
come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without 
incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we 
enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash 
payments, including funding for customer loan requests, 
customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, 
leases for premises and equipment, and other cash 
commitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of 
deposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-
operational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to be able to meet our contractual obligations 
and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal 
operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific 
and/or market stress. For additional information on these 
obligations, see the following sections and Notes to Financial 
Statements in this Report:

To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity 

guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover 
potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence 
on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are 
monitored on a monthly basis by the management-level 
Corporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by 
the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for 
both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that 
the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. 

Liquidity Stress Tests  Liquidity stress tests are performed to 
help the Company maintain sufficient liquidity to meet 
contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of 
stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as  
idiosyncratic events, including a range of stress conditions and 
time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of the 
Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and inform 
future needs in the Company’s funding plan. 

Contingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP), 
which is approved by the Corporate Asset/Liability Committee 
and the Board’s Risk Committee, sets out the Company’s 
strategies and action plans to address potential liquidity needs 
during market-wide or idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP 
establishes measures for monitoring emerging liquidity events 
and describes the processes for communicating and managing 
stress events should they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate 
funding and liquidity strategies available to the Company in a 
period of stress. 

Liquidity Standards  We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, 
OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity 
requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold 
high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists 
of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and 
mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies 
to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) 
with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued 
by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as 
Wells Fargo. 

We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and 
FDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the 
net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking 
organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum 
amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term 
debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, 
derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon 
period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with 
total assets of $10 billion or more. As of December 31, 2023, we 
were compliant with the NSFR requirement.

Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and 
unfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors, including the type of customer and the nature of the account. 

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, 
interest-earning deposits with banks, and unencumbered high-
quality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary 
sources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are 
substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR 
rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally 

exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable 
haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our 
subsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule. Our primary sources 
of liquidity are presented in Table 33 at fair value, which also 
includes encumbered securities that are not included as available 
HQLA in the calculation of the LCR.

Our interest-earning deposits with banks are mainly on 
deposit with the Federal Reserve. We believe the debt securities 
included in Table 33 provide quick and reliable sources of liquidity 
through sales or by pledging to obtain financing, regardless of 
market conditions. Debt securities within our HTM portfolio are 
not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain financing. 

As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 

$485.8 billion of available borrowing capacity at various Federal 
Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window, 
based on collateral pledged. Although available, we do not view 
this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity. 

In addition, liquidity is also available through the sale or 
financing of other debt securities, including trading and/or AFS 
debt securities, as well as through the sale, securitization, or 
financing of loans, to the extent such debt securities and loans 
are not encumbered. 

Funding Sources  The Parent acts as a source of funding for the 
Company through the issuance of long-term debt and equity. 
WFC Holdings, LLC (the “IHC”) is an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent, which provides funding 
support for the ongoing operational requirements of the Parent 

and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For additional 
information on the IHC, see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living 
Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this Report. 
Additional subsidiary funding is provided by deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of 
relatively low-cost funds. Loans were 69% of total deposits at 
both December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Table 34 presents a summary of our short-term borrowings, 

which generally mature in less than 30 days. The balances of 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase may vary over time due to client activity, our own 
demand for financing, and our overall mix of liabilities. For 
additional information on the classification of our short-term 
borrowings, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting 
Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. We pledge 
certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize 
repurchase agreements and other securities financings. For 
additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of 
Note 19 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements 
in this Report.

securities, private placements and asset-backed secured funding. 
We issue long-term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies 
to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate 
maturity profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for 
general corporate purposes unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, and we expect 
the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for 
the same purposes. Depending on market conditions and our

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 
On October 2, 2023, S&P Global Ratings affirmed the 
Company’s ratings and maintained the stable outlook. On 
October 23, 2023, Moody’s affirmed the Company’s ratings and 
retained the stable outlook. On November 13, 2023, Moody’s 
affirmed the ratings for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. but changed the 
outlook to negative from stable for long-term bank deposits, 
long-term issuer ratings, and senior unsecured debt. 

Table 36:  Credit Ratings as of December 31, 2023 

Moody’s 

S&P Global Ratings 

Fitch Ratings 

DBRS Morningstar 

Moody’s indicated that the outlook change reflected their view 
of the potentially weaker capacity of the U.S government to 
support systemically important banks in the U.S., as reflected in 
Moody’s recent change in the outlook on the U.S. government to 
negative from stable. There were no other actions undertaken by 
the rating agencies with regard to our credit ratings during 
fourth quarter 2023. 

See the “Risk Factors” section in this Report for additional 
information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact 
a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and 
operations as well as Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for information regarding additional 
collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative 
instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below 
investment grade.

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market 
expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the 
retention of earnings net of both dividends and share 
repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock 
and long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at 
December 31, 2023, increased $13.2 billion from December 31, 
2022, predominantly as a result of $19.1 billion of Wells Fargo 
net income, partially offset by $6.0 billion of common and 
preferred stock dividends. During 2023, we issued $1.6 billion of 
common stock, substantially all of which was issued in 
connection with employee compensation and benefits. In 2023, 
we repurchased 272 million shares of common stock at a cost of 
$12.0 billion. For additional information about capital planning, 
see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section below. 
In 2023, we issued $1.725 billion of our Preferred Stock, 
Series EE, and redeemed all of our Preferred Stock, Series Q. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted 
ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. 

RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  The Company 
is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to 
implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking 
organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating 
capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced 
Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, 
and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both 
approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based 
capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital 
distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 

On July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a 
proposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, 
which would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain 
banks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced 
Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based 
approach for the measurement of risk-weighted assets, including 
more granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk 
framework, and a new standardized approach for measuring 
operational risk. The new requirements would be phased in over a 
three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects 
a significant increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net 
increase in its capital requirements based on an assessment of 
the proposed rule. The Company is considering a range of 
potential actions to address the impact of the proposed rule, 
including balance sheet and capital optimization strategies. 
Table 37 and Table 38 present the risk-based capital 

requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized 
Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2023.

Capital conservation buffer 

In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described 
in Table 37 and Table 38, if the FRB determines that a period of 
excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the 
risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking 
regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at December 31, 
2023, was 0.00%. 

The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain 
institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach 
and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or 
financial stress. 

The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease 

in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse 
scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four 
quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress 
capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ 
over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based 
capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are 
subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for 
the period October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024, is 
2.90%. 

50 

Wells Fargo & Company 

As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also 

subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital 
surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio 
requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually 
calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher 
of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers 
our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the 
methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar 
inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term 
wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is 
calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the 
amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If 
our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital 
surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our 
annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital 

Table 39:  Capital Components and Ratios 

surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our 
G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2024. On 
July 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact 
the methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge. 
Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets 

and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance 
sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories 
according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the 
nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk 
category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with 
that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the 
risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-
weighted assets (RWAs). 

The tables that follow provide information about our risk-

based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III 
capital rules. Table 39 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, total 
capital, RWAs and capital ratios.

In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12. We adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and 
certain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. 
In third quarter 2023, we sold investments in certain private equity funds. As a result, we have removed the related goodwill and other intangible assets on investments in consolidated portfolio 
companies. 
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at 
period-end. 
In second quarter 2020, the Company elected to apply a modified transition provision issued by federal banking regulators related to the impact of the current expected credit loss accounting 
standard (CECL) on regulatory capital. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25% of the cumulative changes in the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL) under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the benefit is reduced by 25% in year one, 50% in year two 
and 75% in year three. 
Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of 
qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 
1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs.

RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. The  
Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

Capital Management (continued) 

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY  We also evaluate our business based 
on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible 
common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents 
total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, 
goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) 
and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in 
consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred 
taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, 
which represents tangible common equity divided by common 
shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common 

equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of 
determining tangible common equity may differ among 
companies. Management believes that tangible book value per 
common share and return on average tangible common equity, 
which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial 
measures because they enable management, investors, and 
others to assess the Company’s use of equity. 

Table 43 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS  As a BHC, we are required to maintain 
a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and 
maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 44 presents the 
leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of 
December 31, 2023.

In August 2023, the FRB proposed rules that would, among 

other things, modify the calculation of eligible long-term debt 
that counts towards the TLAC requirements, which would reduce 
our TLAC ratios. 

Table 45 presents information regarding the calculation and

The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, excluding 
goodwill and certain other items as determined under the rule. 

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY  As a G-SIB, we are required to 
have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to 
as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required
to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital 
and additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or 
covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid 
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 
payments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured 
long-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum 
TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of 
December 31, 2023, are presented in Table 46.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS  For 
information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III 
LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability 
Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” 
section in this Report. 

Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo 

Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are 
subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital 
requirements. As of December 31, 2023, these broker-dealer 
subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory 
minimum net capital requirements. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the 
stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory 
requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, 
changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our 
long-term target capital levels are set above their respective 
regulatory minimums plus buffers. 

The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and 
other requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall 
financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs 
when evaluating their capital plans. 

As part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory 
stress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as 
required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of 
capital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s 
proposed capital actions. 

Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and 
banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the 
institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during 
periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.

Securities Repurchases 
On July 25, 2023 we announced that our Board authorized a 
common stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. Unless 
modified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not 
expire and is our only common stock repurchase program in 
effect. At December 31, 2023, we had remaining Board authority 
to repurchase up to approximately $26.7 billion of common 
stock. 

including regulatory requirements under the FRB’s capital plan 
rule. Although we announce when the Board authorizes a share 
repurchase program, we typically do not give any public notice 
before we repurchase our shares. Due to the various factors that 
may impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases and 
the fact that we may be in the market throughout the year, our 
share repurchases occur at various prices. We may suspend share 
repurchase activity at any time. 

Various factors impact the amount and timing of our share 

Furthermore, the Company has a variety of benefit plans in 

repurchases, including the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance 
sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements 
and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of 
supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading 
price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, 

which employees may own or obtain shares of our common 
stock. The Company may buy shares from these plans to 
accommodate employee preferences and these purchases are 
subtracted from our repurchase authority. 

For additional information about share repurchases during 
fourth quarter 2023, see Part II, Item 5 in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Matters 

The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant 
regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation 
and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services 
companies conduct business and may continue to result in 
increased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights 
the more significant regulations and regulatory oversight 
initiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For 
additional information about the regulatory matters discussed 
below and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, 
see Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2023 Form 
10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-
Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 26 
(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Dodd-Frank Act 
The Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform 
legislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional 
information on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its 
rulemaking initiatives. 
• 

Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important 
firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal 
banking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and 
regulatory requirements for systemically important firms. 
The FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing 
enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding 
companies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based 
capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single 
counterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity 
limits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave 
threat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB 
and OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress 
testing requirements for large BHCs and national banks. 
Furthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and 
the financial and operational resilience of its operations, the 
FRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of 
directors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, 
has finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance 
and risk management standards for large national banks 
such as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require 
covered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk 
governance framework to manage and control their risk-
taking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and 
responsibilities for risk management practices within 
covered banks and create certain risk oversight 
responsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to 

• 

• 

the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory 
requirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-
Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight 
Council and the Office of Financial Research, which may 
recommend new systemic risk management requirements 
and require new reporting of systemic risks. 
Regulation of consumer financial products.  The Dodd-Frank 
Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate 
disclosures regarding financial products and are protected 
from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has 
issued and proposed a number of rules impacting consumer 
financial products, including rules impacting residential 
mortgage lending, credit cards, and other financial products 
and banking related activities, as well as the fees that may be 
charged for certain banking products and services. In 
addition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is 
continuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of 
the financial services industry with respect to a number of 
consumer businesses and products, including mortgage 
lending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto 
finance. 
Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities.  The 
Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for 
regulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to 
authority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive 
sets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, 
respectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared 
swaps and security-based swaps. As a registered swap dealer 
and a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, 
as well as others adopted or under consideration by 
regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may 
negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter 
derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new 
derivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may 
increase our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based 
swaps, and other derivatives activities. 

Regulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements 
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the 
FRB and the OCC. For example, the Company is subject to rules 

56 

Wells Fargo & Company 

issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-
based capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The 
Company and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified 
leverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the 
Company is required to have a minimum amount of total loss 
absorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. 
Federal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a 
liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For 
additional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage 
and liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable 
to us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – 
Liquidity Standards” sections in this Report. 

“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as 
“living wills,” designed to facilitate their rapid and orderly 
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. 
Under the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a 
reorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable 
period of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the 
risk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the 
financial stability of the United States. In addition to the 
Company’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare 
and periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
determine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may 
impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements 
on us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we 
adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC 
ultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any 
deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or 
operations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent 
resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. 

If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for 
the appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically 
important financial institution that is in default or in danger of 
default if, among other things, the resolution of the institution 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse 
effects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is 
appointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation 
authority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would 
determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and 
obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation 
authority requires that security holders of a company in 
receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to 
any losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of 
creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the 
strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims 
procedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ 
claims. 

 The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the 
only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, 
whether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the 

FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has 
announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a 
desirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly 
liquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might 
exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is 
possible. 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important 
financial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal 
banking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, 
maintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to 
absorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal 
banking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the 
continued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding 
the failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on 
parent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging 
institutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital 
and liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an 
orderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, 
2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended 
and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with 
WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and 
subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo 
Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC 
(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated 
from time to time as material entities for resolution planning 
purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time 
as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related 
Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including 
the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and 
intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its 
subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will 
continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time 
to time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, 
the IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide 
capital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered 
Entities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support 
Agreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the 
Parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of 
credit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected 
to provide the Parent, during business as usual operating 
conditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its 
debts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other 
obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these 
arrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ 
or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s 
board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the 
committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to 
pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which 
could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and 
its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could 
result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the 
Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if 
the Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective 
obligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, 
the Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant 
to a related security agreement. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a 
range of options that we may consider during times of 
idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial 
weaknesses and restore market confidence without 
extraordinary government support. Recovery options include the 

Wells Fargo & Company 

57 

Regulatory Matters (continued) 

possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, securities, loan 
portfolios or businesses. The Bank must also prepare and 
periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the 
Bank’s plan to remain a going concern when the Bank is 
experiencing considerable financial or operational stress, but has 
not yet deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution 
is imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determines that our 
recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines, restrictions on 
our business or ultimately require us to divest assets.

Other Regulatory Related Matters 
• 

Regulatory actions.  The Company is subject to a number of 
consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may 
require the Company, among other things, to undertake 
certain changes to its business, operations, products and 
services, and risk management practices, and include the 
following: 
◦ 

Consent Orders Discussed in the “Overview” Section in this 
Report.  For a discussion of certain consent orders 
applicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section 
in this Report. 

◦  OCC approval of director and senior executive officer 

appointments and certain post-termination payments.  
Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements 
that were originally imposed in November 2016 to 
provide prior written notice to, and obtain non-
objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in 
directors and senior executive officers, and remains 
subject to certain regulatory limitations on post-
termination payments to certain individuals and 
employees. 

Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change.  
Federal, state, and non-U.S. governments and government 
agencies have demonstrated increased attention to the 
impacts and potential risks associated with climate change. 
For example, federal banking regulators are reviewing the 
implications of climate change on the financial stability of 
the United States and have issued guidance on the 
identification and management by large banks of climate-
related financial risks. In addition, the SEC has proposed 
rules that would require public companies to disclose certain 
climate-related information, including greenhouse gas 
emissions, climate-related targets and goals, and 
governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk 
management processes. Similarly, California’s state 
legislature finalized climate-related disclosure laws, while 
the European Union finalized its Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive. The approaches taken by various 
governments and government agencies can vary 
significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any 
current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to 
climate change and its impacts could require us to change 
certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and 
earnings, impose additional costs on us, subject us to legal or 
regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our 
business operations and/or competitive position.

Wells Fargo & Company 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Six of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; 
income taxes; 
liability for legal actions; and 
goodwill impairment. 

Management has discussed these critical accounting policies 
and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit 
Committee. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which 
is management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the 
loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance 
sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments 
carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an 
ACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other 
financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in 
leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For 
additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

For loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured 

based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset 
(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as 
appropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options 
using historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted 
information. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a 
discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference 
between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. 

Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision 

for credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the 
judgment and review required to determine the ACL, 
management considerations include the evaluation of past 
events, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and 
conditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the 
initial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to 
time, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business or 
investment strategy, or products or product mix may result in a 
corresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our 
methodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial 
asset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio 
segments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available 
to absorb credit losses of the Company. 
Judgment is specifically applied in: 
Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast 
period.  We forecast a wide range of economic variables to 
estimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables 
include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, 
and collateral asset prices. While many of these economic 

• 

variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some 
economic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, 
for example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for 
unemployment rates, home prices and commercial real 
estate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the 
initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period 
to two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast 
multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base 
scenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more 
pessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises 
judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios 
that are used to estimate future credit losses. 
Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term 
average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the 
long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the 
forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages 
are based on observations over multiple economic cycles. 
The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is 
assessed on a quarterly basis. 
Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, 
unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually 
assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit 
variables in our modeled approaches to help assess 
probability of default and loss given default. Borrower 
quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial 
strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default 
curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted 
collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted 
severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk 
ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers 
and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk 
specialists. 
Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally 
developed models that incorporate credit attributes and 
economic variables to generate credit loss estimates. 
Management uses judgment and quantitative analytics in 
the determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and 
variables that are leveraged in the models. These models are 
independently validated in accordance with the Company’s 
policies. We routinely assess our model performance and 
apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy 
of loss estimation. We also assess our models for limitations 
against the company-wide risk inventory to help 
appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our 
estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as 
needed. 
Valuation of collateral.  The current fair value of collateral is 
utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial 
asset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply 
judgment when valuing the collateral either through 
appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or 
other quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral 
valuations support incremental ACL or charge-downs and 
increases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a 
negative allowance when the financial asset has been 
previously written-down below current recovery value. 
Contractual term considerations.  The remaining contractual 
term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and 
certain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We 
extend the contractual term when we are not able to 
unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension 
options. Credit card loans have indeterminate maturities, 

•

• 

• 

• 

Wells Fargo & Company 

59 

Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

which requires that we determine a contractual life by 
estimating the application of future payments to the 
outstanding loan amount. 

•  Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in 
the loss models.  These amounts represent management’s 
judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions 
used in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic 
environmental factors, modeling assumptions and 
performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, 
including industry trends and emerging risk assessments. 

Sensitivity  The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions which requires significant management judgment. 
Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of 
factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, 
and general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted 
economic variables used could have varying impacts on different 
financial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous 
credit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables 
such as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which 
may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in 
opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. 

Our sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s 

view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We 
applied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our 
sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic 
deterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the 
duration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables 
within the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a 
hypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately 
$6.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The hypothetical increase in 
our ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of 
management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the 
current ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative 
effect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar 
sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities 

and other financial assets given its size relative to the overall 
ACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for 
loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. 

Valuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights 
(MSRs) 
MSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage 
loans for others. We generally recognize MSRs when we retain 
servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of 
loans we originate. We carry our MSRs related to residential 
mortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential 
MSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential 
MSRs are reflected in earnings. 

We use models to estimate the fair value of our residential 

MSRs. The models are independently validated in accordance 
with Company policies. Collectively, the models are used to 
calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing 
income and incorporate inputs and assumptions that market 
participants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs 
and assumptions generally are not observable in the market and 
require judgment to determine. If observable market indications 
do become available, these are factored into the estimates as 
appropriate. Significant inputs and assumptions requiring 
management judgement include: 
• 

The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future 
net servicing income.  The prepayment rate is the annual rate 
at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage 
loan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower 

• 

• 

defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and 
borrower defaults which are influenced by changes in 
mortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. 
The discount rate used to present value estimated future net 
servicing income.  The discount rate is the required rate of 
return investors in the market would expect for an asset 
with similar risk and is estimated using a dynamic 
methodology for market curves and volatility. To determine 
the discount rate, we consider the risk premium for 
uncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from 
servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future 
servicing costs and earnings on escrow accounts). 
The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net 
servicing income.  The cost to service loans includes 
estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency 
and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of 
defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service 
loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market 
participant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our 
actual costs may vary from that estimate. 

Both prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, 

and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and 
mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in 
either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results 
in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in 
either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of 
the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-
driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount 
rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the 
future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in 
servicing standards as well as changes in individual state 
foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant 
information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an 
impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation 
in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value 
estimate to independent appraisals. 

For a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, 
see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 
(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets 
and Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest 
Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a 
financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. 

We use fair value measurements to comply with both 

recognition and disclosure requirements. For example, assets and 
liabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, 
AFS debt securities, and derivatives are recorded at fair value on 
our consolidated balance sheet each period. Other financial 
instruments, such as loans held for investment and substantially 
all nonmarketable equity securities are not recorded at fair value 
each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments 
through the application of an accounting method such as lower 
of cost or fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of individual assets, 
or application of the measurement alternative for certain 
nonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our estimate 
of fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, 
such as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-
term debt. 

Disclosure of fair value measurements for assets and 

liabilities are made using a three-level hierarchy. The 

60 

Wells Fargo & Company 

classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based 
on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for 
measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs 
reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained 
from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our 
estimates about market data. 

When developing fair value measurements, we maximize the 

use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to 
measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not 
available, fair value measurement is based upon models that 
generally use market-based or independently sourced market 
parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment 
rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when 
observable market data is limited or not available, fair value 
estimates are typically determined using internal models based 
on unobservable inputs. These models are independently 
validated in accordance with the Company’s policies. Additionally, 
we obtain pricing information from third-party vendors to record 
fair values and to corroborate internal prices. Third-party 
validation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of 
prices received. 

When using internal models based on unobservable inputs, 

management judgment is necessary as we make judgments 
about significant assumptions that market participants would 
use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions 
includes consideration of many factors, including market 
conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, 
such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in 
secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and 
reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine 
fair value. In such cases, adjustments to available quoted prices or 
observable market data may be required. For example, we may 
adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using 
internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact 
of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair 
value measurement. 

We continually assess the level and volume of market 
activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining 
adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions 
can change over time, our determination of which securities 
markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we 
determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted 
prices require adjustment may also change. 

Significant judgment is also applied in the determination of 

whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this 
judgment, we consider available information, including 
observable market data, indications of market liquidity and 
orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques 
and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The 
classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts 
and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category 
and judgments are made regarding the significance of 
unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value 
measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are 
considered significant to the fair value measurement, the 
instrument is classified as Level 3.

value on a recurring basis and (ii) Level 3 assets and liabilities

Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on 
our fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement 
techniques and the impact to our financial statements. 

Income Taxes 
We file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we 
operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: 
current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax 
expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded 
for the current period and includes income tax expense related to 
uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that 
management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of 
realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our 
realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. 

Deferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet 
method and deferred income tax expense results from changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the 
balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is 
based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and 
tax basis of assets and liabilities and recognizes enacted changes 
in income tax rates and laws in the period in which they 
occur. Deferred tax assets, including those related to net 
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, are recognized 
subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely 
than not. When necessary, valuation allowances are established 
to reduce deferred tax assets to the realizable amounts. 

The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

are complex and subject to different interpretations by 
management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In 
establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make 
judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax 
laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future 
certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax 
jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review 
during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise 
over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these 
disputes during the tax examination and audit process and 
ultimately through the court systems when applicable. 

We monitor relevant tax authorities and may update our 

estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax 
laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory 
authorities on a quarterly basis. Updates to our estimate of 
accrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax 
planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. 
Such updates to our estimates may be material to our operating 
results for any given quarter.

Critical Accounting Policies (continued) 

See Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes 
and related income tax assets and liabilities. 

Liability for Legal Actions 
The Company is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, 
governmental, arbitration and other proceedings or 
investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of its 
business activities, and many of those proceedings and 
investigations expose the Company to potential financial loss or 
other adverse consequences. We establish accruals for legal 
actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For 
such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best 
estimate within a range of potential losses that are both 
probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best 
estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those 
potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may 
be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for 
those actions. 

We apply judgment when establishing an accrual for 

potential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing 
the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. 
Our judgment in establishing accruals and the range of 
reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for 
probable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding 
of information currently available related to the legal evaluation 
and potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on 
these matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and 
senior management. These matters may be in various stages of 
investigation, discovery or proceedings. They may also involve a 
wide variety of claims across our businesses, legal entities and 
jurisdictions. The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was 
not considered or was considered remote in anticipated 
occurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will 
change over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. 

The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject 

to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to 
determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also 
inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there 
may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably 
possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses 
may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of 
reasonably possible loss. 

See Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this 

Report for additional information. 

Goodwill Impairment 
We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or 
more frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors 
warrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-
term interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue 
generating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by 
regulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in 
market capitalization. 

We identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill 

impairment at the reportable operating segment level or one 
level below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as 
allocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible 
assets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-
sensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital 
requirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units 

based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using 
both an income approach and a market approach which are 
intended to reflect Company performance and expectations as 
well as external market conditions. The methodologies for 
calculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are 
periodically assessed by senior management and updated as 
necessary. 

The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) 
analysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows 
associated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires 
significant judgment to model financial forecasts for our 
reporting units, which includes future expectations of economic 
conditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations 
related to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed 
by senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, 
we incorporate a terminal value estimate. We discount these 
forecasted cash flows using a consistent rate derived from the 
capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of 
equity for our reporting units, reflecting risks and uncertainties in 
the financial markets and in our internally generated business 
projections. 

The market approach utilizes observable market data from 

comparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings 
or price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting 
unit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a 
control premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical 
acquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in 
the selection of comparable companies and includes those with 
the most similar business activities. 

The aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our 

market capitalization for our fourth quarter 2023 assessment. 
Factors that we believe contributed to this difference included an 
overall premium that would be paid to gain control of the 
operating and financial decisions of the Company, as well as 
short-term market volatility and other factors that may not be 
reflected consistently between the Company’s market 
capitalization and the fair value of individual reporting units. 

Based on our fourth quarter 2023 assessment, there was no 
impairment of goodwill at December 31, 2023. The fair values of 
each reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by 
substantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer 
Lending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer 
Lending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more 
than 10%, it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation 
assumptions. We plan to continue the execution of our more 
focused strategy for the home lending business in the near-term. 
The credit card business has forecasted higher loan balances 
driven by growth from new products and services. Significant 
changes to these plans or forecasts or a significant increase in the 
discount rate could result in an impairment for the Consumer 
Lending reporting unit. The amount of goodwill assigned to the 
Consumer Lending reporting unit was $7.1 billion at 
December 31, 2023. 

Declines in our ability to generate revenue, significant 
increases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions 
from regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill 
impairment of any reporting unit in a future period. 

For additional information on goodwill and our reportable 

operating segments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies), Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other 
Assets), and Note 20 (Operating Segments) to Financial 
Statements in this Report.

Current Accounting Developments 

Table 49 provides the significant accounting updates applicable 
to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective. 

Table 49:  Current Accounting Developments – Issued Standards 

Description and Effective Date 

Financial statement impact 
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-02 – Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method 
The Update, effective January 1, 2024, 
expands the use of the proportional 
amortization method of accounting for 
tax credit investments. Upon adoption, 
the Update permits entities to elect to 
account for equity investments that 
generate income tax credits and benefits 
using the proportional amortization 
method if certain eligibility criteria are 
met. 

We adopted the Update on January 1, 2024, on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect 
adjustment to retained earnings. Upon adoption, we elected to account for eligible investments in our 
renewable energy tax credit portfolio using the proportional amortization method. These investments 
were previously accounted for using the equity method. We also elected to continue use of the 
proportional amortization method to account for our low-income housing tax credit investments. Under 
the proportional amortization method, the cost of a tax credit investment is amortized in proportion to 
the income tax credits and benefits received by the investor, with both amortization and the related 
income tax credits and benefits recorded on a net basis within income tax expense. 

We recorded the impact of this accounting change to the opening balance sheet as of January 1, 2024, as 
an increase to total assets and total liabilities of approximately $2 billion. The adoption impact on 
retained earnings was insignificant. Prior periods were not impacted. 

ASU 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 

The Update, effective December 31, 
2024 (with early adoption permitted), 
enhances reportable segment disclosure 
requirements, primarily through 
enhanced disclosures related to 
significant segment expenses and 
additional interim disclosure 
requirements. 

The Update impacts disclosure only, and therefore does not have an impact on our consolidated financial 
statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Update to our operating segment disclosures. 
The following aspects of the Update may result in disclosure changes: 

• 

• 

• 

Requirement to disclose significant segment expenses by reportable segment if they are regularly 
provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in the reported measure of 
segment profit or loss. 
Requirement to disclose an amount for “other segment items” by reportable segment and provide a 
description of its composition; other segment items is measured as the difference between 
reported segment revenues less the significant segment expenses disclosed in accordance with the 
principle described above and reported segment profit or loss. 
Requirement to disclose the CODM’s title and position and explain how the CODM uses the 
reported segment profit or loss measure in assessing segment performance and deciding how to 
allocate resources. 

ASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 

The Update, effective January 1, 2025 
(with early adoption permitted), 
enhances annual income tax disclosures 
primarily to further disaggregate 
existing disclosures related to the 
effective income tax rate reconciliation 
and income taxes paid. 

The impact of the Update is limited to our annual income tax disclosures. We are currently evaluating the 
impact of the Update to our income tax disclosures. Upon adoption, those disclosures may change as 
follows: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

For the tabular effective income tax rate reconciliation, alignment to specific categories (where 
applicable) and further disaggregation of certain categories (where applicable) by nature and/or 
jurisdiction if the reconciling item is 5% or more of the statutory tax expense. 
Description of states and local jurisdictions that contribute the majority of the effect of the state 
and local income tax category of the effective income tax rate reconciliation. 
Disaggregate the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds) by federal, state, and non-U.S. taxes 
and further disaggregate by individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid (net of refunds) is 5% 
or more of total income taxes paid (net of refunds). 
Disaggregate net income (or loss) before income tax expense (or benefit) between domestic and 
non-U.S. 

Other Accounting Developments 
The following Updates are applicable to us but are not expected 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements:

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, 
we may make forward-looking statements in our other 
documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and our management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the 
media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified 
by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” 
“believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” 
“forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar 
references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make 
about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the 
Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our 
expectations regarding noninterest expense and our efficiency 
ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our 
expectations regarding future loan losses, our allowance for 
credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to develop 
the allowance; (iv) our expectations regarding net interest 
income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction 
or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or 
liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) our expectations regarding 
our mortgage business and any related commitments or 
exposures; (viii) the expected outcome and impact of legal, 
regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (ix) future 
common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other 
uses of capital; (x) our targeted range for return on assets, return 
on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xi) 
expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xii) the 
outcome of contingencies, such as legal actions; (xiii) 
environmental, social and governance related goals or 
commitments; and (xiv) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical 

facts but instead represent our current expectations and 
assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other 
future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to 
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and 
changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by the 
forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against 
relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are 
neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or 
assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance 
that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those in the forward-looking statements include 
the following, without limitation: 
• 

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate 
prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical 
matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that 
could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, 
including rules and regulations relating to bank products and 
financial services;

our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as 
part of our expense management initiatives, including as a 
result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, 
changes in our business composition and operating 
environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, 
and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our 
assets or liabilities on our net interest income, net interest 
margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing 
rights and mortgage loans held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairment of 
securities held in our debt securities and equity securities 
portfolios; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage 
and wealth management businesses; 
developments in our mortgage banking business, including 
any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing, loan 
modification or foreclosure practices, and any changes in 
industry standards, regulatory or judicial requirements, or 
our strategic plans for the business; 
negative effects from instances where customers may have 
experienced financial harm, including on our legal, 
operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our 
ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our 
reputation; 
regulatory matters, including the failure to resolve 
outstanding matters on a timely basis and the potential 
impact of new matters, litigation, or other legal actions, 
which may result in, among other things, additional costs, 
fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or 
other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
changes to tax laws, regulations, and guidance as well as the 
effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate; 
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans 
and strategies; and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in this Report. 

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance 
sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements 
and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of 
supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading 
price of our stock), regulatory and legal considerations, including 

Wells Fargo & Company 

regulatory requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s 
capital plan rule, and other factors deemed relevant by the 
Company, and may be subject to regulatory approval or 
conditions. 

For additional information about factors that could cause 
actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to 
our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this Report, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov.1 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as 

of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could 
cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, 
and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake 
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to 
time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP 
financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets 
for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to 
provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial 
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measures because we are unable to provide, without 
unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or 
estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the 
reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in 
forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may 
occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future 
results.

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall 
substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the 
investment could be reduced or eliminated. We discuss below 
risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and 
condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the 
Company. 

ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND 
LIQUIDITY RISKS 

Our financial results have been, and will continue to be, 
materially affected by general economic conditions, and a 
deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial 
markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other 
businesses and our financial results and condition.  We 
generate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the 
loans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial 
amount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest 
income and fee income that we earn from our consumer and 
commercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses 
have been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the 
state of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and 
home prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty 
stemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, 
including concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes, 
and U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact 
the global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including 
international political unrest or disturbances, wars, and terrorist 
activities, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, 
restrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory 
measures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the 
stability of financial markets and the global economy. Any 
impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the 
U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global 
economy or any deterioration in general economic conditions 
and/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or 
any other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. 
or global economy, could materially adversely affect our 
financial results and condition. 

A weakening in business or economic conditions, including 
higher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as 
higher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ 
ability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can 
increase our credit losses. If unemployment levels worsen or if 
home prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs 
and provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit 
losses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer 
loan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially 
for those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries 
that may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The 
ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may 
deteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE 
lenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In 
addition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it 
more challenging for us to increase our consumer and 
commercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy 
borrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic 
conditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest 
rates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our 
retaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on 
our consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions worsen 

and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a 
decrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the 
demand for our products, including our consumer and 
commercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest 
income and our earnings. 

A deterioration in business and economic conditions, which 

may erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or 
increased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely 
affect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our 
investment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, 
markets and investment banking businesses. For example, 
because investment advisory fees are often based on the value of 
assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those 
assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market 
prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing 
commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage 
business. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively 
affect the performance of products we have provided to 
customers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional 
costs. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial 
markets also can negatively affect our debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture 
capital business and trading activities, including through 
increased counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global 
financial markets and economies, including as a result of any 
geopolitical matters or unrest, may adversely affect the revenue 
and earnings of our international operations, particularly our 
global financial institution and correspondent banking services. 
For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” 
sections in this Report. 

Changes in interest rates and financial market values could 
reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our 
other comprehensive income, including as a result of 
recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we 
hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.  Changes in 
either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning 
assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the 
February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net 
interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can 
affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our 
assets and the funding costs of our liabilities tend to move in the 
same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can 
rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin 
to expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the 
yield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets 
falls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin tends 
to contract. 

The amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect 
our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the 
form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. 
As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower 
demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield 
and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and 
net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged 
period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower 
yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, 
particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher 
yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. A prolonged 
period of high interest rates, however, may continue to 
negatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit 

66 

Wells Fargo & Company 

losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher 
interest payments. Similarly, a prolonged period of high interest 
rates may increase our funding costs, including the rates we pay 
on customer deposits. As described below, changes in interest 
rates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of 
our MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB 
significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over 
the last two years, however, the FRB could decide to further raise 
it or lower it in 2024. 

Changes in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread 
between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also 
reduce our net interest income and net interest margin. 
Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term 
rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve 
flattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest 
margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding 
increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term 
assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which 
interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest 
income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the 
interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while 
also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with 
the FRB. 

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on 

our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on 
assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of 
interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may 
hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate 
derivatives. We also experience the somewhat offsetting effect 
that our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can 
provide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite 
directions based on changes in interest rates. 

We generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There 
is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or 
option volatility could reduce our net interest income and 
earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material 
amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially 
different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates 
rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve 
changes, we may experience significant losses, including 
unrealized losses, on debt securities in our portfolio. To reduce 
our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt 
securities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic 
actions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In 
addition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis 
risk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. 
We have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as 

commercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, 
debt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to benchmark 
rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or 
other financial metrics. If any such benchmark rate or other 
referenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or 
discontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market 
benchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or 
differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or 
payment amount depending on the terms of the governing 
instrument. This could impact the financial performance of 
previously recorded transactions, result in losses on financial 
instruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or 
result in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, 
impact the overall interest rate environment and the availability 
or cost of funding transactions, affect our capital and liquidity 
planning and management, or have other adverse financial 
consequences. It may also result in significant operational, 
systems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and 

operational costs, legal or regulatory proceedings, reputational 
harm, or other adverse consequences. Because of changing 
economic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, 
affecting issuers and the performance of any underlying 
collateral, we may be required to recognize impairment in future 
periods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the 
debt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest 
rates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income 
also is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, 
foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in 
connection with our trading activities, which are conducted 
primarily to accommodate the investment and risk management 
activities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic 
hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt 
securities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair 
value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in 
noninterest income. As part of our business to support our 
customers, we trade public debt and equity securities and other 
financial instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with 
gains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although 
high market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-
related losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse 
effect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity 
levels. Although we have processes in place to measure and 
monitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including 
stress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance 
that our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding 
losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial 
results. 

The value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity 
securities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable 
equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and 
losses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are 
carried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement 
alternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized 
gains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity 
securities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may 
have a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. 
When, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of 
factors, including general economic and market conditions, the 
prospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company 
goes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, 
and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. 

Nonmarketable equity securities include our venture capital 

and private equity investments that could result in significant 
impairment losses for those investments carried under the 
measurement alternative or equity method. If we recognize an 
impairment for an investment, we write-down the carrying value 
of the investment to fair value, resulting in a charge to earnings, 
which could be significant. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk,” “– Mortgage 
Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “– Market Risk – Trading 
Activities,” and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the 
“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2 
(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-
Maturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation 
of our business, and our financial results and condition could be 
materially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage 
our liquidity.  We primarily rely on customer deposits to be a 
low-cost and stable source of funding for the loans we make and 

Wells Fargo & Company 

67 

Risk Factors (continued) 

the operation of our business. In addition to customer deposits, 
our sources of liquidity include certain debt and equity securities, 
our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets and to 
pledge loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the 
FHLB and the FRB, and our ability to raise funds in domestic and 
international money through capital markets. 

Our liquidity and our ability to fund and run our business 
could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions 
and factors, including financial and credit market disruption and 
volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial 
markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial 
crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of 
customer deposits, outflows of cash or collateral, an inability to 
access capital markets on favorable terms, or other adverse 
effects on our liquidity and funding. The financial system also 
experienced disruption and volatility in early 2023 due to the 
failure of several banks, and episodes of disruption, volatility or 
other adverse market conditions may continue to occur if there 
are additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures. 
Market disruption and volatility could also impact our credit 
spreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of 
U.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the 
same maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. 
Increases in interest rates and our credit spreads could 
significantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and 
factors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and 
funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the 
Company or negative news about the Company or the financial 
services industry generally which also may result in a loss of 
deposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital 
markets; any inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; 
disruptions or volatility in the market for securities repurchase 
agreements, or any inability to effectively access the market for 
securities repurchase agreements, which also may increase our 
short-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or 
restrictions, including changes to regulatory capital or liquidity 
requirements; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws 
on lines of credit; any inability to access secured borrowing 
facilities through the FHLB or FRB, or any negative perception in 
the market created by accessing these facilities; and, as described 
below, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of 
the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over 
which we have little or no control. Similarly, the speed with which 
information is disseminated and the speed with which customers 
can withdraw funds in response to information may also 
contribute to a faster and greater loss of deposits, particularly 
uninsured or non-operational deposits, as well as other adverse 
effects on liquidity or funding, similar to what contributed to the 
failure of several banks in early 2023. There can be no assurance 
that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets 
will not occur in the future. For example, concerns over 
geopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as 
global economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. 
In addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, 

including any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any 
associated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may 
cause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the 
sovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt 
ratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as 
well as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing 
economic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely 
affect the market value of the U.S. government securities or 
federal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we hold, 
the availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and 
our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as 

have other material adverse effects on the operation of our 
business and our financial results and condition. 

As noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our 
funding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial 
services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the 
rates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either 
because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we 
lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of 
funding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms 
of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive 
other investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money 
market mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. 
When customers move money out of bank deposits and into 
other investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of 
funds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our 
liquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit 
balances in order to manage under the asset cap. 

If we are unable to continue to fund our assets through 
customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms, 
if there are changes to our regulatory capital or liquidity 
requirements, or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs 
or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on 
an intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest 
margin, and financial results and condition may be materially 
adversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis in 2009, 
we may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise 
additional capital through the issuance of common stock, which 
could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or 
even eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or 
to raise additional capital. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 

Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report. 

Adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material 
adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and financial results 
and condition.  Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding 
are influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of 
our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow 
funds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and 
could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise 
collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely 
affect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit 
ratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ 
analysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, including 
our capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the 
level and quality of our earnings, and rating agency assumptions 
regarding the probability and extent of federal financial 
assistance or support. In addition to credit ratings, our borrowing 
costs are affected by various other external factors, including 
market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial 
services industry generally. There can be no assurance that we 
will maintain our credit ratings and outlooks and that credit 
ratings downgrades in the future would not have a material 
adverse effect on our ability to borrow funds and borrowing 
costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings also may trigger 
additional collateral or funding obligations which, depending on 
the severity of the downgrade, could have a material adverse 
effect on our liquidity, including as a result of credit-related 
contingent features in certain of our derivative contracts. 
For information on our credit ratings, see the “Risk 

Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and 
Funding – Credit Ratings” section and for information regarding 
additional collateral and funding obligations required of certain 
derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall

below investment grade, see Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for liquidity, and 
federal and state law, regulatory requirements, and certain 
contractual arrangements can limit those dividends.  Wells 
Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (the “Parent”), is 
a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It 
receives substantially all of its funding and liquidity from 
dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. We 
generally use these dividends and distributions, among other 
things, to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and 
interest and principal on our debt. Federal and state laws limit 
the amount of dividends and distributions that our bank and 
some of our nonbank subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer 
subsidiaries, may pay to the Parent. Similarly, as part of their 
supervisory authority, regulators may limit or restrict subsidiary 
capital distributions. In addition, as part of our resolution 
planning efforts, we have entered into a Support Agreement 
dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, 
among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding 
company and subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo 
Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the 
Parent designated from time to time as material entities for 
resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as 
related support entities in our resolution plan, pursuant to which 
the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the 
Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined 
triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a 
case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also, our right to 
participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s 
liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the 
subsidiary’s creditors. 

For additional information, see the “Regulation and 
Supervision – Dividend Restrictions” and “– Holding Company 
Structure” sections in our 2023 Form 10-K and the “Regulatory 
Matters” section and Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements 
and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

REGULATORY RISKS 

Current and future legislation and/or regulation could require 
us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our 
revenue and earnings, impose additional costs on us or 
otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or 
competitive position.  Our parent company, our subsidiary 
banks and many of our nonbank subsidiaries such as those 
related to our brokerage business, are subject to significant and 
extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as 
well as the applicable laws of the various jurisdictions outside of 
the U.S. where they conduct business. These regulations 
generally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, 
consumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial 
system as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. 
Economic, market and political conditions during the past few 
years have led to a significant amount of legislation and 
regulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services 
industry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of 
financial services companies from banking regulators. These laws 
and regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we 
do business and the products and services that we provide, affect 
or restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our 
ability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our 
revenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, 

limit subsidiary capital distributions, increase our capital or 
liquidity requirements, impose additional fines or assessments 
on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial 
services industry, and adversely affect our business operations or 
have other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenue 
in non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, 
economic and social developments in those jurisdictions, 
including sanctions or business restrictions, asset freezes or 
confiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic developments, or 
financial or social instability. In addition, changes to tax laws, 
regulations, and guidance may negatively impact our effective 
income tax rate, financial results, or the amount of any tax assets 
or liabilities. Furthermore, greater government oversight and 
scrutiny of Wells Fargo, as well as financial services companies 
generally, has increased our operational and compliance costs as 
we must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing 
our procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory 
standards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory 
requirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions, could continue to result in significant fines, 
penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, reputational 
harm, or other adverse consequences. 

Our consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, 

credit card and other consumer lending and non-lending 
businesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly 
complex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as 
enhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory 
examinations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s 
rules and requirements may continue to increase our compliance 
costs, limit the fees we can charge for certain products and 
services, and require changes in our business practices, which 
could limit or negatively affect our earnings as well as the 
products and services that we offer our customers. If we fail to 
meet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with 
respect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to 
increased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business 
activities including the products and services we can provide, 
reputational harm, or other adverse consequences. 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a 

comprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter 
derivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory 
agencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based 
swaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to 
negatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter 
derivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives 
or amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for 
engaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives 
activities. 

We are also subject to various rules and regulations related 
to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, 
including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and 
regulations require us to, among other things, implement policies 
and procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery 
and corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, 
currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. 
Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply 
with these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully 
effective or do not meet regulatory standards or expectations, 
we may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain 
business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse 
consequences. 

Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations 
enacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental 
authorities relating to the privacy of the information of 
customers, employees and others. These laws and regulations, 

Wells Fargo & Company 

69 

Risk Factors (continued) 

among other things, increase our compliance obligations; have a 
significant impact on our businesses’ collection, processing, 
sharing, use, and retention of personal data and reporting of data 
breaches; and provide for significant penalties for non-
compliance. 

In addition, we are subject to a number of consent orders 
and other regulatory actions, including a February 2018 consent 
order with the FRB regarding the Board’s governance and 
oversight of the Company, and the Company’s compliance and 
operational risk management program. This consent order limits 
the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the 
consent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain 
conditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely 
affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also 
subject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC 
regarding the Company’s compliance risk management program 
and past practices involving certain automobile collateral 
protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate 
lock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 
consent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in 
the Company’s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject 
to a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding 
multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer 
deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. We are also subject to 
older consent orders including dating back to 2011. Addressing 
these and other regulatory actions is expected to take multiple 
years, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays 
along the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely 
to continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and 
control infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory 
actions. 

Under the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank 
remains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in 
November 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain 
non-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors 
and senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain 
regulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain 
individuals and employees. 

The Company may be subject to further actions, including 

the imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory 
agreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators 
regarding similar or other issues. Regulators have indicated the 
potential for escalating consequences for banks that do not 
timely resolve open issues or have repeat issues. Furthermore, 
issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory 
action could affect our progress on others. Failure to satisfy the 
requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result 
in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, limitations on 
subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or liquidity 
requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse 
consequences, which could be significant. For example, in 
September 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money 
penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in 
addressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent 
order and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home 
Lending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB 
consent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the 
September 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB 
consent order, older consent orders including dating back to 
2011, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well 
as the implementation of their requirements, may continue to 
increase the Company’s costs, require the Company to reallocate 
resources away from growing its existing businesses, subject the 
Company to business restrictions, negatively impact the 
Company’s capital and liquidity, require the Company to undergo 

significant changes to its business, operations, products and 
services, and risk management practices, and subject the 
Company to other adverse consequences. For additional 
information on the Company’s consent orders, see the 
“Overview” section in this Report. 

Any future legislation, rule and/or regulation also could 

significantly change our regulatory environment, increase our 
cost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue, affect 
the competitive balance among banks and other financial 
services companies, and have a material adverse effect on our 
financial results and condition. 

For additional information on the significant regulations and 
regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect 
our business, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report 
and the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2023 Form 
10-K. 

We could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities 
or operations if regulators determine that our resolution or 
recovery plan is deficient.  Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB 
and the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits 
resolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate 
our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial 
distress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or 
FDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. 
If the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has 
deficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or 
liquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or 
operations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the 
FRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable 
to remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain 
assets or operations. 

In addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and 

periodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a 
range of options that we may consider during times of 
idiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any 
financial weaknesses and restore market confidence without 
extraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare 
and periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the 
FRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, 
they may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately 
require us to divest assets. 

Our security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of 
Wells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full. 
If Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy 
proceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution 
regime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly 
liquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the 
FDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires 
that security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses 
before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are 
substantial differences in the rights of creditors between the 
orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of 
creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain 
circumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure 
instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. 

The strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is 
a single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the 
only material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. 
However, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not 
binding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo. 

70 

Wells Fargo & Company 

To facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, we 
entered into the Support Agreement, pursuant to which the 
Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets to the IHC 
and will continue to transfer assets to the IHC from time to time. 
In the event of our material financial distress or failure, the IHC 
will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide capital 
and/or liquidity to the Bank and certain other direct and indirect 
subsidiaries of the Parent. Under the Support Agreement, the 
IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the Parent through 
subordinated notes and a committed line of credit. If certain 
liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if 
the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be 
forgiven, the committed line of credit would terminate, and the 
IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, 
any of which could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s 
liquidity and its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, 
and could result in the commencement of bankruptcy 
proceedings by the Parent at an earlier time than might have 
otherwise occurred if the Support Agreement were not 
implemented. 

Any resolution of the Company will likely impose losses on 
shareholders, unsecured debt holders and other creditors of the 
Parent, while the Parent’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. 
Creditors of some or all of our subsidiaries may receive 
significant or full recoveries on their claims, while the Parent’s 
security holders could face significant or complete losses. This 
outcome may arise whether the Company is resolved under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly 
liquidation authority, and whether the resolution is conducted 
using a single point of entry strategy or using a multiple point of 
entry strategy, in which the Parent and one or more of its 
subsidiaries would each undergo separate resolution 
proceedings. Furthermore, in a single point of entry or multiple 
point of entry strategy, losses at some or all of our subsidiaries 
could be transferred to the Parent and borne by the Parent’s 
security holders. Moreover, if either resolution strategy proved 
to be unsuccessful, our security holders could face greater losses 
than if the strategy had not been implemented. 

For additional information, see the “Regulatory Matters – 
‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in this 
Report. 

Regulatory rules and requirements may impose higher capital 
and liquidity levels, limiting our ability to pay common stock 
dividends, repurchase our common stock, invest in our 
business, or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers.  The Company and each of our insured depository 
institutions are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy 
requirements administered by federal banking regulators. In 
particular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal 
banking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital 
requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, 
among other things, establish required minimum ratios relating 
capital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal 
banking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a 
supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and 
our insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized 
rules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term 
debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and 
resiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity 
(TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final 
rules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable 
funding ratio. 

In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced 
capital and risk-management standards on large financial firms 
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital 
plan rule that establishes capital planning and other 
requirements that govern capital distributions, including 
dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including 
Wells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations 
implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs 
like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk 
and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and 
imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators 
determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the 
United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules 
implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and 
national banks. Furthermore, the FRB has established 
expectations regarding effective boards of directors of large 
BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established 
heightened governance and risk management standards for large 
national banks, such as the Bank. 

The Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, 

liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may 
limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including 
common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require 
us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that 
we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or 
liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, 
such as from the adoption of the current proposal to revise the 
Basel standards in the U.S., changes in regulatory interpretations 
regarding risk-weighted asset calculation methodologies, 
including the impact from securitizations of credit risk, or as a 
result of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk 
profile, could increase our funding costs, reduce our flexibility to 
source and deploy funding, or require us to liquidate assets or 
otherwise change our business, product offerings and/or 
investment plans, which may negatively affect our financial 
results. Although not currently anticipated, new capital 
requirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise 
additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock 
may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, 
federal banking regulations may continue to increase our 
compliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our 
business or provide loans or other products and services to our 
customers. 

For additional information, see the “Capital Management,” 

“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk 
and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” 
sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” 
section in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

FRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can 
significantly affect business and economic conditions and our 
financial results and condition.  The FRB regulates the supply of 
money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part 
our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we 
earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our 
net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest 
rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial 
instruments we hold, such as debt securities. In addition, its 
policies can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk 
that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in FRB policies, 
including its target range for the federal funds rate or actions 
taken to increase or decrease the size of its balance sheet, are 
beyond our control and can be hard to predict. The FRB 
significantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over 
the last two years to address high inflation, however, the FRB 

Wells Fargo & Company 

71 

Risk Factors (continued) 

could decide to further raise it or lower it in 2024. As noted 
above, changes in the interest rate environment and yield curve 
which may result from the FRB’s actions could negatively affect 
our net interest income and net interest margin. 

CREDIT RISKS 

Increased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in 
economic conditions or changes in market conditions, could 
require us to increase our provision for credit losses and 
allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse 
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
When we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit 
risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans. 
As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance 
of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results 
and condition. We also incur credit risk in connection with trading 
and other activities. As noted above, if the economic 
environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and 
counterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or 
other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit 
losses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses 
by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The 
amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of expected 
credit losses over the anticipated life of our loan portfolio 
(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for 
determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our 
financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and 
complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of 
economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of 
our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the 
allowance because of changing economic conditions, including 
falling home or commercial real estate values, higher 
unemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in 
consumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely 
affect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory 
environment or external factors, such as natural disasters, 
disease pandemics such as COVID-19, political or social matters, 
or trade policies, also can continue to influence recognition of 
credit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for 
credit losses. 

Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a 
variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit 
quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic 
conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses 
was appropriate at December 31, 2023, there is no assurance 
that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event 
of significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we 
experience significant loan growth, we may be required to 
increase the allowance in future periods, which would reduce our 
earnings. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. 

We may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the 
extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry 
segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or 
collateral.  Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our 
loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or 
similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group 
may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or 
market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market 
conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or 
geography may also impact related or dependent industries or 

the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in 
such industries to meet their financial obligations. We 
experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 
when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential 
real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater 
than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in 
many markets, including the Central Valley California market and 
several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As 
California is our largest banking state in terms of loans, 
deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic 
conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could 
result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in 
consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely 
affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may 
increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these 
borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration 
in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could 
result in materially higher credit losses, including for our 
residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes 
nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. 
We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as 
our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their 
contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. 

We are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. 
A deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects 
the business performance of our CRE borrowers, including 
increases in interest rates and related refinancing risks at 
maturity, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes 
in consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a 
continued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in 
materially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect 
on our financial results and condition. 

Challenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions 

may increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in 
non-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material 
adverse effect on our credit performance and results of 
operations and financial condition to the extent they negatively 
affect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. 
operations. 

Due to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain 

derivative transactions through central counterparty 
clearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these 
CCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we 
may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the 
CCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults 
on its obligations. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of non-
performance by our clients for which we clear transactions 
through CCPs to the extent such non-performance is not 
sufficiently covered by available collateral. 

For additional information regarding credit risk, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section and 
Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

OPERATIONAL, STRATEGIC, AND LEGAL RISKS 

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, 
controls or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors 
and other service providers, could disrupt our businesses, 
damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.  As 
a large financial institution that serves customers through 
numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking 
and other distribution channels across the U.S. and 
internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and 
monitor a large number of customer transactions on a 

72 

Wells Fargo & Company 

continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have a 
broad geographic footprint throughout the U.S. and 
internationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and 
mobile banking to provide products and services to our 
customers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory 
expectations regarding operational and information security 
have increased, and as cyber and other information security 
attacks have become more prevalent and complex, our 
operational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue 
to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, 
disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, 
data processing systems or other operating systems and 
facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based 
on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged 
as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly 
or partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and 
could in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction 
volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation 
or loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural 
disasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease 
pandemics such as COVID-19; events arising from local or larger 
scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as 
described below, cyber attacks or other information security 
incidents. The COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could 
result in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on 
us or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already 
experienced, including creating additional operational and 
compliance risks, such as the need to comply with rapidly 
changing regulatory requirements and to quickly implement new 
measures to protect the functionality of our systems, networks, 
and operations. 

Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our 

infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, 
entail significant costs, and create risks associated with 
implementing new systems and integrating them with existing 
ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our 
systems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and 
operating systems, including their security measures and 
controls, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and 
security issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover 
critical business processes or operations that have been 
disrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and 
consequences of such disruptions. Although we have enterprise 
incident response processes, business continuity plans and other 
safeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our 
business operations may be adversely affected by significant and 
widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating 
systems that support our businesses and customers. For 
example, we have experienced system issues caused by a variety 
of factors that have resulted in intermittent service 
interruptions, such as temporary disruptions to online and mobile 
banking services, delays in posting transactions, and customer 
difficulty signing into accounts. 

As a result of financial institutions and technology systems 

becoming more interconnected and complex, any operational 
incident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material 
impact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, 
third parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, such as 
exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors 
that provide services or security solutions for our operations, 
could continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including 
from information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or 
failures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies 
in the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are 

increased to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third 
parties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the 
risk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common 
service provider to our third parties could impede their ability to 
provide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In 
addition, we must meet regulatory requirements and 
expectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, 
and any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their 
obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, 
regulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, 
restrictions on our business, or other adverse consequences. 

Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls 

or operating systems that support our businesses and 
customers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to 
adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform 
their responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or 
oversee our third-party relationships, could result in business 
disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, remediation and other costs, violations of 
applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, customer 
harm, or other adverse consequences, any of which could 
materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial 
condition. 

A cyber attack or other information security incident could 
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, 
financial condition, or reputation.  Information security risks for 
large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally 
increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of 
new technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and 
cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the 
increased prevalence and availability of artificial intelligence, the 
increase in remote work arrangements, and the increased 
sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, 
terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign 
state-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to 
attempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to 
commit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or 
attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other 
users of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or 
other information to gain access to our data or that of our 
customers. Geopolitical matters may also elevate the risk of an 
information security threat, particularly by foreign state-
sponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our 
operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and 
storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our 
computer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, 
investment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our 
digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, 
hardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, 
to access our products and services, our customers may use 
personal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are 
beyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, 
software, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be 
the target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, 
which could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of 
fraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our 
customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or 
the disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third 
parties’ business operations. For example, various retailers have 
reported they were victims of cyber attacks in which large 
amounts of their customers’ data, including debit and credit card 
information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur 
costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent 

Wells Fargo & Company 

73 

Risk Factors (continued) 

transaction activity affecting our customers. We are also exposed 
to the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of 
the Company fails to comply with applicable policies and 
procedures and inappropriately circumvents information security 
controls for personal gain or other improper purposes. 

Due to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of 

financial institutions and technology systems, an information 
security incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream 
service providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact 
to us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties 
(including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, 
including those that facilitate our business activities or to which 
we outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, 
hardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be 
sources of information security risk to us. We could suffer 
material harm, including business disruptions, losses or 
remediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the 
failure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately 
safeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and 
software, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being 
compromised due to information security incidents affecting 
those third parties. 

Our risk and exposure to information security threats 

remains heightened because of, among other things, the 
persistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent 
size and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services 
industry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and 
mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote 
connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how 
they want to be served, our geographic footprint and 
international presence, our use of third parties, the outsourcing 
of some of our business operations, and the current global 
economic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo 
and other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service 
providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and 
adaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, 
malware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to 
exploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential 
validation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to 
disrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their 
cybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, 
proprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also 
focused on targeting online applications and services, such as 
online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and 
services provided by third parties, and have targeted the 
infrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread 
unavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As 
a result, information security and the continued development 
and enhancement of our controls, processes and systems 
designed to protect our networks, computers, software and data 
from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for 
Wells Fargo. We are also involved in industry cybersecurity 
efforts and working with other parties, including our third-party 
service providers and governmental agencies, to continue to 
enhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security 
threats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to 
continue to be required to expend significant resources to 
develop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate 
and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or 
incidents. Because the investigation of any information security 
breach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to 
complete, we may not be able to immediately address the 
consequences of a breach, which may further increase any 
associated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our 

insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such 
insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses 
associated with an information security breach. 

Cyber attacks or other information security incidents 
affecting us or third parties (including their downstream service 
providers) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our 
business activities or to which we outsource operations, or 
affecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers 
use to access our products and services, could result in business 
disruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations 
of applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or 
other adverse consequences, any of which could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

Our framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in 
mitigating risk and loss to us.  Our risk management framework 
seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established 
processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, 
monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are 
subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest 
rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and 
reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk 
management framework, there are inherent limitations to our 
risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the 
future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, 
identified or managed. Our risk management framework is also 
dependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and an 
appropriate risk mindset exist throughout the Company. The 
inability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the 
appropriate culture throughout the Company, including the 
inability to align performance management and compensation to 
achieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the 
effectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we 
are unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we 
may be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We 
process a large number of transactions each day and could 
continue to experience increased costs, regulatory investigations, 
or other adverse consequences if we do not accurately or 
completely execute a process or transaction, whether due to 
human error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent 
fraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service 
provider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, 
inappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other 
misconduct. 

In certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor 

and predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and 
credit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, 
there is no assurance that these models will appropriately or 
sufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future 
events or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are 
subject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to 
meet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, 
penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, or other 
adverse consequences, and any required modifications or 
changes to these models can impact our capital ratios and 
requirements and result in increased operational and compliance 
costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our 
various risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with 
the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our 
aggregation, management, and validation procedures, could 
result in ineffective risk management practices, business 
decisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or 
inaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting. 

74 

Wells Fargo & Company 

We also use artificial intelligence to help further inform or 

automate certain business decisions, operations, and risk 
management practices, as well as to improve our customer 
service, but there is no assurance that artificial intelligence will 
appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or human 
assessment or accurately predict future events or exposures. For 
example, the algorithms or datasets underlying our artificial 
intelligence may be inaccurate or include other weaknesses that 
could result in deficient or biased data outputs or other 
unintended consequences. Accordingly, even though we may 
have controls, our use of artificial intelligence could result in 
ineffective business decisions, operations, risk management 
practices, or customer service, legal or regulatory proceedings, 
reputational harm, or other adverse effects on our business or 
financial results. 

Previous financial and credit crises and resulting regulatory 

reforms highlighted both the importance and some of the 
limitations of managing unanticipated risks, and our regulators 
remain focused on ensuring that financial institutions, and Wells 
Fargo in particular, maintain risk management policies and 
practices. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, 
we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially 
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

We may be exposed to additional legal or regulatory 
proceedings, costs, and other adverse consequences related to 
instances where customers may have experienced financial 
harm.  We have identified and may in the future identify areas or 
instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, 
including as a result of our continuing efforts to strengthen our 
risk and control infrastructure. For example, we identified certain 
issues related to past practices involving certain automobile 
collateral protection insurance policies and certain issues related 
to the unused portion of guaranteed automobile protection 
waiver or insurance agreements. We also previously entered into 
settlements to resolve inquiries or investigations by various 
government entities and lawsuits by non-government parties 
arising out of certain retail sales practices of the Company. 
Negative publicity or public opinion resulting from instances 
where customers may have experienced financial harm may 
continue to increase the risk of reputational harm to our 
business. Similarly, the identification of areas or instances where 
customers may have experienced financial harm could lead to, 
and in some cases has already resulted in, significant remediation 
costs, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory 
proceedings, compliance and other costs, or other adverse 
consequences. 

For additional information, see the “Overview – Retail Sales 

Practices Matters” and “Overview – Customer Remediation 
Activities” sections in this Report. 

We may incur fines, penalties, business restrictions, and other 
adverse consequences from regulatory violations or from any 
failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations.  We 
maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we 
comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are 
subject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and 
expectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly 
complex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject 
to consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to 
various conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or 
issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations 
and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in 
the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental 
entities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in 

jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even 
conflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal 
and state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to 
the products and services we may offer or other business 
activities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance 
difficulties or issues. Additionally, regulatory or compliance issues 
at other financial institutions could result in regulatory scrutiny 
for us. We could also be subject to regulatory actions, including 
fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse 
consequences, if we fail to obtain applicable licensing or 
registration in any jurisdiction in which we offer our products and 
services. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require 
us to report transactions and other information to regulators and 
other governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, 
exchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to 
fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse 
consequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately 
provide regulatory reports, customer notices, or disclosures. 

Moreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for 

the imposition of fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other 
adverse consequences for noncompliance even though the 
noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even 
though there were systems and procedures in place at the time 
designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to 
regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in 
the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain 
non-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. 
OFAC may impose fines, penalties, or restrictions on certain 
business activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations 
even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the 
violations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or 
regulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or 
any failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, 
including any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent 
orders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant 
fines, penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, 
negative impacts to our capital and liquidity, requirements to 
undergo significant changes to our business, operations, 
products and services, and risk management practices, 
reputational harm, loss of customers, or other adverse 
consequences. Furthermore, these consequences may escalate 
to the extent issues are not timely resolved or are repeated. 

Reputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged 
conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry 
generally, could adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition.  Reputation risk, or the risk 
to our business, earnings and capital from negative public 
opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased 
substantially because of our size and profile in the financial 
services industry, sales practices related matters, and instances 
where customers may have experienced financial harm. Negative 
public opinion about the financial services industry generally or 
Wells Fargo specifically could adversely affect our reputation and 
our ability to keep and attract customers. Negative public opinion 
could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of 
activities, including sales practices; mortgage, auto or other 
consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing 
activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client 
accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business 
relationships; identification and management of potential 
conflicts of interest from transactions, obligations and interests 
with and among our customers; environmental, social and 
governance practices; regulatory compliance; risk management; 

Wells Fargo & Company

Risk Factors (continued) 

incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or 
inadequate protection or improper use of customer information, 
and from actions taken by government regulators and 
community or other organizations in response to that conduct. 
Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to 
detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party 
service providers that could potentially harm customers or our 
reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and 
procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct. 
Furthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or 
prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our 
business or operations could result in significant reputational 
harm. In addition, because we conduct most of our businesses 
under the “Wells Fargo” brand, negative public opinion about one 
business also could affect our other businesses. Moreover, 
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain 
members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect 
our reputation. The proliferation of social media websites utilized 
by Wells Fargo and other third parties, as well as the personal use 
of social media by our employees and others, including personal 
blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that 
negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be 
posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or 
have other negative consequences, including as a result of our 
employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized 
manner in various social media outlets. 

Wells Fargo and other financial institutions have been 
targeted from time to time by protests and demonstrations, 
which have included disrupting the operation of our retail 
banking locations, and have been subject to negative public 
commentary, including with respect to certain business practices 
and the fees charged for various products and services. Wells 
Fargo and other financial institutions have also been subject to 
negative publicity as a result of providing or reducing financial 
services to or making investments in industries or organizations 
subject to stakeholder concerns. There can be no assurance that 
continued protests or negative public opinion of the Company 
specifically or large financial institutions generally will not harm 
our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of 
operations, and financial condition. 

If we are unable to develop and execute effective business 
plans or strategies or manage change effectively, our 
competitive standing and results of operations could suffer.  In 
order to advance our business goals, we may undertake business 
plans or strategies related to, among other things, our 
organizational structure, our compliance and risk management 
framework, our expenses and efficiency, the types of products 
and services we offer, the types of businesses we engage in, the 
geographies in which we operate, the manner in which we serve 
our clients and customers, the third parties with which we do 
business, and the methods and distribution channels by which we 
offer our products and services. Accomplishing these business 
plans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require 
significant financial, technological, management and other 
resources, may divert management attention and resources away 
from other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses 
and ability to generate revenue. There is no guarantee that any 
business plans or strategies, including our current efficiency 
initiatives, will ultimately be successful. To the extent we are 
unable to develop or execute effective business plans or 
strategies or manage change effectively, our competitive 
position, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of 
operations may be adversely affected. 

In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest 
certain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture 
may cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other 
benefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than 
expected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain 
customers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses 
or assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other 
long-lived assets related to those businesses or assets, which 
could adversely affect our financial results. 

Similarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our 
products, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of 
companies or businesses in the financial services industry. We 
generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we 
can acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other 
financial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or 
on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals 
will be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches 
and/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a 
condition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
When we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall 
depending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to 
be acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to 
existing stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue 
common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, 
difficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may 
cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, 
increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected 
benefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in 
higher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an 
increase in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our 
business or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability 
to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated 
benefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on 
integration may also impair our ability to grow our existing 
businesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the 
acquired company or business operates internationally or in a 
geographic location where we do not already have significant 
business operations and/or employees. 

Our operations and business could be adversely affected by the 
impacts of climate change.  The physical effects of climate 
change, including the increased prevalence and severity of 
extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as 
hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere 
with our operations or those of our third-party service providers, 
which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause 
losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively 
affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the 
credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the 
deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition, 
changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on 
account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a 
low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain 
industries, sectors or geographies, which may increase our credit 
risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products 
and services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon 
economy could affect our business practices or result in 
additional costs or other adverse consequences to our business 
operations. Legislation and/or regulation in connection with 
climate change, as well as stakeholder perceptions and 
expectations related to climate change and its impacts, could 
require us to change certain of our business and/or risk 
management practices, impose additional costs on us, reduce our 
revenue or business opportunities, subject us to legal or 
regulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our 

76 

Wells Fargo & Company 

operations and business. Additionally, climate-related data may 
be based on emerging practices that are subject to measurement 
uncertainties or may be available only from third-parties, which 
can impact the quality and consistency of the data and make it 
difficult to collect, validate, and analyze, impact the effectiveness 
of our related models, projections, strategies, and decisions, or 
result in legal actions or other adverse consequences. Moreover, 
our reputation may be damaged and we may lose business 
opportunities as a result of our response to climate change or our 
strategy for the transition to a low carbon economy, including if 
we are unable or perceived to be unable to achieve our objectives 
or if our response is disliked or perceived to be ineffective or 
insufficient. Similarly, any overstatement or mislabeling of the 
environmental benefits of our products, services or activities may 
subject us to legal actions, reputational harm, or other adverse 
consequences. For additional information on regulatory 
developments in response to climate change, see the 
“Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. 

We are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences from legal actions.  Wells Fargo and some of its 
subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, 
arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning 
matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and 
many of those proceedings and investigations expose 
Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse 
consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate 
outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for 
legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions 
become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We 
may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not 
established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a 
legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts 
accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal 
action, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could 
materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial 
condition. 

As noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory 

oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory 
investigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition 
to imposing potentially significant fines, penalties, business 
restrictions, and other adverse consequences, regulatory 
authorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of 
wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection 
with settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, 
loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital 
markets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to 
engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or 
services, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. 

For additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to 

Financial Statements in this Report. 

MORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS 

Our mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to 
quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, 
and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to 
reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new 
mortgage loans.  We earn revenue from fees we receive for 
originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. 
Changes in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair 
value of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage 
loans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from 
loan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our 
MSRs usually tends to increase due to a decline in the likelihood 

of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. 
When rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase 
and the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with 
some offsetting revenue effect. Even though changes in interest 
rates can cause this offsetting effect, the effect is not perfect, 
either in amount or timing. 

We typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge 
our mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of 
our risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. 
Hedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant 
losses from our hedging activities. 

We rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet 
their conforming loan requirements and on government insuring 
agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee 
loans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or 
government insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their 
purchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, 
and thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We 
cannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will 
not materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of 
conforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a 
conforming loan. Similarly, there have been various proposals to 
reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role 
of the GSEs, which, depending on any ultimate reforms enacted, 
could have an adverse impact on our mortgage banking business. 
In addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that 
do not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring 
agencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance 
sheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be 
used to originate new loans. 

For additional information, see the “Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate 
and Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of 
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” 
sections in this Report. 

We may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse 
consequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect 
to the residential mortgage loans or other assets we originate 
or service.  For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we 
could become subject to monetary damages and other civil 
penalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or 
the inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as 
foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the 
loans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or 
regulations. 

Additionally, for residential mortgage loans that we 

originate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or 
indemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or 
insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach 
of contractual representations or warranties in the agreements 
under which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty 
agreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. If economic 
conditions or the housing market worsen, we could have 
increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on 
repurchases. We may also have repurchase or other obligations 
to the extent we originate and securitize other assets, such as 
credit card loans. 

Furthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for 
the mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer 
or master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization 
trustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to 
repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit

losses, any of which could significantly reduce our net servicing 
income. 

We may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers and/or 

securitization investors, legal actions, or other adverse 
consequences if we fail to meet our servicing obligations, 
including our obligations with respect to mortgage foreclosure 
actions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our 
mortgage banking revenue may be negatively affected to the 
extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure 
or other servicing related costs. In addition, we may continue to 
be subject to fines, penalties, business restrictions, reputational 
harm, and other adverse consequences as a result of actual or 
perceived deficiencies in our mortgage servicing practices, 
including with respect to our compliance with existing consent 
order requirements, our foreclosure practices, our loss mitigation 
activities such as loan modifications or forbearances, or our 
servicing of flood zone properties. We may also face risks, 
including regulatory, compliance, and market risks, as we pursue 
our previously announced plans to reduce the amount of 
residential mortgage loans we service.

Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

COMPETITIVE RISKS 

We face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly 
evolving financial services industry.  We compete with other 
financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is 
undergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory 
reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and 
economic conditions. Our success depends on, among other 
things, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring 
relationships with our customers based on the quality of our 
customer service, the wide variety of products and services that 
we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and 
services to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the 
pricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution 
channels available for our customers, our innovation, and our 
reputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all 
of these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, 
market share and results of operations and/or cause us to 
increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to 
remain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or 
reprice our products and services from time to time may be 
limited and could be influenced significantly by the economic, 
regulatory and political environment for large financial 
institutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. 
Furthermore, any changes in the types of products and services 
that we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those 
products and services could result in a loss of customer 
relationships and market share and could materially adversely 
affect our results of operations. 

Continued technological advances and the growth of 

e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository 
institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were 
banking products, and for financial institutions and other 
companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial 
solutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and 
payment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including 
digital currencies and alternative payment methods, may 
diminish the importance of depository institutions and other 

financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. 
We may not respond effectively to these and other competitive 
threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to 
offer products and services at lower prices, increase our 
investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing 
products and services, and/or develop new products and services 
to respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the 
extent we are not successful in developing and introducing new 
products and services or responding or adapting to the 
competitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we 
may lose customer relationships and our growth prospects and 
results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical 
to the success of our business and failure to do so could 
adversely affect our business performance, competitive 
position and future prospects.  The success of Wells Fargo is 
heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, 
including our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, 
including commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, 
capital markets, risk management, and technology, the 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also 
seek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of 
succession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract 
and retain highly qualified employees, we must provide 
competitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, 
effectively manage employee performance and development, 
and foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large 
financial institution and additionally to the extent we remain 
subject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on 
compensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our 
ability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially 
if some of our competitors may not be subject to these same 
compensation limitations. Similarly, union organizing activity, 
some of which has been successful, could continue to increase 
our operational complexity and costs. In addition, our response to 
this activity could be perceived negatively and harm our 
reputation and business, subject us to legal actions, or adversely 
affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we 
are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, 
including successors for senior leadership positions, our business 
performance, competitive position and future prospects may be 
adversely affected. 

FINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS 

Changes in accounting standards, and changes in how 
accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could 
materially affect our financial results and condition.  From time 
to time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting 
and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our 
external financial statements. In addition, accounting standard 
setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such 
as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their 
previous interpretations or positions on how these standards 
should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting 
standards and changes in current interpretations are typically 
beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially 
affect our financial results and condition, including requiring a 
retrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. 
Similarly, any change in our accounting policies could also 
materially affect our financial statements. For additional 
information, see the “Current Accounting Developments” section 
in this Report.

Our financial statements require certain assumptions, 
judgments, and estimates and rely on the effectiveness of our 
internal control over financial reporting.  Pursuant to U.S. 
GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions, judgments, 
and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, 
among other items, in determining the allowance for credit 
losses, the liability for legal actions, goodwill impairment, and the 
fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Several of our 
accounting policies are critical because they require management 
to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about 
matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that 
materially different amounts would be reported under different 
conditions or using different assumptions. If the assumptions, 
judgments, or estimates underlying our financial results are 
incorrect or different from actual results, we could experience 
unexpected losses or other adverse impacts, some of which could 
be significant. For a description of our critical accounting policies, 
see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section in this Report. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires 
our management to evaluate the Company’s disclosure controls 
and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control 
over financial reporting. We are required to disclose, in our annual 
report on Form 10-K, the existence of any “material weaknesses” 
in our internal controls. We cannot assure that we will not 
identify one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any 
given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our 
reputation or stock price of disclosure of a material weakness. 
We could also be required to devote significant resources to 
remediate any material weakness. In addition, our customers may 
rely on the effectiveness of certain of our operational and 
internal controls as a service provider, and any deficiency in those 
controls could affect our customers and damage our reputation 
or business. Sarbanes-Oxley also limits the types of non-audit 
services our outside auditors may provide to us in order to 
preserve their independence from us. If our auditors were found 
not to be independent of us, we could be required to engage new 
auditors and re-file financial statements and audit reports with 
the SEC. We could be out of compliance with SEC rules until new 
financial statements and audit reports were filed, limiting our 
ability to raise capital and resulting in other adverse 
consequences.

Any factor described in this Report or in any of our other SEC 

filings could by itself, or together with other factors, adversely 
affect our financial results and condition. Refer to our quarterly 
reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in 2024 for material 
changes to the above discussion of risk factors. There are factors 
not discussed above or elsewhere in this Report that could 
adversely affect our financial results and condition.
