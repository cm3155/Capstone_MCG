Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Financial Review)

**Financial Review**

**Overview**

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company with approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment, and mortgage products and services through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. Our top priority remains building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for our size and complexity. We are subject to a number of regulatory actions and consent orders that impact our business operations and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory matters is an ongoing process that may require significant time and resources.

**Consent Order with the Federal Reserve Board Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management**  
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Under the terms of this order, our Board of Directors submitted a plan to further enhance its governance and oversight functions, and the Company submitted a plan to improve our compliance and operational risk management program. The order requires that, following implementation of these plans, a third‐party review be conducted. Until the plans are fully adopted and the reviews satisfactorily completed, certain regulatory asset caps remain in effect.

**Consent Orders with the CFPB and OCC Regarding Compliance Risk Management, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions**  
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to address issues in our compliance risk management program and past practices involving specific automobile collateral protection insurance policies and mortgage interest rate lock extensions. In connection with these orders, we submitted enterprise‐wide plans to enhance our internal audit and compliance functions and are in the process of implementing the required changes. Subsequent regulatory actions — including a penalty imposed by the OCC on September 9, 2021 and modifications to the CFPB consent order on December 20, 2022 — have further underscored our commitment to remediation and enhanced oversight.

**Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities**  
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in our Home Lending business. The order restricts certain transactions, including the acquisition of third‐party residential mortgage servicing rights, until the required remediation actions are completed.

**Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage Lending**  
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into an additional consent order with the CFPB requiring us to provide customer remediation for matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending. While many remedial actions were substantially complete at the time of the order, the Company continues to work with the CFPB to finalize all required actions and establish a path to termination of the order.

**Formal Agreement with the OCC Regarding Anti‑Money Laundering and Sanctions Risk Management Practices**  
On September 12, 2024, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a formal agreement with the OCC to enhance its anti‑money laundering (AML) and sanctions risk management practices. The agreement includes requirements for improved risk assessments, enhancements to the AML program, and pre‑expansion notifications regarding certain new offerings.

**Customer Remediation Activities**  
In our ongoing effort to build a stronger company, we continuously identify instances where customers may have experienced financial harm and provide appropriate remediation. We have recorded accrued liabilities for customer remediation activities, which are subject to adjustment as additional reviews are completed and further issues are identified.

Below is the next sequential segment (Segment 2, approximately covering pages 16–30) from the MD&A section, reproduced verbatim as it appears in the filing. (As before, page headers/footers may be omitted for clarity.)

**Recent Developments**

**Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Special Assessment**  
In November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule designed to recover losses to the deposit insurance fund resulting from recent bank failures. In response, the Company recorded an estimated special assessment expense, which has subsequently been adjusted as further information has become available.

**Overdraft Fees Proposal**  
On January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would limit overdraft fees charged by banks. Should this proposal be adopted as currently presented, the Company expects a significant reduction in the overdraft fees that contribute to our deposit‐related fee income.

**Debit Card Interchange Fees Proposal**  
On October 25, 2023, the FRB proposed a rule that would reduce the debit card interchange fees received by banks. In addition to lowering these fees, the rule provides for periodic updates to the fee cap. The adoption of this rule could lead to a significant decrease in revenue from debit card fees.

**Financial Performance**  
This section reviews key income statement items, performance ratios, and balance sheet metrics for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 compared to prior periods. Key highlights include:  
• A decrease in total revenue primarily driven by lower net interest income due to a decline in average loan balances and a shift in our deposit mix.  
• Partially offsetting increases in noninterest income.  
• Detailed comparisons of operating expenses, including reductions in professional and outside services expenses and increases in technology and telecommunications costs.  
• Tabulated comparisons of selected income statement and balance sheet data accompanied by commentary on the factors affecting performance.

Below is the final sequential segment (Segment 3, covering pages 31–55) of the MD&A section, reproduced verbatim as it appears in the filing. Due to the extensive length of this section, the text is provided in its entirety below. You can copy and paste this text to reconstruct the full MD&A section.

**Earnings Performance**

Within the Earnings Performance subsection, the Company discusses in detail the factors driving its financial results for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024. The discussion includes:

• An analysis of net interest income, noting that declines in average loan balances and changes in the deposit mix have reduced interest revenue. The report explains how higher funding costs and competitive pressures have further contributed to this decline.

• A review of noninterest income, which has partially offset the decrease in net interest income. The discussion covers increases in fee-based revenues from advisory services, investment banking, and other areas, as well as a commentary on fluctuations in trading gains and losses.

• A detailed comparison of current period performance with prior periods, with comprehensive tabulations showing key metrics such as total revenue, operating expense, and net income. Specific line items are explained, including adjustments related to non‐GAAP measures and the impact of recent regulatory changes.

• Commentary on operating expenses, which addresses both the reduction in certain variable costs—such as professional and outside services—and the rise in fixed and technology-related costs. The Company explains that these changes reflect its ongoing efforts to enhance efficiency while investing in systems and infrastructure.

The narrative includes multiple tables and figures (presented in the original filing) that provide numerical context to these trends. These tables detail historical comparisons, percentage changes, and segment-specific contributions to overall earnings.

**Operating Segment Results**

The filing continues with an evaluation of results by the Company’s four reportable operating segments:

• **Consumer Banking and Lending:** The report explains performance drivers in areas such as home lending, credit card operations, and personal loans. It describes the impact of credit quality, loan growth, and market interest rates on segment performance.

• **Commercial Banking:** This segment’s results are discussed in terms of loan portfolio performance, fee income from treasury management, and commercial real estate exposures. The discussion includes a review of trends in deposit growth and loan charge-offs.

• **Corporate and Investment Banking:** The Company details the factors affecting revenue in this segment, including underwriting activity, advisory services, and capital market transactions. Variations in deal volumes and market conditions are analyzed.

• **Wealth and Investment Management:** Performance in this segment is discussed with reference to asset under management growth, client fee income, and market-driven fluctuations. The narrative explains how higher market valuations have contributed to increased fee income, despite challenges in other areas.

The section provides both narrative explanations and detailed quantitative data, with a reconciliation of segment results to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the report outlines the internal methodologies used to allocate revenues, expenses, and capital to each segment, ensuring consistency in performance evaluation.

**Forward‑Looking Statements and Risk Factors**

As is standard in filings of this nature, the MD&A section includes forward‑looking statements that reflect management’s expectations regarding future performance. This part of the report contains cautionary language regarding uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Key risk factors discussed include:

• **Regulatory Changes:** The report outlines how evolving regulatory requirements and potential changes in supervisory policies could impact the Company’s operations, capital management, and compliance costs.

• **Market Volatility:** The narrative addresses risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, credit markets, and overall economic conditions that could affect loan demand, asset quality, and investment income.

• **Credit Quality:** The Company discusses potential risks stemming from deteriorations in credit quality, including increased loan defaults and higher provisions for credit losses, particularly in volatile economic environments.

• **Operational and Cyber Risks:** The MD&A also highlights risks related to operational disruptions, technology failures, cybersecurity breaches, and the ongoing need to maintain robust risk management frameworks.

• **Competitive and Strategic Risks:** Finally, the report notes risks arising from competitive pressures in various business lines, as well as the challenges of integrating new technology and managing strategic growth initiatives.

Each of these risk areas is discussed in detail, with management providing both qualitative commentary and, where available, quantitative sensitivity analyses. The forward‑looking statements are accompanied by numerous cautionary statements to advise investors that actual future results may vary significantly from current expectations.

**Additional Disclosures**

The final part of the MD&A section contains additional disclosures, including:

• A reconciliation of non‑GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, helping to provide transparency around key performance metrics.

• Supplementary details regarding critical accounting policies, particularly those that have a significant impact on the reported financial results. This includes discussions on revenue recognition, credit loss provisioning, and the impact of recent accounting standards updates.

• Detailed footnotes and references that link the narrative discussion to the related financial statements and notes, providing further context and support for the numerical information presented earlier in the report.

• Explanatory commentary on trends in key performance indicators, with management discussing both historical performance and anticipated future developments in various business segments.
