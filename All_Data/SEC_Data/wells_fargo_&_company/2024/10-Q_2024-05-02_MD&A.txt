[The detailed Summary Financial Data table appears in the document.]

**Overview**

Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company that has approximately $1.96 trillion in assets. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment, and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s 2023 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at March 31, 2024.

Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, some of which are described below. These regulatory actions may require the Company, among other things, to undertake changes to its business, operations, products, and risk management practices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple years, and we may continue to experience delays or identify additional issues as we enhance our risk and control infrastructure. Regulators have indicated that failure to resolve these issues in a timely manner could result in escalating fines, penalties, business restrictions, increased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse consequences. Despite these challenges, the Company is committed to allocating the necessary resources to maintain strong business practices, controls, and an appropriate culture.

**Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management**  
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors submitted a plan to further enhance its governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted a plan to further improve its compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as it works to address the consent order provisions. The order further requires that, following the FRB’s acceptance of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation thereof, an initial third‑party review of the enhancements be completed. Until this review is complete and the plans are fully implemented to the FRB’s satisfaction, the Company’s total consolidated assets (as defined in the consent order) will be capped at the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two‑quarter daily average basis, and after removal, a second third‑party review will assess the sustainability of the improvements.

**Consent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Compliance Risk Management, Automobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and Mortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions**  
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters regarding its compliance risk management program and past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and mortgage interest rate lock extensions. Under these orders, the Company submitted an enterprise‑wide compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance its internal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial law and the terms of the orders. In addition, the Company submitted for non‑objection plans to remediate customers affected by these matters and to manage the remediation activities. The Company continues to work to address the provisions of these consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million penalty against the Company related to insufficient progress under its April 2018 consent order regarding its Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to clarify its termination process.

**Consent Order with the OCC Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities**  
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the OCC requiring it to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. In addition, the consent order restricts the Company from acquiring certain third‑party residential mortgage servicing rights and from transferring certain mortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of its mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is provided.

**Consent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile Lending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage Lending**  
On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order with the CFPB requiring it to provide customer remediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; to maintain practices ensuring that auto lending customers receive refunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile protection agreements; to comply with specific business practice requirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and to pay a $1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. Many of the required actions were substantially complete at the time the order was entered, and the order sets forth a path to termination once all remaining actions are completed.

**Customer Remediation Activities**  
As part of our ongoing efforts to build a better company, we continuously identify instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. We provide remediation as appropriate and implement additional operational and control procedures to prevent recurrence. We work closely with our regulatory agencies on these matters. The Company has accrued for the probable and estimable costs of customer remediation activities; these amounts may change as further facts emerge and as reviews and communications with regulators continue.

**Earnings Performance**

Wells Fargo net income for first quarter 2024 was $4.6 billion ($1.20 diluted EPS), compared with $5.0 billion ($1.23 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income decreased in first quarter 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a $1.1 billion decrease in net interest income and a $662 million increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in noninterest income.

**Net Interest Income**  
Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in first quarter 2024, compared with the same period a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interest‑bearing deposits and long‑term debt, as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on interest‑earning assets.

**Earnings Performance (continued)**

Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities not included in these segments are aggregated within Corporate. The management reporting process measures segment performance based on our internal organization and is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management. This process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes adjustments—such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable‑equivalent adjustments—to consistently reflect income from both taxable and tax‑exempt sources.

**Funds Transfer Pricing**  
Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits; both are reflected in net interest income. The net impact of these charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.

**Revenue and Expense Sharing**  
When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense—with an associated referral fee or cost allocation—to the other line, based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. When a business line uses a service provided by another line or an enterprise function (included in Corporate), expenses are allocated based on the cost and usage of the service. These methodologies are periodically reviewed and updated.

**Taxable‑Equivalent Adjustments**  
Taxable‑equivalent adjustments related to tax‑exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income. In each instance, the adjustments include corresponding impacts on income tax expense (benefit) and are eliminated to reconcile with our consolidated financial results.

**Allocated Capital**  
Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk‑sensitive framework primarily based on our regulatory capital requirements. The assumptions and methodologies used for capital allocation are periodically reviewed and updated. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful measure, as it reflects each segment’s use of capital.

**Selected Metrics**  
We present various financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses to evaluate segment performance. These metrics help investors assess trends, customer growth, and overall performance in each reportable segment or line of business.

**Earnings Performance (continued)**

**Operating Segment Results**  
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see Table 5 below. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management. This process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments—such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable‑equivalent adjustments—to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax‑exempt sources, allowing management to assess performance consistently across segments.

**Funds Transfer Pricing**  
Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits; both items are included in net interest income. The net impact of these charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.

**Revenue and Expense Sharing**  
When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense—with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line—based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements. When a business line uses a service provided by another line or an enterprise function (included in Corporate), the expense is allocated based on the cost and usage of that service. These allocation methodologies are periodically reviewed and updated.

**Taxable‑Equivalent Adjustments**  
Taxable‑equivalent adjustments related to tax‑exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while those related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income. In each case, the adjustments include corresponding impacts on income tax expense (benefit) and are eliminated in reconciliation to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

**Allocated Capital**  
Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk‑sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements. The assumptions and methodologies used for capital allocation are periodically reviewed and updated. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess each segment’s use of capital.

**Selected Metrics**  
We present certain financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable operating segment results. These metrics are useful to investors for assessing performance, customer growth, and trends in each reportable segment or line of business.

*Table 6: Operating Segment Results – Highlights*  
[The table is reproduced verbatim in the document and includes detailed figures by segment, reconciliations to consolidated financial results, and accompanying footnotes.]

**Earnings Performance (continued) – Consumer Banking and Lending**  
The discussion continues with a detailed review of Consumer Banking and Lending performance, including:
• Income statement comparisons (as shown in Table 6a) that cover net interest income, noninterest income (with breakdowns such as deposit‑related fees, card fees, mortgage banking income, and other income), and total revenue.  
• A reconciliation of segment net income and related metrics to the consolidated financial results.  
• Selected balance sheet data (presented in Table 6b) that show loan and deposit trends, along with commentary on factors driving changes in loan demand, deposit outflows, and overall segment performance.

**Regulatory Matters**

During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company continued to be subject to evolving regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state authorities. These regulatory matters include oversight by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Company is required to comply with a broad range of regulatory directives which may necessitate operational adjustments, capital conservation measures, and changes to risk management practices. Any modifications to existing regulations or the introduction of new requirements could materially impact the Company’s operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company’s ongoing efforts to address these regulatory matters include monitoring regulatory developments, engaging with regulatory bodies, and implementing policies and procedures to ensure compliance.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Current Accounting Developments**

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Significant estimates include, for example, the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of complex financial instruments, and the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. Changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial results.

Recent accounting developments that the Company is evaluating include changes to revenue recognition standards, modifications to lease accounting guidance, and updates to the measurement of fair values for certain financial instruments. The Company is assessing the potential impact of these developments on its financial statements and internal controls and will adopt any new or revised standards in accordance with the applicable guidance.

**Forward‑Looking Statements**

Certain statements in this MD&A constitute forward‑looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. These forward‑looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Key factors that could affect future results include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, competitive dynamics, regulatory developments, and other risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward‑looking statements, except as required by law.

**Risk Factors**

Investors are cautioned that the risks described below, together with other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Report, may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward‑looking statements. Among the key risk factors are:
• Changes in regulatory requirements—including modifications to capital and liquidity requirements—that could adversely affect the Company’s business.
• Adverse economic and market conditions, such as fluctuations in interest rates, deteriorations in credit quality, or an economic downturn, which could impact loan demand and increase credit losses.
• Operational risks, including those related to cybersecurity breaches, system failures, or other disruptions that could impede business operations.
• Intensifying competitive pressures from other financial institutions and nonbank competitors that may limit the Company’s ability to grow revenues and control costs.
• Uncertainties regarding the integration of new technologies and efficiency initiatives, which may affect the Company’s ability to meet evolving market and regulatory demands.

The Company’s management continues to implement and enhance risk management practices and internal controls to mitigate these risks; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to avoid material adverse effects on the business.
