Presentation of Noninterest Income
In the fourth quarter of 2022, PNC updated the name of the noninterest income line item “Capital markets related” to “Capital markets
and advisory.” This update did not impact the components of the category. All periods presented herein reflect these changes. For a
description of each updated noninterest income revenue stream, see Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Signature Bank Portfolio Acquisition
On October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an
agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represents approximately $16
billion in total commitments, including approximately $9 billion of funded loans. See Note 17 Subsequent Events for more

2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Income Statement Highlights
Net income of $1.6 billion, or $3.60 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023 increased $70 million, or 5%, compared
to $1.5 billion, or $3.36 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower expenses and higher
noninterest income, partially offset by a decline in net interest income.
• For the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023:
• Total revenue decreased $60 million, to $5.2 billion.
• Net interest income of $3.4 billion decreased $92 million, or 3%, as higher yields on interest-earning assets
were more than offset by increased funding costs.
• Net interest margin decreased 8 basis points to 2.71%.
• Noninterest income increased $32 million, or 2%, primarily due to higher residential and commercial
mortgage revenue, partially offset by lower capital markets and advisory fees and a decline in private equity
revenue.
• Provision for credit losses of $129 million in the third quarter of 2023 included the impact of our updated economic
outlook and portfolio activity. The second quarter of 2023 included a provision for credit losses of $146 million.
• Noninterest expense decreased $127 million, or 4%, to $3.2 billion, reflecting a continued focus on expense
management as expenses were lower or stable across all categories.
Net income of $4.8 billion, or $10.94 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2023 increased $199 million, or 4%,
compared to $4.6 billion, or $10.39 per diluted common share, for the nine months ended 2022, as a result of higher net interest
income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and increased expenses.
• For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022:
• Total revenue increased $0.8 billion, or 5%, to $16.1 billion.
• Net interest income increased $1.2 billion, or 13%, as a result of higher interest-earning asset yields and
balances, partially offset by higher funding costs.
• Net interest margin increased 24 basis points reflecting the benefit of higher yields on interestearning assets.
• Noninterest income decreased $411 million, or 7%, and included lower merger and acquisition advisory
activity and trading revenue, as well as a decline in private equity revenue. The decrease also included
negative Visa Class B fair value adjustments of $179 million for the first nine months of 2023 compared to
$1 million of positive adjustments for the same period in 2022.
• Provision for credit losses of $510 million for the first nine months of 2023 included the impact of our updated
economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality. The first nine months of 2022 included a
provision for credit losses of $69 million.
• Noninterest expense increased $242 million, or 2%, due to higher personnel costs, an increased FDIC assessment
rate and higher marketing and equipment costs to support business growth.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.
Balance Sheet Highlights
Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at September 30, 2023. In comparison to December 31, 2022:
• Total assets of $557.3 billion were stable.
• Total loans decreased $7.6 billion, or 2%, to $318.4 billion.
• Total commercial loans decreased $8.6 billion, or 4%, to $216.4 billion, driven by paydowns outpacing new
production and lower utilization of loan commitments.
• Total consumer loans increased $1.0 billion to $102.0 billion as a result of growth in residential mortgages, home
equity and automobile loans, partially offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new
originations and draws on existing accounts.
• Investment securities decreased $6.9 billion, or 5%, to $132.4 billion primarily due to prepayments and maturities outpacing
purchases.
• Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $14.2 billion, or 52%, to $41.5
billion primarily due to a decrease in loans and higher borrowed funds, partially offset by lower deposits.
• Total deposits decreased $12.7 billion, or 3%, to $423.6 billion as a result of lower consumer and commercial deposits,
reflecting the impact of economic pressures and continued elevated levels of consumer spending. In addition, noninterestbearing balances decreased due to the continued shift into interest-bearing deposit products as interest rates have risen.
• Borrowed funds increased $7.5 billion, or 13%, to $66.2 billion due to parent company senior debt issuances and higher
FHLB borrowings.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3 
Credit Quality Highlights
The third quarter of 2023 reflected strong credit quality performance.
• At September 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022:
• Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $203 million, or 14%, driven by lower commercial and
consumer loan delinquencies.
• The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related
commitments, totaled $5.4 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, reserves reflected our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition
and quality. ACL to total loans was 1.70% and 1.67% at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
• Nonperforming assets increased $139 million, or 7%, to $2.2 billion, driven by higher commercial real estate
nonperforming loans.
• Net charge-offs of $121 million, or 0.15% of average loans, in the third quarter of 2023 decreased $73 million compared to
the second quarter of 2023 primarily reflecting lower commercial real estate net loan charge-offs.
For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
Capital and Liquidity Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
• Common shareholders’ equity of $42.2 billion at September 30, 2023, increased $2.2 billion, or 5%, compared to
December 31, 2022 due to the benefit of net income, partially offset by common dividends paid, common share repurchases
and a decline in AOCI.
• In the third quarter of 2023, PNC returned $0.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares.
• Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum
levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase
program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 46% were still available for repurchase at
September 30, 2023. In light of the Federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital
framework, share repurchase activity was paused in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to remain paused
during the fourth quarter of 2023. PNC continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may
resume share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. PNC’s
SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
• On October 2, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.55 per share.
The dividend, with a payment date of November 5, 2023, will be payable the next business day.
• Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.8% at September 30, 2023 from 9.1% at December 31, 2022.
• PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay through December 31, 2021 the full
impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first
quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being
phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of
CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 9.7%
at September 30, 2023 compared to 8.9% at December 31, 2022.
• PNC’s average LCR for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 107% and exceeded the regulatory minimum
requirement throughout the quarter.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our
2023 liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios.
PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an
SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional
information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation
section in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account the potential impact of legal and regulatory
contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:
• Economic growth accelerated in the first half of 2023, but ongoing Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to slow
inflation is weighing on interest-rate sensitive industries. Sectors where interest rates play an outsized role, such as business
4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
investment and consumer spending on durable goods, will contract in 2024.
• PNC’s baseline outlook is for a mild recession starting in mid-2024, with a small contraction in real GDP of less than 1%,
lasting into late 2024. The unemployment rate will increase through the rest of 2023 and throughout 2024, peaking at close to
5% in early 2025. Inflation will slow with weaker demand, moving back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% objective by the second
half of 2024.
• PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term, between 5.25% and 5.50% through mid-2024, with
federal funds rate cuts starting in the third quarter of 2024 in response to the recession.
For the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter of 2023, we expect:
• Average loans to be up approximately 3%,
• Net interest income to be down 1% to 2%,
• Fee income to be up approximately 1%,
• Other noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and Visa activity, to be $150 million to $200 million,
• Noninterest expense to be up 8% to 9%,
• Core noninterest expense to be up 3% to 4%, excluding charges related to the workforce reduction of approximately $150
million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and
• Net loan charge-offs to be $200 million to $250 million.
Noninterest expense and core noninterest expense guidance does not contemplate the FDIC special assessment related to recovering
the cost of the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Reconciliation of
Core Noninterest Expense Guidance (non-GAAP) section of this Report.
We are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, without unreasonable
effort, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures except for the impact of the workforce reduction charges to
noninterest expense. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amounts necessary for the reconciliation when
such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot
address the probable significance of unavailable information.
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors
included in our first quarter 2023 Form 10-Q and 2022 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps
materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report.
Net income of $1.6 billion, or $3.60 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023 increased $70 million, or 5%, compared
to $1.5 billion, or $3.36 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower expenses and higher
noninterest income, partially offset by a decline in net interest income. Net income of $4.8 billion, or $10.94 per diluted common share
for the first nine months of 2023 increased $199 million, or 4%, compared to $4.6 billion, or $10.39 per diluted common share for the
same period in 2022 as a result of higher net interest income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses, lower noninterest
income and increased expenses.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in
Item 1 of this Report.
Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and
related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical
Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional
information.
Net interest income decreased $92 million, or 3%, for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023 as higher
yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Net interest income increased $1.2 billion, or 13%,
for the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of higher interest-earning asset yields and balances,
partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest margin decreased 8 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2023 as higher
yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Net interest margin increased 24 basis points in the
year-to-date comparison, reflecting the benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets.
Average investment securities for the third quarter of 2023 decreased $1.3 billion, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 as
limited purchase activity during the quarter was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. Average investment securities
6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
increased $6.1 billion, or 5%, in the year-to-date comparison, reflecting net securities purchases, primarily of agency residential
mortgage-backed securities. Average investment securities represented 28% of average interest-earning assets for both the third and
second quarters of 2023, and 28% for the first nine months of 2023 compared to 27% for the first nine months of 2022.
Average loans for the third quarter of 2023 decreased $5.0 billion, or 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to
lower commercial loans, partially offset by an increase in consumer loans. Average loans increased $20.2 billion, or 7%, in the yearto-date comparison, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Average loans represented 63% of average interestearning assets for the third quarter of 2023 compared to 64% for the second quarter of 2023, and 64% for the first nine months of 2023
compared to 62% for the first nine months of 2022.
Average interest-earning deposits with banks for the third quarter of 2023 increased $6.9 billion, or 22%, compared to the second
quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower loan balances. In the year-to-date comparison, average interest-earning deposits with banks
decreased $10.0 billion, or 22%, primarily due to higher loan balances and lower deposits, partially offset by higher borrowed funds.
Average interest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2023 increased $2.0 billion, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2023.
Average interest-bearing deposits for the first nine months of 2023 increased $15.8 billion, or 5%, compared to the same period in
2022. The increase in both comparisons reflected a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as deposit
rates have risen. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 82% of average interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter
of 2023 compared to 83% for the second quarter of 2023, and 83% for the first nine months of 2023 compared to 89% for the first nine
months of 2022.
Average borrowed funds increased $1.8 billion, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to parent company
senior debt issuances near the end of the second quarter. Average borrowed funds increased $28.6 billion, or 78%, in the year-to-date
comparison due to higher FHLB borrowings and parent company senior debt issuances.
Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 35% for the third quarter of 2023 compared to 34% for the second quarter of
2023, and 35% for the first nine months of 2023 compared to 39% for the same period in 2022.
Asset management and brokerage fees were stable compared to the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in the year-to-date
comparison reflected lower client activity. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management of $176 billion at September 30, 2023
were stable compared to June 30, 2023. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management increased $10 billion from $166 billion
at September 30, 2022 driven by higher spot equity markets, partially offset by client activity.
Capital markets and advisory fees decreased compared to the second quarter of 2023 driven by lower trading revenue. The decrease in
the year-to-date comparison was primarily due to lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and trading revenue.
Card and cash management revenue decreased compared to the second quarter of 2023 as increased treasury management product
revenue was more than offset by lower consumer transaction volumes. The increase compared to the first nine months of 2022 was
primarily due to higher treasury management product revenue.
Lending and deposit services increased in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, reflecting increased customer activity. In
comparison to the first nine months of 2022, the increase was also driven by growth in loan commitment fees.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7 
Residential and commercial mortgage increased compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to a $97 million increase in
mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The increase compared to the first nine months of 2022 was driven by
higher residential mortgage banking activities.
Other noninterest income decreased both in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons. Both comparisons included lower private
equity revenue and the impact of negative Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments related to the extension of anticipated
litigation resolution timing. Negative Visa Class B fair value adjustments were $51 million for the third quarter of 2023 compared to
$83 million for the second quarter of 2023. The first nine months of 2023 included negative Visa Class B fair value adjustments of
$179 million compared to $1 million of positive adjustments for the same period in 2022.

Noninterest expense decreased compared to the second quarter of 2023, reflecting a continued focus on expense management as
expenses were lower or stable across all categories. The increase compared to the first nine months of 2022 was due to higher
personnel costs, an increased FDIC assessment rate and higher marketing and equipment costs to support business growth.
See Note 17 Subsequent Events for details regarding our workforce reduction announced in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 15.5% in both the third and second quarters of 2023. The effective income tax rate was 16.1% in the
first nine months of 2023 compared to 18.4% for the same period in 2022. The third quarter of 2023 included the favorable impact of

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at September 30, 2023. In comparison to December 31, 2022:
• Total assets were stable.
• Total liabilities decreased primarily due to lower deposits, partially offset by increased borrowed funds.
• Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income and a preferred stock issuance, partially offset by dividends paid,
common share repurchases and a decline in AOCI.
The ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, reserves reflected our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality. See the
following for additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:
• Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review,
• Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review, and
• Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.

the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations and draws on existing accounts.

Investment Securities
Investment securities of $132.4 billion at September 30, 2023 decreased $6.9 billion, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2022,
primarily due to prepayments and maturities outpacing purchases.
The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to
optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

(a) Of our total securities portfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
(b) Amortized cost is presented net of the allowance for investment securities, which totaled $98 million at September 30, 2023 and primarily related to non-agency commercial
mortgage-backed securities. The comparable amount at December 31, 2022 was $149 million.
(c) Collateralized primarily by office buildings, multifamily housing, retail properties, lodging properties and industrial properties.
(d) Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.
(e) Includes state and municipal securities.
(f) Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.
Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at
September 30, 2023 was comparable to December 31, 2022 and primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation
of fixed-rate securities offset by the passage of time. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the
allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for
the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional
details regarding the allowance for investment securities.
The duration of investment securities was 4.3 years and 4.5 years at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We
estimate that at September 30, 2023 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.2 years for an immediate 50 basis points
parallel increase in interest rates and 4.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts
at December 31, 2022 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.4 years and 4.5 years, respectively.
Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.8 years at
September 30, 2023 compared to 6.0 years at December 31, 2022.

Total deposits decreased as a result of lower consumer and commercial deposits, reflecting the impact of economic pressures and
continued elevated levels of consumer spending. In addition, noninterest-bearing balances decreased due to the continued shift into
interest-bearing deposit products as interest rates have risen.
Borrowed funds increased due to parent company senior debt issuances and higher FHLB borrowings.
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan,
investment securities and deposit growth and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of
liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines
and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for
additional information regarding our liquidity and capital activities. See Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed

Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $49.5 billion at September 30, 2023, an increase of $3.7 billion compared to December 31, 2022, as
increases related to net income of $4.8 billion and a preferred stock issuance of $1.5 billion were partially offset by dividends paid of
$2.1 billion, common share repurchases of $0.5 billion and a decline in AOCI of $0.1 billion.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW
We have three reportable business segments:
• Retail Banking
• Corporate & Institutional Banking
• Asset Management Group
Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Certain amounts included in
this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial
Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding
charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing
characteristics, tenor and other factors.
Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the
“Other” category as shown in Table 79 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria
for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, including net securities gains or
losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments,
intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses
and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP).

Retail Banking
Retail Banking’s core strategy is to build lifelong, primary relationships by creating a sense of financial well-being and ease for our
clients. Over time, we seek to deepen those relationships by meeting the broad range of our clients’ financial needs across savings,
liquidity, lending, payments, investment and retirement solutions. We work to deliver these solutions in the most seamless and
efficient way possible, meeting our customers where they want to be met — whether in a branch, through digital channels, at an ATM
or through our phone-based customer contact centers — while continuously optimizing the cost to sell and service. We believe that,
over time, we can grow our customer base, enhance the breadth and depth of our client relationships and improve our efficiency
through differentiated products and leading digital channels.

Retail Banking earnings for the first nine months of 2023 increased $1.5 billion compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to
increased net interest income, partially offset by an increased provision for credit losses.
Net interest income increased in the comparison due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by narrower
interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
Noninterest income increased primarily due to growth in residential mortgage banking and lending and deposit customer-related
activities, partially offset by the impact of negative Visa Class B fair value adjustments compared to the same period in 2022.
Provision for credit losses included the impact of our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality.
Noninterest expense was relatively stable in the comparison.
Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Average consumer
loans increased driven by higher residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of new volume and draws on existing
accounts outpacing liquidations, as well as growth in credit card loans due to new account production and purchase volume increases.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 15 
The increase was partially offset by a decline in automobile, education and other consumer loans as paydowns outpaced new
originations. Average commercial loans increased due to growth in automobile dealer segment balances, partially offset by forgiveness
of PPP loans.
Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and
retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on
retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate-sensitive
customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first nine
months of 2023, average total deposits decreased compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting the impact of continued elevated
levels of consumer spending and quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve.
As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate a coast-to-coast network of retail
branches, solution centers and ATMs, which are complemented by PNC’s suite of digital capabilities.
Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for
consumers and small businesses.

(e) As of September 30.
(f) As the result of a business realignment within C&IB during the second quarter of 2023, certain loans were reclassified from Other to Corporate Banking in the prior periods
to conform to the current period presentation.
Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first nine months of 2023 decreased $52 million compared to the same period in
2022 driven by higher provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and increased noninterest expense, partially offset by
higher net interest income.
Net interest income increased in the comparison due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher average loan
balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average deposit balances.
Noninterest income decreased in the comparison driven by lower capital markets and advisory fees and lower commercial mortgage
banking activities, partially offset by growth in treasury management product revenue.
Provision for credit losses included the impact of our updated economic outlook and changes in portfolio composition and quality.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison reflecting continued investments to support business growth.
Average loans increased compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to increases in Corporate Banking, Real
Estate and Business Credit, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Banking:
• Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to
mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business increased driven
by strong new production throughout 2022 and higher average utilization of loan commitments.
• Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average
loans for this business increased largely due to new production throughout 2022, partially offset by a lower average
utilization of loan commitments.
• Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is mainly
secured by business assets. Average loans for this business increased primarily driven by new production, partially offset by
lower average utilization of loan commitments.
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller
corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined primarily driven by lower average utilization of loan
commitments, PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns outpacing new production.
The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining
relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to
provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022,
reflecting the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and included a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to
interest-bearing deposits as deposit rates have risen. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make
adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.
Following the BBVA acquisition in 2021 and our de novo expansion efforts, we are now a coast-to-coast franchise and have a
presence in the largest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. These expanded locations complement Corporate & Institutional
Banking’s existing national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and our full suite of commercial products and
services are offered nationally.
Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including
treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers
of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and
noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is
reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses
where the customer relationships exist. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for
treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services
follows.
The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and
disbursement management services, funds transfer services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information
management and reporting services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income.
Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating
18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management
customer deposit balances. Compared to the first nine months of 2022, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest
rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher product revenue.
Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and
noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total
revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison primarily due to lower commercial mortgage
servicing income driven by higher commercial MSRs amortization.
Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital
markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The decrease in
capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and lower loan
syndication fees, partially offset by higher customer-related trading revenue for derivatives, foreign exchange and fixed income.

The Asset Management Group consists of two primary businesses: PNC Private Bank and Institutional Asset Management.
The PNC Private Bank is focused on being a premier private bank in each of the markets it serves. This business seeks to deliver high
quality banking, trust and investment management services to our emerging affluent, high net worth and ultra high net worth clients
through a broad array of products and services.
20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions, and
retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies,
municipalities and non-profits.
Asset Management Group earnings in the first nine months of 2023 decreased $90 million compared to the same period in 2022,
primarily driven by lower net interest income, higher noninterest expense and a decrease in noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased in the comparison due to a decline in average deposits as well as narrower interest rate spreads on the
value of loans.
Noninterest income decreased in the comparison driven by lower asset management fees due to the impact of client activity.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison, reflecting continued investments to support business growth.
Average loans increased compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2022, driven by growth in residential real estate
lending, partially offset by a decrease in security based lending lines of credit.
Average deposits decreased in the comparison due to competitive pricing pressures as clients continue to seek higher yielding returns,
including deploying funds into discretionary client assets under management.
Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher equity markets as of
September 30, 2023.

We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and
measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan
classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.
Commercial
Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 55% and 56% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of
repayment for a loan should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets,
such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other
business assets.
We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of
the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity
in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to
monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies
that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following
table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $21.4 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $6.3 billion of
real estate construction project loans and $8.1 billion of intermediate-term financing loans as of September 30, 2023. Comparable
amounts as of December 31, 2022 were $22.3 billion, $6.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD
and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location
and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The
portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

As remote work continues to be a feasible alternative and notable portions of available space remain underutilized, real estate related
to the office sector is an area of continuing uncertainty. We continue to closely monitor and manage our office portfolio for elevated
levels of credit risk given the ongoing shift in office demand.
At September 30, 2023, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $8.6 billion, or 2.7% of total loans, while
additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.4 billion. Nonperforming loans within the office portfolio totaled 7.7% and
criticized loans within the office portfolio totaled 23.2%. At September 30, 2023, there were no office loans outstanding that were 30
or more days delinquent outside of the nonperforming category. As of September 30, 2023, we have established reserves of 8.5%
against office loans.
Our office portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. From a tenancy category perspective, 59%
of this portfolio represents multi-tenant properties at September 30, 2023, which is an area where we have noted increased stress. The
remaining 41% of the portfolio is primarily comprised of single-tenant, government tenant and medical office tenant properties.
Consumer
Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least
quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g.,
nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network.
Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with
servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we
retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $42.2 billion at
September 30, 2023, with 45% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $40.6 billion and 44%,
respectively.
Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $20.4 billion of home equity lines of credit and $5.8 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans
at September 30, 2023. Comparable amounts were $19.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Home equity
lines of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers.
Similar to residential real estate loans, we track borrower performance of this portfolio on a monthly basis. We also segment the
population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit
or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of
whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis
and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy
status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.
The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of
the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at
the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to
obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2022 were $13.7 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of
loans originated primarily through franchised dealers, including from expansion into new markets. This business is strategically
aligned with our core retail banking business.

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores
noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At September 30, 2023, the
portfolio balance was composed of 46% new vehicle loans and 54% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2022
were 50% and 50%, respectively.
The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated
FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product
channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and
monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual
principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming loans whose terms were modified as a result of a borrower’s financial
difficulty and PCD loans, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans
accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for details on our
nonaccrual policies.
The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets by major category:

(a) In connection with the adoption of ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, nonperforming
loans as of September 30, 2023 include certain loans where terms were modified as a result of a borrower’s financial difficulty. Prior period amounts included nonperforming
TDRs, for which accounting guidance was eliminated effective January 1, 2023. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing
Financial Difficulty section of Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for more information on our adoption of this ASU.
(b) Excludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.

September 30 $ 2,158 $ 2,101
As of September 30, 2023, approximately 98% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral.
Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio.
Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of
payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under
the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given
current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment resulting from
elevated inflation levels, industry specific risks, higher interest rates, declining consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural
and secular changes fostered by the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and
collection programs to assist our customers. The CARES Act credit reporting rules expired in the third quarter of 2023 and as such,
26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
delinquency status at September 30, 2023 is being reported for all loans based on the contractual terms of the loan. Amounts as of
December 31, 2022 continue to be presented in accordance with the credit reporting rules under the CARES Act, which required
certain loans modified due to pandemic-related hardships to not be reported as past due based on the contractual terms of the loan,
even when borrowers may not have made payments on their loans during the modification period.
The following table presents a summary of accruing loans past due by delinquency status:

(a) Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the
process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines,
or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
Loan Modifications
We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease
modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship
relief programs.
On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and
Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan
modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Loans and Related
Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on our adoption of this ASU.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction
characteristics. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans,
equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments and determine this allowance based on
assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional discussion of our ACL, including details of our methodologies. Also see the Critical
Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the
ACL as of September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Management
Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital
Management section of our 2022 Form 10-K.
One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical
30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
LCR for each of PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the third quarter of 2023.
Fluctuations in our average LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net
cash outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.
The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of
100%. The NSFR for each of PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the third quarter of
2023.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29 
We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These
deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits decreased to $423.6 billion at September 30, 2023 from $436.3
billion at December 31, 2022, and included a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposit products, as interest
rates have risen. As of September 30, 2023, uninsured deposits represented approximately 46% of our total deposit base. The majority
of our uninsured deposits are related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit
customers who utilize two or more PNC products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and
Business Segments Review sections of this Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB
borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review, Note 7 Borrowed
Funds included in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information related to our
borrowings.
Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

In billions 2023
January 1 $ 23.0
Issuances 7.0
Calls and maturities (2.3)
Other (0.6)
September 30 $ 27.1
Additionally, certain liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity
position. The following table summarizes our contingent liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:
Table 27: Contingent Liquidity Sources
In billions September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022

Total available contingent liquidity $ 222.9 $ 203.9
(a) Available investment securities represents the fair value of investment securities that are available for sale or that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.
Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine
months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At
September 30, 2023, PNC Bank’s remaining capacity to issue under the program was $33.3 billion.
Under PNC Bank’s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to
provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2023, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or through issuing its
senior unsecured notes.
Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the
parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases
and acquisitions.
30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
At September 30, 2023, available parent company liquidity totaled $17.4 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany
cash and investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the
maturity of parent company debt obligations.
The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may
be impacted by the following:
• Bank-level capital needs,
• Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
• Corporate policies,
• Contractual restrictions, and
• Other factors.
There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to
extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the
parent company without prior regulatory approval was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2023. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in our
2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.
In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends
and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for
the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital
instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company’s 2014 commercial paper program, the
parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2023,
there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
The following table details parent company note issuances in the third quarter of 2023:
Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued
Issuance Date Amount Description of Issuance
August 18, 2023 $750 million $750 million of senior fixed-to-floating notes with a maturity date of August 18, 2034. Interest is payable
semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.939% per annum, on February 18 and August 18 of each year,
beginning on February 18, 2024. Beginning on August 18, 2033, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a
floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest
period using the SOFR Index as described in the Prospectus Supplement), plus 1.946%, on November 18,
2033, February 18, 2034, May 18, 2034 and at the maturity date.
Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $19.6 billion and $13.1 billion at September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively.
See Note 17 Subsequent Events for details on the parent company’s issuances of $1.25 billion of its 6.615% senior fixed-to-floating
rate notes that mature on October 27, 2023 and $2.25 billion of its 6.875% senior fixed-to-floating rate notes that mature on October
20, 2034.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and
postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section
of our 2022 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we have
various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 8 Commitments.
Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative
instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset
quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the
cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item
1 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming
debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and
managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
See Note 17 Subsequent Events for details on the redemption of $1.0 billion of Series O preferred stock on November 1, 2023.
In the third quarter of 2023, PNC returned $0.6 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends on common shares. Consistent
with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels (the regulatory minimum
(4.5%) plus our SCB), our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase
program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 46% were still available for repurchase at September 30, 2023.
In light of the Federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework, share repurchase activity was paused
in the third quarter of 2023 and is expected to remain paused during the fourth quarter of 2023. PNC continues to evaluate the
potential impact of the proposed rules and may resume share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as
well as other factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
On October 2, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.55 per share. The
dividend, with a payment date of November 5, 2023, will be payable the next business day.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year
transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.
(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both
on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under
the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.
Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject
to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory
capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in
retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for
PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional
discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K.
At September 30, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and
10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 riskbased capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33 
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital
well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage
our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our September 30, 2023 capital levels were aligned with
them.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the
Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding
market risk.
Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors,
including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the
interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due
to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only
affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk
management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors.
Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 follow:
Table 31: Interest Sensitivity Analysis

Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation
Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual parallel interest rate change over the
 following 12 months of:
100 basis point increase (0.4) % 2.5 %
100 basis point decrease 0.3 % (2.5) %
Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual parallel interest rate change over the
 preceding 12 months of:
100 basis point increase (0.3) % 4.5 %
100 basis point decrease 0.1 % (4.8) %
In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the
effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the
next two twelve-month periods, assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates, and
(iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on
current base rates) scenario.
All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to
remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

First year sensitivity 0.6 % 1.3 % (0.4) %
Second year sensitivity 4.5 % 3.3 % (2.5) %
When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and
characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the
future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables
31 and 32. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then-current market rates.

The following graph presents the SOFR curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward:
Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward
The third quarter 2023 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an
increase in interest rates over the longer term and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit
funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market
conditions.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging
activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are
marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate
the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the
portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market
Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits. See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2022 Form 10-K for more
information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.
Customer-related trading revenue was $118 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $291 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to higher funding costs on the trading positions inventory and
lower derivative client sales revenues, partially offset by improved foreign exchange client revenues.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to
extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in
a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also
have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory
limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment
decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax
credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.5 billion at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2022 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit
investments.
Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid
portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity
investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. As of September 30, 2023, $1.7 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested
indirectly through various private equity funds.
Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares
that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A
common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation. Based upon the September 30, 2023
per share closing price of $230.01 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the Class B
common shares was approximately $1.3 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis
was insignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note 21 Legal Proceedings in our 2022 Form 10-K and Note 13 Legal Proceedings in
this Report for additional information regarding our Visa agreements, and Visa’s proposed amendments to its Certificate of
Incorporation to institute, if approved by stockholders, an exchange offer program that would release transfer restrictions on portions
of the Visa Class B common shares. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the shares’
limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace.
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with
both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $17 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 and $26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to
market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to
facilitate their risk management activities.
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a
notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount on these instruments.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16 Financial
Derivatives in our 2022 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be
ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Long-Term Debt Requirements
In August 2023, the federal banking agencies proposed rules that would require Category II, III, and IV bank holding companies under
the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards to issue and maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt that satisfies certain
requirements. Under the proposal, insured depository institutions of such bank holding companies would also be required to issue and
maintain long-term debt internally to a company that consolidates the insured depository institution, which in turn would be required
to purchase that long-term debt. Additionally, Category II, III, and IV bank holding companies would be subject to “clean holding
company” requirements, which would prohibit such companies from entering into certain financial arrangements and cap liabilities
that are not long-term debt and rank at either the same priority as or junior to eligible external long-term debt. PNC, as a Category III
holding company, and PNC Bank would be subject to the rules and would have a three-year phase-in period after any final rule to
achieve compliance with the long-term debt requirements. If the rules were finalized in their current form, we would expect to achieve
compliance through normal course funding.
Resolution Plan Requirements
In August 2023, the FDIC proposed changes to its rule requiring certain insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to
periodically submit a resolution plan that, in the event of a hypothetical failure, should enable the FDIC to resolve the bank under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Under the proposed rule, banks with $100 billion or more in assets, such as PNC Bank, would be
required to submit full resolution plans on a two-year cycle with an interim informational supplement and FDIC supervisory activities
and capabilities testing between full submissions. The proposed rule would significantly expand the required content elements and add
virtual data room and valuation capabilities as significant components of the resolution planning process. The proposal would divide
banks with $100 billion or more in assets into two future groups, with one group of banks required to submit their first full resolution
plan under the new rule at least 270 days after the effective date of the final rule, and the other submitting full plans the following
year.
The Federal Reserve and FDIC also proposed new guidance for holding company resolution plans submitted by triennial full filers,
such as PNC, under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations. The proposed guidance bifurcates each
area of requirements into separate sections for single point of entry and multiple point of entry resolution strategies, generally applying
—to the extent relevant to each resolution strategy—the expectations from the 2019 resolution plan guidance applicable to U.S.
GSIBs. Firms like PNC with a multiple point of entry resolution strategy would be required to incorporate more severe plan
assumptions and include new required plan content, operational capabilities, legal entity rationalization, and separability options,
among other requirements. PNC’s next 165(d) resolution plan is due July 1, 2024, unless the Federal Reserve and FDIC provide an
extension.
Other Regulatory Developments
On October 19, 2023, the CFPB proposed for public comment a rule to implement Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which
requires certain entities, including PNC and PNC Bank, to, upon request, make available to a consumer information in the entity’s
control or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity. In general, the
proposed rule would require data providers holding a consumer account, such as PNC Bank, to establish a developer interface
satisfying certain security and other standards, accept requests for specific types of data covered by the rule through the developer
interface and, in response to such a request, make that data available in electronic form to consumers and authorized third parties,
including data aggregators. Data providers could not charge consumers or third parties fees for processing these requests. The
proposed rule would also place data security, authorization, and other obligations on third parties accessing covered data from data
providers, which could include PNC and PNC Bank when acting in certain capacities. The rule would also require third parties to limit
their collection, use, and retention of the data received to only that reasonably necessary to provide the consumer’s requested product
or service. The rule would be effective for PNC and PNC Bank six months after publication of the final rule.
On October 24, 2023, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to amend the regulations implementing the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA), which requires the agencies to assess a bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of the communities in
which they do business, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The rule significantly expands the number of areas in
which a bank is evaluated, materially changes the tests used to evaluate the bank in those areas and expands the data a bank must
collect and report. We expect the rule will increase PNC Bank’s obligations and compliance costs necessary to achieve a
“Satisfactory” or “Outstanding” rating under the CRA framework, which factors into the ability of banks to expand and engage in new
activities.
On October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the three components of the interchange fee cap for a debit card
transaction received by a debit card issuer that does not qualify for a statutory exemption, such as PNC Bank. Under the proposed rule,
the base component would decrease from 21.0 to 14.4 cents, the ad valorem component would decrease from 5.0 basis points to 4.0
basis points (multiplied by the value of the transaction) and for a debit card issuer that meets certain fraud-prevention standards, the
fraud-prevention adjustment component would increase from 1.0 cents to 1.3 cents. The proposed rule would also codify an approach
to update the three components every other year. The final rule would take effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter that
begins at least 60 days after the rule is published.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022
Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or
economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and
commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2022
Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our
existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for
the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated
recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and
transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of
future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these
factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and
other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best
estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major
drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:
• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As
current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
• Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic
forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to probability weights assigned to
these scenarios and timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
• Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics,
including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially
affected.
• Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of
one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies.
Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Pursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses.
For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios
with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in
our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to
them.
To generate the four economic forecast scenarios, we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of
economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and
supportable forecast period. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within
that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution
and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected
economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each
quarter, the scenarios are presented to RAC for approval, and the committee also approves CECL scenario weights for use during the
current reporting period.
The scenarios used for the period ended September 30, 2023 consider, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the
corresponding tightening of monetary policy and credit availability. Our most-likely expectation at September 30, 2023 is that the U.S.
economy will be impacted by a mild recession starting in the first half of 2024.
We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.
unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average
scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Table 35: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios
Assumptions as of September 30, 2023
2023 2024 2025
U.S. real GDP (a) 2.1% (0.1)% 1.9%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 3.8% 4.6% 4.6%
Assumptions as of December 31, 2022
2023 2024 2025
U.S. real GDP (a) (0.4)% 1.4% 1.9%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.9% 4.9% 4.4%
(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss) rates.
(b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Real GDP growth is expected to end 2023 at 2.1% on a weighted average basis, up from the (0.4%) assumed at December 31, 2022,
primarily due to stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first half of 2023. Growth then drops to (0.1)% in 2024, before jumping to
1.9% in 2025. In line with stronger-than-anticipated job growth in 2023, the weighted-average projection of the unemployment rate is
expected to end 2023 at 3.8%, down from the 4.9% assumed at December 31,2022. The weighted-average unemployment rate is then
expected to increase through 2024, reaching 4.6% by year-end 2024, and remain flat at 4.6% through the fourth quarter of 2025.
The current state of the economy reflects an environment with receding pandemic-related risks and labor-related supply chain
pressures. However, heightened uncertainty remains due to structural and secular changes fostered by the pandemic for certain sectors
of the economy combined with inflation, rising interest rates and declining consumer savings and deposit balances. As such, for both
our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analysis around segments impacted by such
uncertainties to ensure our reserves are adequate, given our current macroeconomic expectations.
We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth
and granular analyses, we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment.
Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance
sheet date.

• Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review,
• Note 2 Investment Securities, and
• Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of September 30, 2023, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over
financial reporting.
Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) were effective as of September 30, 2023, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the third quarter of 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial
performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial
position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are
typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,”
“forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future
events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which
our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty
and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution
against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.
• Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:
– Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact
money supply, market interest rates and inflation,
– Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory
initiatives,
– Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,
– Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
– Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital
markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
– Our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
– Commodity price volatility.
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory
contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:
– Economic growth accelerated in the first half of 2023, but ongoing Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to
slow inflation is weighing on interest-rate sensitive industries. Sectors where interest rates play an outsized role,
such as business investment and consumer spending on durable goods, will contract in 2024.
– PNC’s baseline outlook is for a mild recession starting in mid-2024, with a small contraction in real GDP of less
than 1%, lasting into late 2024. The unemployment rate will increase through the rest of 2023 and throughout 2024,
peaking at close to 5% in early 2025. Inflation will slow with weaker demand, moving back to the Federal Reserve’s
2% objective by the second half of 2024.
– PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged in the near term, between 5.25% and 5.50% through
mid-2024, with federal funds rate cuts starting in the third quarter of 2024 in response to the recession.
• PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or
exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.
• PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the
scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s
balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions
(such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the
development, validation and regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use
of such models.
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results
of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could
affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These
developments could include:
– Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in
the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations and changes in accounting and reporting standards.
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or
other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices and potentially causing
reputational harm to PNC.
– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of
agreements with governmental agencies.
40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
– Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses,
including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital
management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
• Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address
environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those
presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as
well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing,
which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also
impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe
weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or
disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control
through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party
vendors and service providers specifically.
We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere
in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
