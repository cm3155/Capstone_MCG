Income Statement Highlights
Net income of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023 increased $146 million, or 9%, compared
to $1.5 billion, or $3.47 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses
and a decline in expenses, partially offset by decreased net interest income and noninterest income.
• For the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022:
• Total revenue decreased $160 million, or 3%, to $5.6 billion.
• Net interest income of $3.6 billion decreased $99 million, or 3%, driven by two fewer days in the quarter
and higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets.
2 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
• Net interest margin decreased 8 basis points to 2.84% as higher yields on interest-earning assets
were more than offset by increased funding costs.
• Noninterest income decreased $61 million, or 3%, and included lower merger and acquisition advisory
activity as well as seasonally lower consumer transaction volumes.
• Provision for credit losses of $235 million in the first quarter of 2023 included the impact of updated economic
assumptions and changes in portfolio composition and quality. The fourth quarter of 2022 included a provision for
credit losses of $408 million.
• Noninterest expense decreased $153 million, or 4%, to $3.3 billion, reflecting strong expense control and lower
personnel costs, primarily due to lower variable compensation related to decreased business activity as well as
seasonally lower benefits expense.
• We generated positive operating leverage of 2%.
Net income of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023 increased $265 million, or 19%, compared
to $1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2022, as a result of higher net interest income and
noninterest income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and increased expenses.
• For the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022:
• Total revenue increased $911 million, or 19%, to $5.6 billion.
• Net interest income increased $781 million, or 28%, as a result of higher interest-earning asset yields and
balances, partially offset by higher funding costs.
• Net interest margin increased 56 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher yields on interestearning assets.
• Noninterest income increased $130 million, or 7%, as a result of business growth across the franchise as
well as higher private equity revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower average equity markets.
• Noninterest expense increased $149 million, or 5%, due to higher personnel costs, an increased FDIC assessment
rate and continued investments in technology and marketing to support business growth.
• We generated positive operating leverage of 15%.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.
Balance Sheet Highlights
Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at March 31, 2023. In comparison to December 31, 2022:
• Total assets increased modestly, to $561.8 billion.
• Total loans remained largely stable at $326.5 billion.
• Total commercial loans increased modestly to $225.4 billion as new production and higher utilization of loan
commitments were largely offset by payoffs and maturities.
• Total consumer loans were relatively stable at $101.1 billion as increases in home equity, residential mortgages and
automobile loans were offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations.
• Investment securities decreased $1.1 billion to $138.2 billion, due to prepayments and maturities outpacing purchases,
partially offset by the favorable impact of interest rate changes on net unrealized losses for available for sale securities.
• Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $6.5 billion, or 24%, to $33.9
billion, primarily due to higher borrowed funds and deposits. In the first quarter of 2023, Interest-earning deposits with banks
also included a $1.0 billion uninsured deposit with First Republic Bank. The deposit was acquired out of First Republic
Bank's receivership on May 1, 2023, and will be repaid to PNC.
• Total deposits increased $551 million to $436.8 billion as a result of higher consumer time deposits, partially offset by
seasonally lower commercial deposits, and reflected a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposit
products as interest rates have risen.
• Borrowed funds increased $2.1 billion, or 4%, to $60.8 billion as a result of parent company senior debt issuances in January
2023.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3 
Credit Quality Highlights
The first quarter of 2023 reflected solid credit quality performance.
• At March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022:
• Nonperforming assets of $2.0 billion were stable.
• Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $164 million, or 11%, driven by lower consumer and
commercial loan delinquencies.
• The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related
commitments, totaled $5.4 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the three months ended
March 31, 2023, reserves reflected our updated economic assumptions and changes in portfolio composition and
quality. ACL to total loans was 1.66% and 1.67% at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
• Net charge-offs of $195 million, or 0.24% of average loans, in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $29 million, or 13%,
compared to $224 million, or 0.28% of average loans, for the fourth quarter of 2022, due to lower consumer and commercial
net charge-offs.
For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
Capital and Liquidity Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
• Common shareholders’ equity of $41.8 billion at March 31, 2023, increased $1.8 billion, or 4%, compared to December 31,
2022, driven by the benefit of net income and an increase in AOCI, partially offset by common dividends paid and share
repurchases during the first quarter of 2023.
• In the first quarter of 2023, PNC returned $1.0 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting $0.6 billion of dividends on
common shares and $0.4 billion of common share repurchases, representing 2.4 million shares.
• Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital returns in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum
levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase
program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 47% were still available for repurchase at
March 31, 2023. Due to recent market volatility and increased economic uncertainty, share repurchase activity is
expected to be reduced in the second quarter of 2023 compared to recent quarters. PNC continues to evaluate and
may adjust share repurchase activity, as actual amounts and timing are dependent on market and economic
conditions as well as other factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period that began October 1, 2022 is 2.9%.
• On April 3, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.50 per share
payable on May 5, 2023.
• Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.2% at March 31, 2023 from 9.1% at December 31, 2022.
• PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full
impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first
quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being
phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of
CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The CET1 fully implemented ratio was 9.1% at
March 31, 2023 compared to 8.9% at December 31, 2022.
• PNC’s average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 108% and exceeded the regulatory minimum
requirement throughout the quarter.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our
2023 liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios.
PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an
SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional
information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation
section in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies.
These statements are based on our views that:
• The economy continues to expand in the first half of 2023, but economic growth is slowing in response to the ongoing
Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to slow inflation. This has led to large increases in both short- and long-term
interest rates. With much higher mortgage rates the housing market is already in contraction, with steep drops in existing
4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
home sales and single-family housing starts, and a modest decline in house prices. Other sectors where interest rates play an
outsized role, such as business investment and consumer spending on durable goods, will contract over 2023.
• PNC’s baseline outlook is for a recession starting in the second half of 2023, with real GDP contracting less than 1% before
recovery starts in the first half of 2024 as the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in response to a deteriorating labor market
and slower inflation. The unemployment rate will increase throughout 2023, peaking at above 5% in the second half of 2024.
Inflation will slow with the recession and be back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% long-term objective by mid-2024.
• PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in May. This would bring the federal funds rate to a
range of 5.00% to 5.25% by early-May. PNC expects a federal funds rate cut of 25 basis points in early 2024 as inflation
moves toward the FOMC’s 2% long-term objective.
For the second quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2023, we expect:
• Average loans to be stable,
• Net interest income to be down 2% to 4%,
• Fee income to be stable to down 1%,
• Other noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and Visa activity, to be $200 million to $250 million,
• Revenue to be down approximately 3%,
• Noninterest expense to be up 1% to 2%, and
• Net loan charge-offs to be $200 million to $250 million.
For the full year 2023, compared to the full year of 2022, we expect:
• Average loans to be up 5% to 7%,
• Period-end loans to be up 1% to 3%,
• Revenue to be up 4% to 5%,
• Noninterest expense to be up 2% to 3%, and
• The effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.
We cannot provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to
their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amounts
necessary for the reconciliation when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our
Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors
included in this Report and in our 2022 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report.
Net income of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023 increased $146 million, or 9%, compared
to $1.5 billion, or $3.47 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to a lower provision for credit losses
and a decline in expenses, partially offset by decreased net interest income and noninterest income. Net income increased $265
million, or 19%, compared to $1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2022, as a result of higher net
interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and increased expenses.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in
Item 1 of this Report.
Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and
related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical
Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report.
Net interest income decreased $99 million, or 3%, for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by two
fewer days in the quarter and higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on interest-earning assets. Net interest income
increased $781 million, or 28%, for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, as a result of higher interest-earning
asset yields and balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest margin decreased 8 basis points compared to the fourth
quarter of 2022 as higher yields on interest-earning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs. Compared to the first
quarter of 2022, net interest margin increased 56 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher yields on interest-earning assets.
Average investment securities of $143.4 billion were relatively stable for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of
2022. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, average investment securities increased $9.5 billion, or 7%, reflecting net purchases,
primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Average investment securities represented 28% of average interest-earning
assets for the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, and 27% for the first quarter of 2022.
Average loans of $325.5 billion for the first quarter of 2023 increased $3.7 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily
driven by growth in PNC’s corporate banking business during the fourth quarter of 2022. In comparison to the first quarter of 2022,
average loans increased $34.8 billion, or 12%, reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Average loans represented
64% of average interest-earning assets for both the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, and 59% for the first quarter of
2022.
Average interest-earning deposits with banks of $34.1 billion for the first quarter of 2023, increased $3.7 billion, or 12% compared to
the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher borrowed funds and deposits. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, average
interest-earning deposits with banks decreased $28.5 billion, or 46%, primarily due to higher loans outstanding.
Average interest-bearing deposits of $315.1 billion for the first quarter of 2023 increased $13.6 billion, or 5%, and $15.5 billion, or
5%, compared to the fourth and first quarters of 2022, respectively. Both comparisons reflected a continued shift from noninterestbearing to interest-bearing deposits, as interest rates have risen. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 83% of average
interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2023, 84% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 91% for the first quarter of 2022.
6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Average borrowed funds of $63.0 billion for the first quarter of 2023 increased $3.7 billion, or 6%, compared to the fourth quarter of
2022, driven by parent company senior debt issuances in January 2023. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, average borrowed funds
increased $32.7 billion, or 108% due to increased FHLB borrowings and senior debt issuances.
Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 36% for both the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022
compared to 40% for the first quarter of 2022.
Asset management and brokerage fees increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the impact of higher average equity
markets and increased annuity sales. The decrease compared to the first quarter of 2022 reflected the impact of lower average equity
markets. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management of $177 billion at March 31, 2023 increased from $173 billion at
December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of higher spot equity markets. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management
decreased from $182 billion at March 31, 2022, driven by lower spot equity markets.
Capital markets and advisory fees decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory
fees. The increase compared to the first quarter of 2022 included higher asset backed financing, merger and acquisition advisory and
underwriting fees.
Card and cash management revenue decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting seasonally lower consumer
transaction volumes. The increase in the first quarter of 2022 comparison was primarily due to increased treasury management product
revenue and higher consumer spending.
Lending and deposit services increased compared to both the fourth and first quarters of 2022, primarily driven by increased client
activity.
Residential and commercial mortgage decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to lower results from residential mortgage
servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The increase compared to the first quarter of 2022 was driven by modestly higher
commercial and residential banking activities.
Other noninterest income increased compared to both the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2022. The increase compared to the first
quarter of 2022 included the impact of higher private equity revenue. The first quarter of 2023 included $45 million of negative Visa
Class B fair value adjustments compared to $41 million of negative adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2022, and $4 million of
positive adjustments for the first quarter of 2022.

Noninterest expense decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting strong expense control and lower personnel costs,
primarily due to lower variable compensation related to decreased business activity as well as seasonally lower benefits expense. The
increase compared to the first quarter of 2022 was due to higher personnel costs, increased technology costs and marketing to support
business growth. In both comparisons, the increase in other noninterest expense included the impact of a higher FDIC assessment rate,
which resulted in an additional $25 million of expense in the first quarter of 2023.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 17.2% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 17.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, and 17.3% for

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at March 31, 2023. In comparison to December 31, 2022:
• Total assets increased modestly, and included higher Federal Reserve Bank balances.
• Total liabilities were largely stable.
• Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income, a preferred stock issuance and an improvement in AOCI, partially
offset by dividends paid and common share repurchases.
The ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. During the three months ended March
31, 2023, reserves reflected our updated economic assumptions and changes in portfolio composition and quality. See the following

• Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review,
• Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review, and
• Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.

Investment Securities
Investment securities of $138.2 billion at March 31, 2023 decreased $1.1 billion, compared to December 31, 2022, due to prepayments
and maturities outpacing purchases, partially offset by the favorable impact of interest rate changes on net unrealized losses for
available for sale securities.
The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to
optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

(a) Of our total securities portfolio, 97% were rated AAA/AA at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
(b) Amortized cost is presented net of the allowance for investment securities, which totaled $148 million at March 31, 2023 and primarily related to non-agency commercial
mortgage-backed securities. The comparable amount at December 31, 2022 was $149 million.
(c) Collateralized primarily by office buildings, multifamily housing, retail properties, lodging properties and industrial properties.
(d) Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.
(e) Includes state and municipal securities.
(f) Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.
Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at
March 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 primarily reflected the impact of lower interest rates on the valuation of fixed rate
securities. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an
appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the
securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding the allowance for
investment securities.
The duration of investment securities was 4.4 years and 4.5 years at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We
estimate that at March 31, 2023 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel
increase in interest rates and 4.4 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at
December 31, 2022 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.4 years and 4.5 years, respectively.
Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.8 years at
March 31, 2023 compared to 6.0 years at December 31, 2022.

Total deposits increased modestly as a result of higher consumer time deposits, partially offset by seasonally lower commercial
deposits. In addition, noninterest-bearing balances decreased due to the continued shift into interest-bearing deposit products as
interest rates have risen.
Borrowed funds increased due to parent company senior debt issuances in January 2023.
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan,
investment securities and deposit growth and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of
liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines
and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for
additional information regarding our liquidity and capital activities. See Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed
Funds in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information related to our borrowings.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $49.0 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $3.2 billion compared to December 31, 2022, as
increases related to net income of $1.7 billion, a preferred stock issuance of $1.5 billion and an improvement in AOCI of $1.1 billion
were partially offset by dividends paid of $0.7 billion and common share repurchases of $0.4 billion.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW
We have three reportable business segments:
• Retail Banking
• Corporate & Institutional Banking
• Asset Management Group
Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Certain amounts included in
this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial
Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding
charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing
characteristics, tenor and other factors.
Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the
“Other” category as shown in Table 78 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria
for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, including net securities gains or
losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments,
intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses
and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP).

Retail Banking
Retail Banking’s core strategy is to build lifelong, primary relationships by creating a sense of financial well-being and ease for our
clients. Over time, we seek to deepen those relationships by meeting the broad range of our clients’ financial needs across savings,
liquidity, lending, payments, investment and retirement solutions. We work to deliver these solutions in the most seamless and
efficient way possible, meeting our customers where they want to be met – whether in a branch, through digital channels, at an ATM
or through our phone-based customer contact centers – while continuously optimizing the cost to sell and service. We believe that,
over time, we can grow our customer base, enhance the breadth and depth of our client relationships and improve our efficiency
through differentiated products and leading digital channels.

Retail Banking earnings for the first three months of 2023 increased $307 million compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due
to increased net interest income, partially offset by an increased provision for credit losses, and higher noninterest expense.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
Noninterest income was relatively stable in the comparison.
Provision for credit losses included the impact of updated economic assumptions and changes in portfolio composition and quality.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison, and included increased technology costs and higher marketing spend.
Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first three months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Average consumer
loans increased 5% driven by higher residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of new volume and draws on existing
accounts outpacing liquidations, as well as growth in credit card loans due to new account production and purchase volume increases.
The increase was partially offset by a decline in automobile, education and other consumer loans as paydowns outpaced new
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 15 
originations. Average commercial loans decreased primarily due to forgiveness of PPP loans, largely offset by growth in dealer
segment balances.
Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and
retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on
retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate sensitive
customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first three
months of 2023, average total deposits decreased compared to the same period in 2022, reflecting the impact of inflationary pressures
and competitive pricing dynamics.
As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we have established a coast-to-coast network of
retail branches, solution centers and ATMs that operate alongside PNC’s suite of digital capabilities. Over time, we plan to continue to
convert a portion of branches into solution centers, which have a distinctive layout and the capability to support transactions, sales and
advice using a combination of technology and personalized banker assistance.
Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for
consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of customers by providing a broad range of liquidity,
banking, payments and investment products.

(e) As of March 31.
Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first three months of 2023 increased $103 million compared to the same period in
2022 driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increased noninterest expense and a lower
provision recapture.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher
average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average deposit balances.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison and included higher capital markets and advisory fees and growth in treasury
management product revenue.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison due to continued investments to support business growth.
Average loans increased compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 due to increases in Corporate Banking, Real Estate and
Business Credit, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Banking:
• Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to
mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business increased driven
by strong new production throughout 2022 and higher average utilization of loan commitments.
• Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average
loans for this business increased largely due to new production throughout 2022, partially offset by a lower average
utilization of loan commitments.
• Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is relatively
high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by business assets. Average loans for this business
increased primarily driven by new production and higher utilization of loan commitments.
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller
corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined primarily driven by PPP loan forgiveness and lower
average utilization of loan commitments.
The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining
relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to
provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits decreased compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022,
reflecting the impact of competitive pricing dynamics. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make
adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.
Following the BBVA acquisition in 2021 and our de novo expansion efforts, we are now a coast-to-coast franchise and have a
presence in the largest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. These expanded locations complement Corporate & Institutional
Banking’s existing national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and our full suite of commercial products and
services are offered nationally.
Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including
treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers
of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and
noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is
reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses
where the customer relationship exists. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for
treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services
follows.
The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and
disbursement management services, funds transfer services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information
management and reporting services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income.
Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating
deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management
customer deposit balances. Compared to the first three months of 2022, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest
rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher noninterest income.
18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and
noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total
revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to a higher benefit from commercial
mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge and higher revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale,
partially offset by lower commercial mortgage servicing income.
Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital
markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The increase in
capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by higher fees and credit valuation on customer-related
derivative activities as well as asset-backed financing and underwriting fees.

Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, private real estate, cash and fixed income client
solutions, and retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients including corporations, healthcare systems,
insurance companies, unions, municipalities and non-profits.
Asset Management Group earnings in the first three months of 2023 decreased $50 million compared to the same period in 2022
primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, lower noninterest income and a decrease in net interest income.
Net interest income decreased in the comparison due to a decline in average deposits as well as narrower interest rate spreads on the
value of loans.
Noninterest income decreased in the comparison primarily attributable to the asset management fee impact from lower average equity
markets.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison reflecting continued investments to support business growth.
Discretionary client assets under management decreased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to lower equity markets as of
March 31, 2023.

Commercial
Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 56% of our total loan portfolio at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The
majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan
should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts
receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business assets.
We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of
the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity
in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to
monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies
that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following
table which provides a breakout by industry classification (classified based on the North American Industry Classification System).

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $22.2 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $6.7 billion of
real estate construction project loans and $7.1 billion of intermediate-term financing loans as of March 31, 2023. Comparable amounts
as of December 31, 2022 were $22.3 billion, $6.4 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.
We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD
and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with these types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral
location and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit
risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

As remote work continues to be a feasible alternative and notable portions of leased space remain unoccupied, real estate related to the
office sector is an area of continuing uncertainty. We continue to closely monitor and manage our office portfolio for elevated levels
of credit risk given the ongoing shift in office demand.
At March 31, 2023, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $8.9 billion, or 2.7% of total loans, while additional
unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.4 billion. Nonperforming loans totaled 3.5% of total office loans outstanding at March 31,
2023, while criticized loans totaled 20.0% of this portfolio. At March 31, 2023, 0.2% of total office loans outstanding were 30 or more
days delinquent. We have established reserves against these loans that we believe appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the
portfolio as of March 31, 2023.
Our office portfolio is well diversified geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. From a tenancy category perspective, 58%
of this portfolio represents multi-tenant properties at March 31, 2023, which is an area where we have noted increased stress. The
remaining 42% of the portfolio is comprised of single-tenant, government tenant, and medical office tenant.
Consumer
Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least
quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g.,
nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan
servicers.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network.
Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with
servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we
retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $40.9 billion at March 31,
2023 with 44% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2022 were $40.6 billion and 44%, respectively.
Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $19.9 billion of home equity lines of credit and $6.3 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans
at March 31, 2023. Comparable amounts were $19.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Home equity lines
of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers.
Similar to residential real estate loans, we track borrower performance of this portfolio on a monthly basis. We also segment the
population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, or
brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of whether we hold
such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring,
we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores,
LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.
The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of
the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at
the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to
obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

portfolio balance was composed of 48% new vehicle loans and 52% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2022
were 50% and 50%, respectively.
The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated
FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product
channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and
monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV
and term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual
principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming loans whose terms were modified as a result of a borrower’s financial
difficulty and PCD loans, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans
accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies of this Report for
details on our nonaccrual policies.

March 31 $ 2,048 $ 2,324
As of March 31, 2023, approximately 98% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral, which lessened reserve
requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses.
Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of credit quality in our loan
portfolio. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due
in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted
for under the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given
current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment resulting from rising
inflation levels, labor-related supply chain pressures, higher interest rates and structural and secular changes fostered by the pandemic.
To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection programs to assist our customers. Under
26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
the CARES Act credit reporting rules, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as
of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 based on the contractual terms of the loan, even where borrowers may not be making
payments on their loans during the modification period.
The following table presents a summary of accruing loans past due by delinquency status:

(a) Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
The decrease in accruing loans past due from December 31, 2022 was the result of lower delinquencies in both the consumer and
commercial portfolios.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the
process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines,
or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
Loan Modifications
We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease
modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship
relief programs.
On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and
Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan
modifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Loans and Related
Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on our adoption of this ASU.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction characteristics. We
maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases,
trade receivables and other financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures and determine this allowance based on assessments
of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional discussion of our ACL, including details of our methodologies. Also see the Critical
Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the
ACL as of March 31, 2023.

Total net charge-offs increased $58 million, or 42%, for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in
the comparison was attributable to higher net charge-offs in our commercial portfolio, most notably within the commercial and
industrial loan class, partially offset by lower consumer net charge-offs.

Liquidity and Capital Management
Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital
Management section of our 2022 Form 10-K.
One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical
30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
LCR for each of PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the first quarter of 2023. Fluctuations
in our average LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash
outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.
The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of
100%. The NSFR for each of PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the first quarter of 2023.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29 
We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These
deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $436.8 billion at March 31, 2023 from $436.3
billion at December 31, 2022, and included a continued shift from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposit products, as interest
rates have risen. As of March 31, 2023, uninsured deposits represented approximately 43% of our total deposit base. The majority of
our uninsured deposits are related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit
customers who utilize two or more PNC products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and
Business Segments Review sections of this Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
Additionally, certain liquid assets as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our
liquidity position.
At March 31, 2023, our liquid assets consisted of cash and due from banks and short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale
agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $43.5 billion and securities available for sale totaling
$43.2 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit
growth and balance sheet management activities. PNC pledges securities as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase
agreements and for other purposes. Pledged securities included $28.1 billion of securities held to maturity and an immaterial amount
of available for sale and trading securities.
We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB
borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review, Note 7 Borrowed
Funds included in this Report and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information related to our borrowings.
Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

In billions 2023
January 1 $ 23.0
Issuances 2.7
Calls and maturities (0.8)
Other 0.4
March 31 $ 25.3
Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine
months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At March 31,
2023, PNC Bank had $7.9 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $4.8 billion were senior notes and $3.1 billion
were subordinated notes.
PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather
as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At March 31, 2023, our unused secured
borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $72.3 billion.
In March 2023, following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the Federal Reserve created a new Bank Term
Funding Program as an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities. The program offers loans of up to one year in
length to eligible depository institutions, including PNC Bank, pledging certain qualifying assets as collateral, provided that such
collateral was owned by the borrower as of March 12, 2023. See the Recent Regulatory Developments section in this Financial
Review and Item 1A Risk Factors for further detail on the risks related to the recent turmoil in the financial services industry and
responsive measures to manage it.
PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At March 31, 2023, there
were no issuances outstanding under this program.
30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank, or through issuing its
senior unsecured notes.
Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the
parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases
and acquisitions.
At March 31, 2023, available parent company liquidity totaled $13.9 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash
and investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the
maturity of parent company debt obligations.
The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may
be impacted by the following:
• Bank-level capital needs,
• Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
• Corporate policies,
• Contractual restrictions, and
• Other factors.
There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to
extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the
parent company without prior regulatory approval was $3.6 billion at March 31, 2023. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes
To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.
In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends
and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for
the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital
instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Authorized by the Board of Directors, the parent company has the
ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At March 31, 2023, there were no commercial
paper issuances outstanding.
The following table details Parent Company note issuances in the first quarter of 2023:
Table 27: Parent Company Notes Issued

beginning on July 26, 2023. Beginning on January 26, 2026, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a
floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest
period using the SOFR Index as described in the Prospectus Supplement), plus 1.085%, on April 26, 2026,
July 26, 2026, October 26, 2026, and at the maturity date.
January 19, 2023 $1.5 billion $1.5 billion of senior fixed-to-floating notes with a maturity date of January 24, 2034. Interest is payable
semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.068% per annum, on January 24 and July 24 of each year,
beginning on July 24, 2023. Beginning on January 24, 2033, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a
floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest
period using the SOFR Index, plus 1.933% on April 24, 2033, July 24, 2033, October 24, 2033 and at the
maturity date.
Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $16.0 billion and $13.1 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and
postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section
of our 2022 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business we have
various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 8 Commitments.
Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative
instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31 
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset
quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the
cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.
The following table presents credit ratings for PNC and PNC Bank as of March 31, 2023:

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item
1 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming
debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and
managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
On February 7, 2023, PNC issued 1,500,000 depositary shares each representing 1/100th ownership in a share of 6.250% fixed-rate
reset non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series W, with a par value of $1 per share.
In the first quarter of 2023, PNC returned $1.0 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting $0.6 billion of dividends on common shares
and $0.4 billion of common share repurchases, representing 2.4 million shares. Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for
capital return of amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under
the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 47% were still available for
repurchase at March 31, 2023. Due to recent market volatility and increased economic uncertainty, share repurchase activity is
expected to be reduced in the second quarter of 2023 compared to recent quarters. PNC continues to evaluate and may adjust share
repurchase activity, as actual amounts and timing are dependent on market and economic conditions as well as other factors. PNC's
SCB for the four-quarter period that began October 1, 2022 is 2.9%.
On April 3, 2023, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.50 per share payable on May
5, 2023.
On April 5, 2023, PNC submitted its 2023 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. We
anticipate that the Federal Reserve will provide the updated SCB requirement on a preliminary basis to PNC by June 30, 2023. The
updated SCB will become effective October 1, 2023. Refer to the Supervision and Regulation section in our 2022 Form 10-K for
additional information on CCAR and the SCB framework.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year
transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.
(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and excludes the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both
on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under
the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.
Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, financial difficulty modifications, past due exposures and equity
exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory
capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in
retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for
PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional
discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2022 Form 10-K.
At March 31, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and
10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 riskbased capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital
well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33 
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage
our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our March 31, 2023 capital levels were aligned with them.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the
Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management Section in our 2022 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding
market risk.
Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors,
including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the
interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due
to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only
affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which
are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 follow:

Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the
 preceding 12 months of:
100 basis point increase 1.3 % 7.3 %
100 basis point decrease (a) (1.8) % N/A
(a) Due to the prevailing low interest rate environment post pandemic, the reporting of Net interest income sensitivities for the 100 basis point decrease scenario was suspended
from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2022.
In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the
effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 31 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the
next two 12-month periods, assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and
(iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on
current base rates) scenario.
All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to
remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and
characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the
future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables
30 and 31. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then-current market rates.

Table 32: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward
The first quarter 2023 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an
increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance
sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.
LIBOR Transition
The scheduled cessation of the requirement that banks submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after June 30, 2023 presents risks to
the financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate. For more discussion regarding the
transition from LIBOR, see Item 1 Risk Factors and the Risk Management section in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2021, PNC Bank ceased entering into new contracts with a LIBOR reference rate, except on a limited basis, as
permissible. PNC is offering conforming adjustable-rate mortgages using SOFR instead of USD LIBOR, in line with Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac requirements, nonconforming adjustable-rate residential mortgages using SOFR and private education loans using Prime.
Alternative rates, primarily SOFR and BSBY, are currently offered to our corporate and commercial customers. The focus for all lines
of business is planning for the cessation event in June 2023 and client communication and outreach.
The Federal Reserve adopted a final rule effective February 27, 2023 that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate LIBOR Act (the
“LIBOR Act”) by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30,
2023. The final rule identifies replacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month,
and 12-month LIBOR contracts subject to the LIBOR Act. These contracts include U.S. contracts that do not mature before
publication of LIBOR ends June 30, 2023, and that lack adequate fallback provisions that would replace LIBOR with a practicable
replacement benchmark rate.
In addition to the previously announced transition of PNC’s Series O, Series R and Series S preferred stock to three-month CME Term
SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% per annum (“Adjusted 3-Month CME Term SOFR”), PNC will also rely on the
LIBOR Act and its implementing regulations to transition the calculation of interest on the junior subordinated debentures issued by
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and owned by PNC Capital Trust C, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc., as well as the calculation of distributions on the trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust
C. Adjusted 3-Month CME Term SOFR will be the replacement reference rate and will be used with respect to interest or distribution
periods, as applicable, with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023. Further, two series of debt securities issued by a
predecessor banking subsidiary, National City Bank, will also rely on the LIBOR Act to transition the calculation of interest. The
National City Bank Notes due April 1, 2043 will use Adjusted 3-Month CME Term SOFR as the replacement reference rate for
interest periods with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023. The National City Bank Notes due April 1, 2037 will use onemonth CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.11448% per annum as the replacement reference rate with respect to
interest periods with determination dates occurring after June 30, 2023.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35 
PNC is actively working to address other contracts without sufficient fallbacks in advance of LIBOR cessation; however, PNC does
expect to leverage the LIBOR Act for its intended purpose to address difficult exposures when necessary. We anticipate these
exposures to be a small subset of our overall portfolio.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging
activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are
marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities.We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate
the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the
portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market
Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits.
See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2022 Form 10-K for more information on our
models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process. Customer-related trading revenue was $84 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023, compared to $88 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower
derivative client sales revenue, offset by increases in client related trading results.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to
extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in
a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also
have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory
limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment
decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.
A summary of our equity investments follows:
Table 33: Equity Investments Summary
March 31
2023
December 31

Change
Dollars in millions $ %
Tax credit investments $ 4,056 $ 4,308 $ (252) (6) %
Private equity and other 4,267 4,129 138 3 %
Total $ 8,323 $ 8,437 $ (114) (1) %
Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax
credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
of our 2022 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit investments.
Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid
portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity
investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. As of March 31, 2023, $1.8 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested
indirectly through various private equity funds.
Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares
that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A
common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation. Based upon the March 31, 2023 per
share closing price of $225.46 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the Class B common
shares was approximately $1.3 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was
insignificant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
our 2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of
the Visa B common shares given the shares’ limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace.
36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with
both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $21 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 and $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.
Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to
market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to
facilitate their risk management activities.
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a
notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount on these instruments.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16 Financial
Derivatives in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2022 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note
12 Financial Derivatives.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be
ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.
RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Bank Failures and Resolutions
Following the bank failures in March 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, California, and Signature Bank, New York, New
York, and after recommendations by the boards of the FDIC and Federal Reserve and a determination by the Secretary of the Treasury
in consultation with the President, the FDIC invoked the systemic risk exception to certain resolution-related and Deposit Insurance
Fund restrictions in order to fully protect all depositors of both institutions, including uninsured deposits. By law, any losses to the
Deposit Insurance Fund to support uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception must be recovered by one or more special
assessments on insured depository institutions or depository institution holding companies, or both. The FDIC has not yet announced
the amount or timeline of any special assessments.
The Federal Reserve also created a new Bank Term Funding Program as an additional source of liquidity against high-quality
securities in order to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions. This program offers loans of up to one year
in length to eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying
assets as collateral, provided that such collateral was owned by the borrower as of March 12, 2023. These pledged assets will be
valued at par under the Program. Eligible institutions can request advances under the Program at least through March 11, 2024.
Other Developments
In February 2023, the CFPB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the rules under the Truth in Lending Act governing
credit card late fees that could reduce credit card fee income for credit card issuers, including PNC Bank. Among other things, the
proposed rule would lower the safe harbor dollar amount for credit card late fees that issuers can charge to $8 regardless of whether
the late payment is the initial or a subsequent late payment from $30 for an initial late payment and $41 for subsequent late payments.
The proposal also would eliminate the inflation adjustment to the safe harbor and cap late fees at 25% of the consumer’s required
minimum payment. The proposal also seeks comment on, among other things, whether to eliminate the safe harbor or to require a
grace period of 15 calendar days before a card issuer can impose a late fee.
In February 2023, the SEC proposed changes to the rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 governing the custody of client
assets that would increase the obligations of registered investment advisers, such as PNC Investments, PNC Capital Advisors, LLC,
and PNC TC, LLC and impact PNC Bank in its role as custodian for the clients of registered investment advisers. Among other things,
the proposal would expand the current custody rule to apply to additional advisory activities and all client assets held in advisory
accounts. Investment advisers with custody of client assets would be required to maintain them with a qualified custodian and enter
into a written agreement and receive certain assurances from the qualified custodian regarding custodial protections. Qualified
custodians would be required to hold client cash off-balance sheet, potentially reducing the liquidity available for bank lending and
other activities. The SEC also has proposed rules and rule changes that would impose new obligations on registered broker-dealers and
registered investment advisers with respect to cybersecurity and safeguarding of customer information, as well as mandatory swing
pricing of mutual fund shares and a hard close for transacting in fund shares that would fundamentally change current industry
practices.
In March 2023, the CFPB finalized its rule to implement small business data collection under Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The final rule introduces substantial data collection and reporting requirements for small business lenders, including PNC Bank, in
connection with credit applications by small businesses, which impose significant compliance and operational risks and costs. Under
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 37 
the final rule, PNC Bank must begin collecting certain prescribed information from small business credit applicants by no later than
October 1, 2024, and begin reporting such data to the CFPB by June 1, 2025.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2022
Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or
economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and
commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2022
Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our
existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for
the remaining contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated recoveries.
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction
characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future
conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to
estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods
used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best estimate of expected
losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major drivers of ACL
estimates include, but are not limited to:
• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As
current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
• Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic
forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Change to probability weights assigned to these
scenarios and timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
• Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics,
including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially
affected.
• Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of
one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies.
Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Under the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For
this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with
associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in our
reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.
To generate the four economic forecast scenarios we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of
economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and
supportable forecast period. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) in order to represent our current expectation
within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle
evolution and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of
expected economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans and securities. Each quarter the
scenarios are presented to RAC for approval, and the committee determines and approves CECL scenarios’ weights for use for the
current reporting period.
The scenarios used for the period ended March 31, 2023 reflect an increase in downside risk compared to December 31, 2022. The
current outlook considers ongoing inflationary pressures, along with the projected impacts of the recent stress on the banking industry.
Our most-likely expectation at March 31, 2023 is that the U.S. economy will be impacted by a mild recession in the second half of the
year.
38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.
unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average
scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.
Table 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios
Assumptions as of March 31, 2023
2023 2024 2025
U.S. real GDP (a) 0.4% 0.3% 1.9%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.1% 5.0% 4.4%
Assumptions as of December 31, 2022
2023 2024 2025
U.S. real GDP (a) (0.4)% 1.4% 1.9%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.9% 4.9% 4.4%
(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss) rates.
(b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Real GDP growth is expected to end 2023 at 0.4% on a weighted average basis, up from the (0.4%) assumed at December 31, 2022
due primarily to stronger economic activity at the start of 2023. Growth then drops narrowly to 0.3% in 2024, before jumping to 1.9%
in 2025. In line with stronger-than-anticipated job growth at the start of 2023, the weighted-average projection of the unemployment
rate is expected to end 2023 at 4.1%, down from the 4.9% assumed at December 31, 2022. In line with the slowing in overall
economic activity, the weighted average unemployment rate is expected to increase throughout 2023 and 2024, peaking at 5.0% by
year-end 2024, and gradually improving to 4.4% by the fourth quarter of 2025.
The current state of the economy reflects an environment with receding COVID-19 related risks, but heightened uncertainty remains
due to structural and secular changes fostered by the pandemic for certain sectors of the economy combined with inflation, rising
interest rates and ongoing labor-related supply chain pressures. As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC
identified and performed significant analysis around segments impacted by such uncertainties to ensure our reserves are adequate,
given our current macroeconomic expectations.
We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth
and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment.
Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance
sheet date.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of March 31, 2023, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including
the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over
financial reporting.
Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) were effective as of March 31, 2023, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the first quarter of 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial
performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial
position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are
typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,”
“forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future
events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which
our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty
and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution
against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.
• Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:
40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
– Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact
money supply, market interest rates and inflation,
– Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory
initiatives,
– Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,
– Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
– A continuation of recent turmoil in the banking industry, responsive measures to mitigate and manage it and related
supervisory and regulatory actions and costs,
– Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital
markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
– PNC’s ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
– Commodity price volatility.
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory
contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:
– The economy continues to expand in the first half of 2023, but economic growth is slowing in response to the
ongoing Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening to slow inflation. This has led to large increases in both shortand long-term interest rates. With much higher mortgage rates the housing market is already in contraction, with
steep drops in existing home sales and single-family housing starts, and a modest decline in house prices. Other
sectors where interest rates play an outsized role, such as business investment and consumer spending on durable
goods, will contract over 2023.
– PNC’s baseline outlook is for a recession starting in the second half of 2023, with real GDP contracting less than 1%
before recovery starts in the first half of 2024 as the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in response to a
deteriorating labor market and slower inflation. The unemployment rate will increase throughout 2023, peaking at
above 5% in the second half of 2024. Inflation will slow with the recession and be back to the Federal Reserve’s 2%
long-term objective by mid-2024.
– PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in May. This would bring the federal funds
rate to a range of 5.00% to 5.25% by early-May. PNC expects a federal funds rate cut of 25 basis points in early
2024 as inflation moves toward the FOMC’s 2% long-term objective.
• PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or
exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.
• PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, our financial performance, the scope and
terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In
addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital
distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and
regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results
of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could
affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain employees. These
developments could include:
– Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in
the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations, and changes in accounting and reporting standards.
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or
other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices, and potentially causing
reputational harm to PNC.
– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of
agreements with governmental agencies.
– Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses,
including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital
management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
• Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address
environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those
presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 41 
well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing,
which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also
impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe
weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or
disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control
through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party
vendors and service providers specifically.
We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere
in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
