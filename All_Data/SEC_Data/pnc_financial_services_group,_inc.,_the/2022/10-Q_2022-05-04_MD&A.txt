FINANCIAL REVIEW
THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

This Financial Review, including the Consolidated Financial Highlights, should be read together with our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and unaudited Statistical Information included
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Report or Form 10-Q) and with Items 6, 7, 8 and 9A of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2021 Form 10-K). We have reclassified certain prior
period amounts to conform with the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding certain business,
regulatory and legal risks, see the following: the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and of Item 7 in our 2021 Form 10-K; Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2021 Form 10-K; and the
Commitments and Legal Proceedings Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report and Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K. Also, see the Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in this Financial Review and in our 2021 Form 10-K for certain other
factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ, perhaps materially, from historical performance and from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this Report. See Note
14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to total PNC consolidated net income as reported on a
GAAP basis. In this Report, “PNC”, “we” or “us” refers to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (except when referring to PNC as a public company, its
common stock or other securities issued by PNC, which just refer to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.). References to The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. or to any of its subsidiaries are

K.

Presentation of Noninterest Income

Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC updated the presentation of its noninterest income categorization to be based on product and service type, and accordingly, has
changed the basis of presentation of its noninterest income revenue streams to: (i) Asset management and brokerage, (ii) Capital markets related, (iii) Card and cash
management, (iv) Lending and deposit services, (v) Residential and commercial mortgage and (vi) Other noninterest income. For a description of each updated noninterest
income revenue stream, see Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report.

Discussion of Results of Operations

In accordance with the SEC's current rules, PNC has elected to include a linked quarter comparison in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations, beginning in the
first quarter of 2022. The new presentation, which will provide meaningful analysis to assess quarterly performance, is reflected in the Consolidated Financial Highlights,
Executive Summary and Consolidated Income Statement Review sections of this Financial Review.

Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.

On June 1, 2021, PNC acquired BBVA USA Bancshares Inc. (BBVA), a U.S. financial holding company conducting its business operations primarily through its U.S. banking
subsidiary, BBVA USA. PNC paid $11.5 billion in cash as consideration for the acquisition.

On October 8, 2021, BBVA USA merged into PNC Bank. On October 12, 2021, PNC converted approximately 2.6 million customers, 9,000 employees and over 600 branches
across seven states. Our results for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 reflect the benefit of BBVA's acquired business operations. PNC's balance
sheets at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 include BBVA's balances.

For additional information on the acquisition of BBVA, see Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1
of this Report and Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K.

Income Statement Highlights

Net income of $1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2022 increased $123 million, or 9%, compared to $1.3 billion, or $2.86 per diluted
common share for the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by lower integration costs and well-controlled expenses.

•

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021:

•

Total revenue decreased $435 million, or 8%, to $4.7 billion.

•

•

•

Net interest income of $2.8 billion decreased $58 million, or 2%, as increased securities balances, loans outstanding and securities yields were more
than offset by a decline in PPP loan interest income and two fewer days in the quarter.

•

Net interest margin increased 1 basis point to 2.28%.

Noninterest income decreased $377 million, or 17%, to $1.9 billion, primarily due to declines in capital markets related fees, private equity revenue
and commercial mortgage banking activities.
Provision recapture was $208 million for the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the impacts from improved COVID-19 related economic
conditions. Provision recapture was $327 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.

•

Noninterest expense decreased $619 million, or 16%, to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by lower integration expenses, personnel costs and seasonally lower
business activity.

Net income decreased $397 million, or 22%, compared to $1.8 billion, or $4.10 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of higher expenses
and a lower provision recapture, partially offset by higher net interest income.

•

For the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021:

•

Total revenue increased $472 million, or 11%, reflecting the addition of BBVA.

•

•

Net interest income increased $456 million, or 19%, as a result of higher interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower securities and loan yields.

•

Net interest margin increased 1 basis point.

Noninterest income increased $16 million, primarily due to the addition of BBVA customers, higher treasury management product revenue and
increased asset management and brokerage fees, partially offset by a decline in advisory and underwriting fees and lower private equity revenue.

•

Noninterest expense increased $598 million, or 23%, primarily driven by the addition of BBVA operating expenses.

For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.

Balance Sheet Highlights

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In comparison to December 31, 2021:

•
•

•

•

•

•

Total assets decreased $15.9 billion, or 3%, to $541.2 billion.
Total loans increased $6.1 billion, or 2%, to $294.5 billion.

•

•

Total commercial loans increased $5.2 billion, or 3%, to $198.3 billion, driven by increased utilization of loan commitments and new production, partially
offset by PPP loan forgiveness.

•

PPP loans outstanding were $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Total consumer loans increased $0.9 billion to $96.2 billion, resulting from increased originations of residential mortgages and home equity loans, partially
offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new originations.

Investment securities decreased $0.6 billion to $132.4 billion, as net purchases during the quarter were more than offset by net unrealized losses on available for sale
securities, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates.
Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $25.5 billion, or 34%, to $48.8 billion, due to securities purchases, lower
deposits and borrowed funds and higher loans outstanding.
Total deposits decreased $7.1 billion, to $450.2 billion as a result of lower commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal declines, partially offset by consumer deposit
growth.
Borrowed funds decreased $4.2 billion, or 14%, to $26.6 billion, primarily due to lower bank notes and senior debt.

For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.

Credit Quality Highlights

Overall credit quality metrics strengthened during the first quarter of 2022.

•

At March 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021:

•
•

•

Nonperforming assets of $2.3 billion decreased $182 million, or 7%, driven by lower commercial nonperforming loans.
Overall loan delinquencies of $1.7 billion decreased $286 million, or 14%, driven by lower consumer and commercial delinquencies, which reflect progress in
resolving BBVA conversion-related administrative and operational delays.
The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments, decreased to $5.2 billion, or 1.76% of total
loans, at March 31, 2022, compared to $5.5 billion, or 1.92% of total loans at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by the impacts from
improved COVID-19 related economic conditions.

•

Net charge-offs of $137 million, or 0.19% of average loans in the first quarter of 2022 increased $13 million, or 10%, compared to $124 million, or 0.17% of average
loans, for the fourth quarter of 2021.

For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.

Capital Highlights
We maintained our strong capital position.

•

•

•

•

Common shareholders' equity of $44.2 billion at March 31, 2022, decreased $6.5 billion, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2021 as net income was more than offset by
a decrease in AOCI, primarily reflecting the impact of higher rates on net unrealized securities losses, as well as share repurchases and dividends paid in the first quarter.
In the first quarter, we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through common share repurchases of $1.2 billion, representing 6.4 million shares, and dividends
on common shares of $0.5 billion.

•

The SCB framework allows for capital returns in amounts up to the level of capital in excess of the SCB minimum. Consistent with the flexibility provided
under the SCB framework, our Board of Directors has recently authorized a new share repurchase structure, under the already approved authorization for
repurchases of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 64% were still available at March 31, 2022. This structure allows for the continuation
of our recent quarterly average share repurchase levels as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant.

On April 1, 2022, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.50 per share, an increase of $0.25 per share, or 20%, effective
with the May 5, 2022 dividend payment.
Our CET1 ratio decreased to 9.9% at March 31, 2022 from 10.3% at December 31, 2021.

•

Capital was impacted by our election to delay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition
period. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at
the balance sheet date, excluding the initial allowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter

4    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital over the next three
years.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2022 liquidity and capital actions as well as
our capital ratios.

PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB established by the Federal Reserve
Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial
Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K.

Business Outlook

Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking financial
statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account
potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:

•

•

•

•

•

The U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic-caused recession in the first half of 2020. Growth is likely to remain above the economy's long-run average
throughout this year. Consumer spending growth will remain solid in 2022 due to good underlying fundamentals.
Supply chain difficulties will gradually ease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages will remain a constraint this year, although strong wage growth will support
consumer spending.
Inflation accelerated in the second half of 2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to strong demand but limited supplies coming out of the pandemic for some goods and
services. Higher energy prices are adding to inflationary pressures in the first half of 2022. Inflation will slow in the second half of 2022 as pandemic-related supply and
demand imbalances recede and energy prices stabilize. However, inflation will also broaden throughout the economy due to wage growth. The annual inflation rate will
end 2022 above the Federal Reserve's long-run objective of 2%.
PNC expects the FOMC to raise the fed funds rate by 0.50% in May, 0.25% in June, 0.50% in July, 0.25% in September and 0.25% in December to reach a range of
2.00% to 2.25% by the end of the year. The FOMC will then further increase the fed funds rate in 2023. Also, the Federal Reserve will start to reduce its balance sheet in
the next few months.
Uncertainty about the outlook has increased with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has created additional risk to higher inflation this year, which could lead the FOMC
to tighten more aggressively than currently anticipated. In addition, risks to growth and the likelihood of a recession in late 2022 or 2023 have increased.

For the second quarter of 2022, compared to the first quarter of 2022, we expect:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Average loans to be up 2% to 3%,
Net interest income to be up 10% to 12%,
Noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and Visa activity, to be up 6% to 8%,
Revenue to be up 9% to 11%,
Noninterest expense to be up 3% to 5%, and
Net loan charge-offs to be between $125 million and $175 million.

For the full year 2022, compared to full year 2021, we expect:
Average loans to be up approximately 10%,
Period-end loans to be up approximately 5%,
Revenue to be up 9% to 11%,
Noninterest expense, excluding integration expense, to be up 4% to 6%, and
The effective tax rate to be 19%.

See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2021 Form 10-K for other factors that
could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW

Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

Net income of $1.4 billion, or $3.23 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2022 increased $123 million, or 9%, compared to $1.3 billion, or $2.86 per diluted
common share for the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by lower integration costs and well-controlled

expenses. Net income decreased $397 million, or 22%, compared to $1.8 billion, or $4.10 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of higher
expenses and a lower provision recapture, partially offset by higher net interest income.

Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on
a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This
adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited)
section in Item 1 of this Report.

Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and
related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis
section of this Report for additional information.

Net interest income decreased $58 million, or 2%, for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as increased securities balances, loans outstanding and
securities yields were more than offset by a decline in PPP loan interest income and two fewer days in the quarter. Net interest income increased $456 million, or 19%, for the
first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of higher interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower securities and loan yields. Net interest margin
increased 1 basis point in both comparisons.

Average investment securities of $133.9 billion for the first quarter of 2022 increased $6.0 billion, or 5%, and $47.5 billion, or 55%, compared to the fourth and first quarters of
2021, respectively. The increase in both comparisons reflected securities purchases, primarily of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities. Compared to the first quarter
of 2021, the increase was also attributable to the addition of BBVA. Average investment securities represented 27% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of
2022, 26% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 21% for the first quarter of 2021.

Average loans of $290.7 billion for the first quarter of 2022 increased $1.8 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, due to growth in commercial loans, driven by
increased utilization of loan commitments and new production, primarily within PNC's corporate banking and business credit businesses, partially offset by continued PPP loan
forgiveness. In comparison to the first quarter of 2021, average loans increased $52.6 billion, or 22%, reflecting the BBVA acquisition and commercial loan growth, partially
offset by PPP loan forgiveness. Average loans represented 59% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2022, 58% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 57% for
the first quarter of 2021.

Average interest-earning deposits with banks of $62.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022, decreased $12.8 billion, or 17%, and $22.9 billion, or 27%, compared to the fourth
and first quarters of 2021, respectively. The decrease in both comparisons reflected the impact of securities purchases, lower borrowed funds and higher loans outstanding. In
comparison to the first quarter of 2021, the decrease was partially offset by higher customer deposits.

Average interest-bearing deposits of $299.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022 increased $3.3 billion, or 1%, and $47.5 billion, or 19%, compared to the fourth and first quarters
of 2021, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, the increase was driven by growth in consumer deposits, partially offset by commercial deposit outflows. The
increase in the first quarter 2021 comparison was primarily attributable to the BBVA acquisition. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 91% of average interest-
bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2022, 90% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 88% for the first quarter of 2021.

Average borrowed funds of $30.3 billion for the first quarter of 2022 decreased $4.0 billion, or 12%, and $4.9 billion, or 14%, compared to the fourth and first quarters of 2021,
respectively, reflecting lower bank notes and senior debt.

Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 40% for the first quarter of 2022 and 44% for the fourth and first quarters of 2021.

Asset management and brokerage fees decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of lower average equity markets. The increase compared to the
first quarter of 2021 was due to higher average equity markets and the benefit of BBVA. PNC's discretionary client assets under management of $182 billion at March 31, 2022
decreased from $192 billion at December 31, 2021, largely driven by lower spot equity markets. Compared to March 31, 2021, PNC's discretionary client assets under
management increased $9 billion, primarily due to the addition of BBVA and higher spot equity markets.

Capital markets related revenue decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower merger and acquisition advisory fees. The decrease in the first quarter
of 2021 comparison was attributable to lower credit valuation on customer-related derivatives activities, a decline in advisory business activity and lower underwriting fees.

Card and cash management revenue decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to seasonally lower transaction volumes and activity and increased
compared to the first quarter of 2021, due to the addition of BBVA customers and higher treasury management product revenue.

Lending and deposit services decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 as a result of lower loan commitment fees due to higher utilization rates and increased compared
to the first quarter of 2021 due to the benefit of BBVA.

Residential and commercial mortgage decreased in both comparisons reflecting lower revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities.

Other noninterest income decreased in both comparisons, primarily due to lower private equity revenue. Additionally, the first quarter of 2022 included a net securities loss of
$4 million compared to a net securities gain of $25 million in the first quarter of 2021.

Noninterest expense decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by lower integration expenses, personnel costs and seasonally lower business activity in the first
quarter of 2022. The increase compared to the same period of 2021 was largely driven by the addition of BBVA operating expenses.

Effective Income Tax Rate

The effective income tax rate was 17.3% in the first quarter of 2022, compared to 21.5% and 16.9% in the fourth and first quarters of 2021, respectively. The decrease compared
to the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by higher tax benefits associated with increased credits and equity-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of
2022.

Our balance sheet was strong and well-positioned at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Total assets decreased reflecting lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank.
Total liabilities decreased largely due to lower commercial deposits and lower borrowed funds, primarily bank notes and senior debt, partially offset by consumer deposit
growth.
Total equity decreased as net income was more than offset by lower AOCI, primarily reflecting the impact of higher rates on net unrealized securities losses, share
repurchases and dividends paid on common and preferred stock.

•

The ACL related to loans totaled $5.2 billion at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $0.3 billion since December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the impacts from improved COVID-
19 related economic conditions. See the following for additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:

Commercial loans increased driven by increased utilization of loan commitments and new production, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness. PPP loans outstanding were $1.8
billion and $3.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

For commercial and industrial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography and property type, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit
Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.

Consumer loans grew primarily due to increases in residential mortgages and home equity, partially offset by declines in remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced new
originations.

For information on our residential real estate and home equity portfolios, including loans by geography, and our auto loan portfolio, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and
Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.

For additional information regarding our loan portfolio see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 1 and Note 4 Loans and Related
Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Investment Securities

Investment securities of $132.4 billion at March 31, 2022 decreased $0.6 billion, or less than 1%, compared to December 31, 2021, resulting from unrealized losses on available
for sale securities, partially offset by net purchase activity.

The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance
sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other
activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

Includes state and municipal securities.
Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.

Table 8 presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value, as well as by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information
because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or
decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. We continually monitor the credit risk in our
portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining
contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 3 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of
this Report for additional details regarding the allowance for investment securities.

On March 31, 2022 we transferred U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of $18.7 billion from
available for sale to held to maturity. We changed our intent and committed to hold these high-quality securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on
AOCI and tangible capital. See Note 3 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for additional details
regarding this transfer.

In April and May 2022, we transferred an additional $50.2 billion of available for sale securities to held to maturity. See Note 16 Subsequent Events in the Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional details on these transfers.

The duration of investment securities was 4.2 years at March 31, 2022. We estimate that at March 31, 2022 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.2 years for an
immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 4.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December
31, 2021 for the effective duration of investment securities were 3.8 years and 3.5 years, respectively.

Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5 years at March 31, 2022 compared to 4.4 years at
December 31, 2021.

Total deposits decreased as a result of lower commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal declines, partially offset by consumer deposit growth.

Borrowed funds decreased primarily due to lower bank notes and senior debt.

The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth, and
capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and NSFR
requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2022 liquidity and capital
activities. See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information related to our
borrowings.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity was $49.2 billion at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $6.5 billion compared to December 31, 2021 as net income of $1.4 billion was more than offset by
lower AOCI of $6.1 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of higher rates on net unrealized securities losses, common share repurchases of $1.2 billion and common and
preferred stock dividends of $0.6 billion.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW

We have three reportable business segments:

•
•
•

Retail Banking
Corporate & Institutional Banking
Asset Management Group

Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of
this Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review
of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.

Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a
funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.

Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category as shown in Table 75 in
Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the
criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities, including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities,
certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are
not allocated to business segments, exited businesses and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP).

Retail Banking

Retail Banking's core strategy is to help all of our consumer and small business customers move forward financially. We aim to grow our primary checking and transaction
relationships through strong customer acquisition and retention. We seek to deepen relationships by meeting the broad range of our customers’ financial needs with savings,
liquidity, lending, investment and retirement solutions. A strategic priority for us is to differentiate the customer experience, leveraging technology to make banking easier for
our customers. A key element of our strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels, with an emphasis on digital capabilities, while continuing to
optimize the traditional branch network. In addition, we are focused on consistently engaging both our employees and customers, which is a strong driver of customer growth,
retention and relationship expansion.

Retail Banking earnings for the first quarter of 2022 decreased $267 million compared with the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased noninterest expense and a lower
provision recapture, partially offset by higher revenue.

Net interest income increased primarily due to growth in average deposit and loan balances, reflecting the BBVA acquisition, along with wider interest rate spreads on the value
of loans, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.

Noninterest income increased due to higher card and cash management revenue, driven by debit card, credit card, and merchant services, higher asset management and
brokerage fees and lending and deposit services which benefited from the addition of BBVA customers and increased business activity.

Provision recapture in the first three months of 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of improved COVID-19 related economic conditions and changes in portfolio
composition.

Noninterest expense increased primarily as a result of the impact of BBVA operating expenses, increased operational losses, personnel, technology and customer related
transaction costs.

The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific
deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the first three months of 2022, average total deposits increased compared to the
same period in 2021 primarily driven by growth in demand and savings deposits which benefited from the impact of the BBVA acquisition and elevated balances from
government stimulus payments.

Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first three months of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021. Average consumer loans increased 28% due to the impact
of the BBVA acquisition on all loan classes except education loans, which BBVA did not have in their loan portfolio. In addition, average residential real estate loans increased
due to continued strength in portfolio originations. Average commercial loans decreased primarily due to forgiveness of PPP loans.

As a result of the BBVA acquisition, we have become a coast-to-coast retail bank and added over 600 branches across seven states to our network. We continue to execute our
national expansion strategy, which is designed to grow customers with digitally-led banking and a thin branch network utilizing solution centers as we expand into new markets.
Solution centers are an emerging branch operating model with a distinctive layout, where routine transactions are supported through a combination of technology and skilled
banker assistance to create personalized experiences. The primary focus of the solution center is to bring a community element to our digital banking capabilities and provide a
collaborative environment that connects our customers with our solutions and services, beyond deposits and withdrawals. In total, we have opened 33 solution centers within
the markets of Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Nashville and Phoenix. In our expansion markets we offer several digital products
including Virtual Wallet and savings and deposit products, and unsecured installment and small business loans.

® 

Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are
focused on meeting the financial needs of customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products. In 2021, we successfully rolled out Low Cash
Mode  to all Virtual Wallet  customers providing them with the ability to avoid unnecessary overdraft fees through real-time intelligent alerts, extra time to prevent or address
overdrafts, and controls to choose whether to return certain debits rather than the bank making the decision.

®

®

Retail Banking continued to execute on its strategy of transforming the customer experience through transaction channel migration, branch network and home lending process
transformations and multi-channel engagement and service strategies. We are also continually assessing our current branch network for optimization opportunities as usage of
alternative channels has increased and as a result, have closed 39 branches in the first three months of 2022, consistent with our plan.

(d) Represents net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing, net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to amortization expense and payoffs. Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation,

(e) As of March 31.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first three months of 2022 decreased $102 million compared with the same period in 2021 driven by a lower provision
recapture and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income.

Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to higher average loan and deposit balances reflecting the BBVA
acquisition and organic growth, as well as wider interest rate spreads on the value of loans, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.

Noninterest income in the comparison was largely stable as lower capital markets related fees and commercial mortgage banking activities were mostly offset by higher treasury
management product revenue.

Provision recapture in the first three months of 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of improved COVID-19 related economic conditions.

Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely due to the BBVA acquisition and higher personnel costs associated with increased business activity.

Average loans increased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2021 due to increases in Corporate Banking, Business Credit and Real Estate, partially offset by
decreases in Commercial Banking:

•

•

•

•

Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and
government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business increased reflecting loans from BBVA, higher average utilization of loan commitments and new
production.
Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans
are mainly secured by business assets. Average loans for this business increased primarily driven by loans from BBVA, higher utilization of loan commitments and new
production.
Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business increased reflecting
loans from BBVA, partially offset by lower commercial mortgage and multifamily agency warehouse lending.
Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for
this business declined primarily driven by PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by loans from BBVA.

The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time,
executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits increased in the
comparison reflecting deposits from BBVA. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments to evolving market conditions, bank funding
needs and client relationship dynamics.

In 2021, the BBVA acquisition accelerated Corporate & Institutional Banking’s geographic expansion. Following the BBVA acquisition and our de novo expansion efforts, we
are now a coast-to-coast franchise and operate in the largest 30 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. These expanded locations complement Corporate & Institutional Banking’s
national businesses with a significant presence in these cities and our full suite of commercial products and services is now offered nationally.

Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets
related products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services
is included in net interest income and noninterest income. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the
Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 12 includes the
consolidated revenue to PNC for treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.

The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and disbursement management services, funds transfer
services, international payment services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting services. Within Treasury Management, PNC Global Transfers
provides wholesale money transfer processing capabilities between the U.S. and Mexico and other countries primarily in Central and South America. Treasury management
revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to
customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services.

18    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

Net interest income primarily includes revenue from all treasury management customer deposit balances. Compared with the first three months of 2021, treasury management
revenue increased due to higher noninterest income and higher deposit balances, including the impact of the acquisition of BBVA, partially offset by narrower interest rate
spreads on the value of deposits.

Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and noninterest income), revenue derived from
commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison
primarily due to lower commercial mortgage servicing income and lower revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale.

Capital markets related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory
and equity capital markets advisory related services. The Consolidated Income Statement includes the noninterest income to PNC for capital markets related products and
services. Compared with the first three months of 2021, capital markets related noninterest income decreased due to lower credit valuation on customer-related derivatives
activities, lower advisory revenue and lower underwriting fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher loan syndication fees.

The Asset Management Group consists of two primary businesses: PNC Private Bank and Institutional Asset Management.

The PNC Private Bank is focused on being a premier private bank in each of the markets it serves. The business seeks to deliver high quality banking, trust, and investment
management services to our emerging affluent, high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients through a broad array of products and services.

20    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

  
  
 
Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, private real estate, cash and fixed income client solutions, and retirement plan fiduciary
investment services to institutional clients including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies, unions, municipalities and non-profits.

With the inclusion of BBVA, PNC Private Bank has approximately 100 offices operating in nine out of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with
retail banking branches.

Asset Management Group earnings in the first three months of 2022 increased $3 million compared with the same period in 2021 primarily due to the benefit of BBVA.

Net interest income increased due to growth in average loan and deposit balances, reflecting the BBVA acquisition and organic growth. This was partially offset by narrower
interest rate spreads on deposits.

The increase in noninterest income was primarily attributable to increases in the average equity markets and the benefit of BBVA.

Noninterest expense increased due to the impact of BBVA operations and higher personnel expense.

Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year primarily due to the benefit of BBVA and higher equity markets as of March 31, 2022.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2021 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework including risk culture, enterprise strategy, risk
governance and oversight framework, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting. Additionally, our 2021 Form 10-K
provides an analysis of the firm's Capital Management and our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to Credit, Market, Liquidity and Operational (including
Compliance and Information Security).

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk, including our credit risk management processes, is described in further detail in the Credit Risk Management section of our 2021 Form 10-K. The following
provides additional information around our loan portfolio, which is our most significant concentration of credit risk.

Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis

Table 14: Details of Loans
In billions

We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 1 of this Report, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the
significant loan classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 21  

Commercial

Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 54% and 53% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The majority of our commercial
and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples
of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other
business assets.

We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level.
To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional
credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition
to monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies that may exist in our portfolio. Our
commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified as shown in the following table which provides a breakout by industry classification (classified based on the North
American Industry Classification System).

Commercial and industrial loan growth from December 31, 2021 was driven by increased utilization of loan commitments and new loan production, partially offset by PPP loan
forgiveness. PPP loans outstanding totaled $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $19.3 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $7.0 billion of real estate construction project loans and
$7.9 billion of intermediate term financing loans as of March 31, 2022. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2021 were $18.6 billion, $7.3 billion and $8.1 billion,
respectively.

We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated
with these types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also
monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

As remote work continues to be a feasible alternative and notable portions of leased space remain unoccupied, real estate related to the office sector is an area of growing
uncertainty. Evolving conditions suggest a structural change for office demand moving forward; however, the change is anticipated to evolve over time. PNC continues to
closely monitor our exposure in the office sector as these concerns develop, and while internal risk assessments have moved moderately higher, we have not seen a notable
change in performance at this time.

Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least quarterly. We track borrower performance
monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., nonconforming, conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk
management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to
agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do
not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $36.2 billion at March 31, 2022
with 43% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2021 were $34.9 billion and 42%, respectively.

Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $16.6 billion of primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $7.6 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans at March 31,
2022. Comparable amounts were $15.8 billion and $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, respectively.

We track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly similarly to residential real estate loans. We also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home
equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans
regardless of whether we hold the lien. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment
the portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.

The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien
position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management
purposes. We use a third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

Automobile
Auto loans comprised $14.8 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and $1.2 billion in the direct auto portfolio as of March 31, 2022. Comparable amounts as of December 31,
2021 were $15.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of loans originated through franchised dealers, including from expansion into new
markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores noted in Table 19. We offer both new and
used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At March 31, 2022, the portfolio balance was composed of 52% new vehicle loans and 48% used vehicle loans.
Comparable amounts at December 31, 2021 were 53% and 47%, respectively.

The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least
quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience.
As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and
term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and
include nonperforming TDRs and PCD loans, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under
the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2021

As of March 31, 2022, approximately 98% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses.

Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprised 42% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans while home equity TDRs comprised 34%
of home equity nonperforming loans at March 31, 2022. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2021 were 42% and 36%, respectively. TDRs generally remain in
nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs.
Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to
borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. See Troubled Debt Restructurings
and Loan Modifications within this Credit Risk Management section for more information on how certain loans to borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related difficulties were
treated prior to the expiration of CARES Act TDR relief.

Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency status
is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government
insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given current events, economic conditions and
expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment and the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer
support, we have customer assistance, loan modification and collection programs that align with the CARES Act and subsequent interagency guidance. As a result, under the
CARES Act credit reporting rules, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021
based on the contractual terms of the loan, even where borrowers may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period.

Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The decline in accruing loans past due from December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by the resolution of BBVA conversion-related administrative and operational delays.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, (ii) managed in
homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are
excluded from nonperforming loans.

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications

Troubled Debt Restructurings
A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation
activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss
and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court-imposed concessions (e.g., a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is
discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan). Loans to borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships that met
certain criteria under the CARES Act were not categorized as TDRs during the relief period, which expired on January 1, 2022. Consistent with the expiration of the CARES
Act TDR relief (and as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act), loans that experience a COVID-19 related hardship and are restructured after January 1, 2022 are
subject to existing GAAP guidance related to TDRs.

(b) Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and certain loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.

Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 40% of total nonperforming loans and 60% of total TDRs at March 31, 2022. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2021
were 40% and 62%, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual status after performing under the restructured terms for at
least six consecutive months.

See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report for additional information on
TDRs.

Loan Modifications
PNC provides relief to our customers through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation and may
involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship relief programs,
including COVID-19 related hardships that extended beyond the initial relief period.

See Troubled Debt Restructurings within this Credit Risk Management section for more information on how certain loans to borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related
difficulties were treated prior to the expiration of CARES Act TDR relief.

For additional information related to loan modifications granted in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk
Management section of our 2021 Form 10-K.

Allowance for Credit Losses
Our ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, which is captured through current PD, as well as current borrower and transaction characteristics, including
borrower repayment status, consumer credit scores, collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other
relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, trade receivables and
other financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term of the
assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date.

See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K and the Credit Risk Management section within
Item 7 of our 2021 Form 10-K for additional discussion of our ACL, including details of our methodologies. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section
of this Financial Review for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of March 31, 2022.

Liquidity and Capital Management

Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2021 Form 10-K.

One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations
maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as
of March 31, 2022, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the minimum requirement of 100%.

The NSFR, which became effective on July 1, 2021, is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-
year time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank are required to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis, and as of March 31, 2022, the NSFR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the
minimum requirement of 100%.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and
Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K.

30    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost
funding. Total deposits decreased to $450.2 billion at March 31, 2022 from $457.3 billion at December 31, 2021, driven by decreases in both noninterest-bearing and interest-
bearing deposits. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for additional information related to our deposits.
Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity position.

At March 31, 2022, our liquid assets consisted of cash and due from banks and short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-
earning deposits with banks) totaling $59.9 billion and securities available for sale totaling $112.3 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors,
including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Our liquid assets included $18.3 billion of securities available for sale and
trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $7.9 billion of securities held to maturity
were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.

We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term borrowings
(securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review
in this Financial Review and Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information
related to our borrowings.

Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, decreased due to the following activity:

Bank Liquidity
Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of
its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes)
from their date of issue. At March 31, 2022, PNC Bank had $11.0 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $6.0 billion were senior bank notes and $5.0 billion
were subordinated bank notes.

The following table details PNC Bank note redemptions in the first quarter of 2022:

2022.
All outstanding senior bank notes with an original scheduled maturity date of February 24, 2023. The securities had a distribution rate
of 1.743%. The redemption price was equal to $1,000 per $1,000 in principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to the
redemption date of February 24, 2022.

See Note 16 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for details on the $750 million bank note redemption announced on April 29,
2022.

PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not
viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At
March 31, 2022, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $96.2 billion.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 31  

PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At March 31, 2022, there were no issuances outstanding under this
program.

Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank, or through issuing its senior unsecured notes.

Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt
service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as
paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.

At March 31, 2022, available parent company liquidity totaled $7.4 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash and investments. For investments with longer
durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.

The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:

•
•
•
•
•

Bank-level capital needs,
Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
Corporate policies,
Contractual restrictions, and
Other factors.

There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or
its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was $1.9 billion at March 31,
2022. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.

In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other
subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the
issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Authorized by the Board of Directors, the parent
company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At March 31, 2022, there were no commercial paper issuances
outstanding.

The following table details Parent Company note redemptions in the first quarter of 2022:

Table 28: Parent Company Notes Redeemed

Redemption Date
February 7, 2022

Amount
$1.0 billion

Description of Redemption
$1.0 billion of senior notes with a maturity date of March 8, 2022. The securities had a distribution rate of 3.30%. The redemption price
was equal to $1,000 per $1,000 in principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption date of February 7,
2022. 

Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $9.9 billion and $11.4 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of our 2021 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in
the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our
commitments in Note 8 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain
products.

32    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of
earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access
to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 of our 2021 Form 10-K.

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital
instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.

See Note 16 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for details regarding the Series U preferred stock issuance.

In the first quarter of 2022, we returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through $1.2 billion of common share repurchases, representing 6.4 million shares, and $0.5
billion of dividends on common shares. The SCB framework allows for capital returns in amounts up to the level of capital in excess of the SCB minimum. Consistent with the
flexibility provided under the SCB framework, our Board of Directors has recently authorized a new share repurchase structure, under the already approved authorization for
repurchases of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 64% were still available at March 31, 2022. This structure allows for the continuation of our recent
quarterly average share repurchase levels as well as the flexibility to increase those levels should conditions warrant.

On April 1, 2022, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.50 per share, an increase of 25 cents per share, or 20%, effective with
the May 5, 2022 dividend payment.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard

is being phased-in to regulatory capital over the next three years.
The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and excludes the benefits of the optional five-year transition.

(b)
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance

sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.

(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g)

Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.

PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining
credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, TDRs, past due
exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.

The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting banks to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated
impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date,
excluding the initial allowance for PCD loans from BBVA, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital over the next three years. See additional discussion of this rule in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2021 Form 10-K.

At March 31, 2022, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”,
PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at
least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.

Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum
and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient

34    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these
regulatory principles, and believe that our March 31, 2022 capital levels were aligned with them.

We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1
Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K.

Market Risk Management

See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management Section in our 2021 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding market risk.

Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions,
movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of
our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not
only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.

Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and
Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the first quarters of 2022 and 2021 follow:

Table 31: Interest Sensitivity Analysis

In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest
rate environments. Table 32 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods, assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate
forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates
superimposed on current base rates) scenario.

All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.

When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the
behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the
other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 31 and 32. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market
rates.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q 35  

The following graph presents the SOFR curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.

Table 33: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward

The first quarter 2022 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping
interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates
and market conditions.

LIBOR Transition
The scheduled discontinuance of the requirement that banks submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after June 30, 2023 presents risks to the financial instruments originated,
held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate. For more discussion regarding the transition from LIBOR, see the Risk Management section in Item 7 of our 2021
Form 10-K.

Key efforts related to our transition plan to date have included:

Enhancing fallback language in new contracts and reviewing existing legal contracts/agreements to assess fallback language impacts,

•
• Making preparations for internal operational readiness,
• Making necessary enhancements to PNC's infrastructure, including systems, models, valuation tools and processes,
•
•
• Monitoring developments associated with LIBOR alternatives and industry practices related to LIBOR-indexed instruments,
•
•

Developing and delivering on internal and external LIBOR cessation communication plans,
Engaging with PNC clients, industry working groups and regulators,

Incorporating BBVA into PNC’s LIBOR transition effort, and
Initiating the offering of instruments referencing alternative rates in order to align with regulatory guidance encouraging the transition away from the use of USD LIBOR
in new contracts after December 31, 2021.

PNC also was an active participant in efforts with the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to explore the potential need for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to SOFR
for use in commercial loans. Those efforts led to the formation of the Credit Sensitivity Group, which held a series of workshops to assess how a credit-sensitive rate or add-on
to SOFR might be constructed and discuss associated implementation issues.

PNC began offering conforming adjustable rate mortgages using SOFR instead of USD LIBOR, in line with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements, and nonconforming
adjustable rate residential mortgages using SOFR and private student loans using Prime. Alternative rates including, but not limited to, the Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield
Index and SOFR are currently being offered to our corporate and commercial customers. The focus for 2022 is planning for the cessation event in 2023 for all lines of business.
Corporate & Institutional Banking has initiated amending contracts with inadequate fallback language, working on systems enhancements and continuing with client outreach
and education. PNC has provided regular updates to Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC examination staff regarding its LIBOR cessation and transition plans.

Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related
hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities.We do
not engage in proprietary trading of these products.

We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on
the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the

36    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –  Form 10-Q

portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions
and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its acceptable limits.

See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2021 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our
backtesting process.

Customer-related trading revenue was $88 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to $111 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The
decrease was primarily due to the impact of the changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities and lower customer related trading results. This was
partially offset by increased interest rate derivative and foreign exchange client sales revenues.

Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits,
underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations
and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with
regulatory limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.

Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy
limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included
unfunded commitments totaling $2.2 billion at both March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K has further information on
tax credit investments.

Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity
investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion at March 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, $1.8 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.1 billion was invested indirectly through
various private equity funds.

Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under
limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending
interchange litigation. Based upon the March 31, 2022 per share closing price of $221.77 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the
Class B common shares was approximately $1.3 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was insignificant. See Note 15 Fair
Value and Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2021 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa
agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the shares' limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the
marketplace.

We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment
strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and $38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit
risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.

Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment
and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements
and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.

Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 1 of this Report.

Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to
unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

In March 2022, President Biden issued an executive order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. The order addresses the development of a central bank
digital currency in the United States, which has the potential to fundamentally change the business of banking and financial services by, among other things, significantly
reducing deposits held at banks. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to lead work with a number of relevant agencies on a report due in September 2022 on the future
of money and payment systems that will include consideration of the implications, benefits, and risks of a U.S. central bank digital currency, and the actions required to launch
a central bank digital currency if doing so is deemed to be in the national interest.

In March 2022, the SEC released a proposed rule that would require public companies, like PNC, to include comprehensive climate-related information in their registration
statements and periodic reports, including quantitative and qualitative data, such as the company’s greenhouse gas emissions, certain climate-related financial statement metrics
and related disclosures to be included in a note to a registrant’s audited financial statements, whether climate-related risks are reasonably likely to have a material impact over
the short, medium, and long term, and the company’s climate-specific governance and risk management processes. The greenhouse gas emissions that would have to be
disclosed include the company’s direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (Scope 1), indirect emissions from the company’s consumption of energy purchased from
third parties (Scope 2), and, if material or part of a public emission target or goal, indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in the company’s value chain
(Scope 3). For large companies like PNC, the Scope 1 and 2 emission disclosures would require attestation from a third party. If adopted in 2022, these new requirements would
begin to apply to reports filed in 2024, including the 2023 Form 10-K (though disclosure of Scope 3 emissions would be delayed for an additional year).

In March 2022, the SEC released a proposed rule that would impose new disclosure requirements on public companies, like PNC, regarding cybersecurity risk management,
strategy, governance, and incident reporting. The SEC’s proposal would require public companies to report material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K within four days of
determining that a material incident occurred and would require updates about previously reported material cybersecurity incidents through the company’s Forms 10-K and 10-
Q. The proposal would also require periodic disclosure of a company’s policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks, management’s role and expertise in
implementing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies, and the board’s oversight role and cybersecurity expertise. Comments on the proposal are due by May 9, 2022.
The SEC’s proposal follows the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC November 2021 computer-security incident notification rule, which requires banking organizations to notify
their primary federal regulator of certain computer-security incidents within 36 hours, and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, which directs the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to promulgate rules to require certain critical infrastructure entities, including banks like PNC Bank, to report certain cyber
incidents within 72 hours and ransomware payments in response to a ransomware attack within 24 hours.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2021 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of
these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and commercial MSRs and level 3 fair value
measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2021 Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments
around the ACL.

Allowance for Credit Losses

We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans,
equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into
consideration expected prepayments. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and transaction
characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We use
methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of
our data and models and other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our best estimate of amounts that we do
not expect to collect because of, among other things, idiosyncratic risk factors, changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in forecasted results, or other potential
methodology limitations. The major drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:

•

•

•

•

Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As          current economic conditions evolve,
forecasted losses could be materially affected.         
Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic forecasts and thus vary significantly between
upside and downside scenarios. Changes to probability weights assigned to these scenarios and timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially
affect our loss estimates.
Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics, including credit metrics and collateral
type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
Portfolio volume and mix: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition.

For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following
components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies in our 2021 Form 10-K.

Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Under CECL, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose,
we have established a framework which includes a three year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination
create a forecast of expected economic outcomes over our reasonable and supportable forecast period. Credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period
are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.

To generate the four economic forecast scenarios we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert
judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight)
in order to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle
evolution and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to
estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans and securities. Each quarter the scenarios are presented for approval to PNC’s RAC, and the committee determines and
approves CECL scenarios' weights for use for the current reporting period.

The scenarios used for the period ended March 31, 2022 reflect a moderate increase in downside risk compared to December 31, 2021. The current outlook considers the
inflationary pressures that have broadened and intensified in recent months, along with the projected impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on short-term growth and
inflation in the U.S economy. Our economic outlook also accounts for our expectation that the FOMC will raise interest rates more aggressively than what was expected at
December 31, 2021, in line with a worsening inflation outlook and FOMC guidance. Despite the increasing downside risks, expectations for growth in 2022 remain solid driven
by consumer wealth and liquidity.

We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with the most significant drivers being Real GDP and the U.S. unemployment rate. The following table presents a
comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Real GDP growth is expected to end 2022 at 2.2% on a weighted average basis, down from the 2.8% assumed at December 31, 2021 due primarily to slower short-term growth
in the early part of 2022. Growth then slows to 1.4% and 1.3% in 2023 and 2024 consistent with the weighted average expectations at year-end. The improvement in the labor
market has outpaced expectations from the end of 2021. As such, the weighted-average projection of the unemployment rate is expected to end 2022 at 4.3% and 2023 at 4.1%.
This is a slight improvement from the weighted-average projections as of December 31, 2021, which had the unemployment rate reaching 4.4% in 2022.

The economy has seen significant recovery from the onset of the pandemic. National macroeconomic indicators, forecasts and performance expectations have all steadily
improved, helping to lower overall loss expectations. These improvements continued to be reflected in the reserve releases in the first quarter of 2022, including in certain
segments initially impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions. However, for certain portions of our commercial and consumer portfolios, considerable uncertainty remains
regarding lifetime losses. For commercial borrowers, there are still lingering concerns around certain industries that have been affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and
emerging secular changes. For consumer borrowers, higher inflation risk and fading effects of government stimulus could reduce consumer liquidity and change payment
hierarchy. As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analysis around these segments to ensure our reserves are
adequate in the current economic environment. While we retain some portion of COVID-19 related risk, we believe that this continues to reduce with the passage of time. In
addition to COVID related concerns, elevated consumer liquidity and increased demand for goods has resulted in pressure on the global supply chain. While global economies
continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturing capacity and delivery times have experienced numerous disruptions. The supply chain reserve impacts
observed to-date have been limited to PNC’s commercial and industrial customers. Furthermore, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine began in late February, supply
chain pressures were further stressed as assets, employees, and outputs from both regions are effectively cut off from the global supply chain. The impact of these issues on
PNC's customers are quantitatively and qualitatively assessed, with increased risk likely to continue to materialize.

We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth and granular analysis we have addressed
reserve requirements for specific populations most affected in the current environment. Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected
credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date.

Description

Financial Statement Impact

• We are currently working on our plan to adopt the standard. We do not

expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact our consolidated
results of operations or our consolidated financial position. We are still
assessing the changes required to satisfy the new disclosure requirements.

• Required effective date of January 1, 2023; early adoption is permitted.
• Eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and requires an entity to
apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine
whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an
existing loan.

• Enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and

restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial
difficulty.

• Requires disclosure of current-period gross writeoffs by year of

origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases
within the scope of CECL.

• Requires a prospective transition approach to all amendments except
those related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs (which
allow a modified retrospective transition approach through a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of
adoption).

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of March 31, 2022, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and
of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.

Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of March 31, 2022, and that there has been no change in
PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently
expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:

–

–

–

–

The U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic-caused recession in the first half of 2020. Growth is likely to remain above the economy’s long-run
average throughout this year. Consumer spending growth will remain solid in 2022 due to good underlying fundamentals.
Supply-chain difficulties will gradually ease over the course of 2022. Labor shortages will remain a constraint this year, although strong wage growth will
support consumer spending
Inflation accelerated in the second half of 2021 to its fastest pace in decades due to strong demand but limited supplies coming out of the pandemic for some
goods and services. Higher energy prices are adding to inflationary pressures in the first half of 2022. Inflation will slow in the second half of 2022 as
pandemic-related supply and demand imbalances recede and energy prices stabilize. However, inflation will also broaden throughout the economy due to wage
growth. The annual inflation rate will end 2022 above the Federal Reserve’s long-run objective of 2%.
PNC expects the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate by 0.50% in May, 0.25% in June, 0.50% in July, 0.25% in September and 0.25% in December to reach a
range of 2.00% to 2.25% by the end of the year. The FOMC will then further increase the federal funds rate in 2023. Also, the Federal Reserve will start to
reduce its balance sheet in the next few months.

– Uncertainty about the outlook has increased with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has created additional risk to higher inflation this year, which could lead
the FOMC to tighten more aggressively than currently anticipated. In addition, risks to growth and the likelihood of a recession in late 2022 or 2023 have
increased.

•

•

PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an SCB established by the Federal
Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board's CCAR process.
PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations
then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital
ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and
regulatory review of related models.

Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position,
reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and
ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:

–

Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, bank capital and liquidity
standards, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.

– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in
monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses
and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.
Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.
Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our
intellectual property protection in general.

–
–

Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through
effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity
standards.

• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired

and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our
inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired
businesses into PNC after closing. Many of these risks and uncertainties are present in our acquisition and integration of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary,
BBVA USA.
Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and
revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security
breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2021 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management
sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be
subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
