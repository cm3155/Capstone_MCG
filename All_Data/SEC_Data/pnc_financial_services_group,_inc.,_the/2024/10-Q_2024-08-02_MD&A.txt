Signature Bank Portfolio Acquisition
On October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an
agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately
$16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition.
Workforce Reduction
During the fourth quarter of 2023, PNC implemented a workforce reduction that is expected to reduce 2024 personnel expense by
approximately $325 million, on a pre-tax basis. PNC incurred expenses of $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection
with this workforce reduction.

FDIC Special Assessment
In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance
Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. As a result,
PNC incurred a pre-tax expense of $515 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an
additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses.

Income Statement Highlights
Net income of $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024 increased $133 million, or 10%,
compared to $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher noninterest and net
interest income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses.
• For the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024:
• Total revenue increased $266 million, or 5%, to $5.4 billion.
• Net interest income of $3.3 billion increased $38 million, or 1%, reflecting higher yields on interest-earning
assets.
• Net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.60%.
• Noninterest income increased $228 million, or 12%, and included the impact of a $754 million gain
resulting from PNC’s participation in the Visa exchange program, as well as a securities loss of $497
million related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. The second quarter of 2024 also
included Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments, primarily related to the extension of anticipated
litigation resolution timing, of negative $116 million. The first quarter of 2024 included negative $7 million
of Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments.
• Provision for credit losses of $235 million in the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflected the impact of portfolio
activity. The first quarter of 2024 included a provision for credit losses of $155 million.
• Noninterest expense increased $23 million, or 1%, to $3.4 billion. The modest increase was driven by higher
marketing and equipment expenses, partially offset by seasonally lower incentive compensation. Other noninterest
expense included a $120 million pre-tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 related to a PNC Foundation
contribution. The first quarter of 2024 included a $130 million pre-tax expense related to the increase in the FDIC’s
expected losses.
Net income of $2.8 billion, or $6.48 per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2024 decreased $373 million, or 12%,
compared to $3.2 billion, or $7.34 per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2023 driven by lower net interest income,
partially offset by higher noninterest income.
• For the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023:
• Total revenue decreased $340 million, or 3%, to $10.6 billion.
• Net interest income decreased $529 million, or 7%, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was
more than offset by increased funding costs.
• Net interest margin decreased 23 basis points.
• Noninterest income increased $189 million, or 5%, reflecting an increase in all categories. The first six
months of 2024 included the impact of a $754 million gain resulting from PNC’s participation in the Visa
exchange program, as well as a securities loss of $497 million related to the repositioning of the investment
securities portfolio.
• Provision for credit losses of $390 million in the first six months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity
and improved macroeconomic factors. The first six months of 2023 included a provision for credit losses of $381
million.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3 
• Noninterest expense was stable compared to the first six months of 2023, and reflected PNC’s continued focus on
expense management. Other noninterest expense included a $120 million pre-tax expense in the second quarter of
2024 related to a PNC Foundation contribution, as well as a $130 million pre-tax expense in the first quarter of 2024
related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.
Balance Sheet Highlights
Our balance sheet was well positioned at June 30, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:
• Total assets of $556.5 billion decreased primarily due to lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset
by higher securities balances.
• Total loans were stable at $321.4 billion.
• Total commercial loans increased $1.3 billion to $220.8 billion, primarily due to new production.
• Total consumer loans declined $1.4 billion to $100.6 billion, as paydowns outpaced originations and the utilization
of loan commitments.
• Investment securities increased $6.1 billion, or 5%, to $138.6 billion, due to increased net purchase activity, primarily of U.S.
Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. During the second quarter of 2024, PNC took
actions to reposition the investment securities portfolio. For additional details, see Investment Securities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.
• Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $10.8 billion, or 25%, to $33.0
billion, primarily due to higher securities balances and lower deposits.
• Total deposits decreased $5.0 billion, to $416.4 billion, reflecting lower consumer and commercial deposits. Noninterestbearing deposit balances decreased primarily driven by a decline in commercial balances. Interest-bearing deposits increased
modestly reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances.
• Borrowed funds decreased to $71.4 billion, due to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent company senior debt
issuances.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.
Credit Quality Highlights
The second quarter of 2024 reflected relatively stable credit quality performance.
• At June 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:
• Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $112 million, or 8%, driven by lower consumer and commercial
loan delinquencies.
• The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related
commitments, totaled $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The
decrease in the comparison was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. ACL to
total loans was 1.67% and 1.70% at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
• Nonperforming assets increased $321 million, or 14%, to $2.5 billion, primarily due to higher commercial real estate
nonperforming loans.
• Net loan charge-offs of $262 million, or 0.33% of average loans, in the second quarter of 2024 increased $19 million
compared to the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher commercial real estate net loan charge-offs.
For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
Capital and Liquidity Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
• Common shareholders’ equity of $46.4 billion at June 30, 2024 increased $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2023, due
to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by common dividends paid and common shares
repurchased.
• In the second quarter of 2024, PNC returned $0.7 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting $0.6 billion of dividends on
common shares and $0.1 billion of common share repurchases, representing 0.7 million shares.
• Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum
levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase
program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43% were still available for repurchase at
June 30, 2024. In light of the Federal banking agencies’ proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework,
third quarter 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average share repurchase
levels. PNC continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may adjust share repurchase activity
4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. Based on the results of the Federal
Reserve’s 2024 annual stress test, PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 will remain at
the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
• On July 2, 2024, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.60 per share, an
increase of 5 cents per share. The dividend is payable on August 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business
July 15, 2024.
• Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.2% at June 30, 2024 from 9.9% at December 31, 2023.
• PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full
impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first
quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being
phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of
CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 10.1%
at June 30, 2024 compared to 9.8% at December 31, 2023.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our
liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios.
PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an
SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional
information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review, the Recent Regulatory Developments
section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies.
These statements are based on our views that:
• Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth this year, but PNC’s baseline forecast is for slower
economic growth in 2024 as higher interest rates remain a drag on the economy.
• Real GDP growth this year will trend close to 2%, and the unemployment rate will increase modestly to above 4% by the end
of 2024. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, gradually moving back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% longterm objective.
• With slowing inflation PNC expects two federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the FOMC’s September and
December meetings, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.75% and 5.00%. PNC expects multiple federal funds
rate cuts in 2025 as inflation continues to ease.
Consistent with the forward guidance we provided on July 16, 2024, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of
2024, we expect:
• Average loans to be stable,
• Net interest income to be up 1% to 2%,
• Fee income to be up 1% to 2%,
• Other noninterest income, to be $150 million to $200 million,
• Noninterest expense to be down 1% to stable,
• Core noninterest expense to be up 3% to 4%, and
• Net loan charge-offs to be $250 million to $300 million.
Consistent with the forward guidance we provided on July 16, 2024, for the full year 2024, compared to the full year of 2023, we
expect:
• Average loans to be down less than 1%,
• Net interest income to be down approximately 4%,
• Noninterest income, to be up 5% to 7%,
• Noninterest income, excluding significant items, to be up 3% to 5%,
• Revenue to be stable to down 1%,
• Revenue, excluding significant items, to be down 1% to 2%,
• Noninterest expense to be down approximately 4%,
• Core noninterest expense to be down approximately 1%, and
• The effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5 
Significant items in the second quarter of 2024 are composed of a $754 million gain resulting from PNC’s participation in the Visa
exchange program, a $497 million securities loss related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio and a negative $116
million Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustment. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Reconciliation of Noninterest
income guidance, excluding significant items (non-GAAP) and Reconciliation of Revenue guidance, excluding significant items (nonGAAP) section of this Report. Other noninterest income, noninterest income and revenue guidance does not forecast net securities
gains or losses and other Visa activity.
Core noninterest expense excludes the pre-tax impacts of the $120 million expense in the second quarter of 2024 related to a
contribution to the PNC Foundation, $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses in the first quarter of 2024,
and, for the fourth quarter of 2023, $515 million pertaining to the FDIC special assessment and $150 million of workforce reduction
charges. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Reconciliation of Core Noninterest Expense (non-GAAP) section of this Report.
We are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, without unreasonable
effort, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, except for full year Noninterest income and Revenue guidance,
adjusted for $141 million in significant items incurred in the second quarter of 2024, and full year Core noninterest expense guidance
adjusted for $250 million in non-core expenses incurred in the first half of 2024. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting
the timing and amounts necessary for the reconciliation, when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted,
as noted in our Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors
included in our 2023 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report.
Net income of $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024 increased $133 million, or 10%,
compared to $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher noninterest and net
interest income, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses. Net income of $2.8 billion, or $6.48 per diluted common share,
for the first six months of 2024 decreased $373 million, or 12%, compared to $3.2 billion, or $7.34 per diluted common share, for the
same period in 2023 driven by lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in
Item 1 of this Report.
Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and
related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical
Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional
information.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7 
Net interest income increased $38 million, or 1%, and net interest margin increased 3 basis points compared to the first quarter of
2024, reflecting higher yields on interest-earning assets. In the year-to-date comparison, net interest income decreased $529 million, or
7%, and net interest margin decreased 23 basis points, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was more than offset by
increased funding costs.
Average investment securities increased $5.9 billion, or 4%, compared to the first quarter of 2024 reflecting net purchase activity,
primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. Average investment securities decreased
$3.8 billion, or 3%, in the year-to-date comparison as net purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.
Average investment securities represented 28% of average interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 26% for
the first quarter of 2024, and 27% for the first six months of 2024 compared to 28% for the first six months of 2023.
Average loans were stable for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2024, and included a modest decline in
consumer balances reflecting lower residential real estate and home equity loans. Compared to the first six months of 2023, average
loans decreased $4.8 billion, or 1%, primarily due to lower average utilization of commercial loan commitments. Average loans
represented 63% of average interest-earning assets for both the second and first quarters of 2024, and 63% for the first six months of
2024 compared to 64% for the first six months of 2023.
Average interest-earning deposits with banks for the second quarter of 2024 decreased $7.1 billion, or 15%, compared to the first
quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting net securities purchases. In the year-to-date comparison, average interest-earning deposits with
banks increased $11.9 billion, or 36%, due to higher borrowed funds and lower loan and securities balances, partially offset by lower
deposits.
Average interest-bearing deposits for the second quarter of 2024 were relatively stable compared to the first quarter of 2024, and
included a modest decline in commercial balances reflecting seasonal declines in corporate deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits
increased $7.3 billion, or 2%, in the year-to-date comparison. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 81% of average
interest-bearing liabilities for both the second and first quarters of 2024, and 81% for the first six months of 2024 compared to 83%,
for the first six months of 2023.
Average borrowed funds increased $1.9 billion, or 2%, and $12.2 billion, or 19%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons,
respectively. In both comparisons, the increase reflected parent company senior debt issuances.
Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 39% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 37% for the first quarter of
2024, and 38% for the first six months of 2024 compared to 35% for the same period in 2023.
Asset management and brokerage fees were stable compared to the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the year-to-date comparison
reflected the impact of higher annuity sales as well as higher average equity markets. PNC’s discretionary client assets under
management of $196 billion at June 30, 2024 increased from $195 billion and $176 billion at March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023,
respectively. In both comparisons, the increase was driven by higher spot equity markets.
8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Capital markets and advisory fees increased compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory
activity and increased loan syndication revenue, partially offset by lower underwriting fees. The increase in the year-to-date
comparison was primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity and increased underwriting fees, partially offset by
lower trading revenue.
Card and cash management revenue increased compared to the first quarter of 2024, reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction
volumes and higher treasury management product revenue. The increase compared to the first six months of 2023 was primarily due to
higher treasury management product revenue.
Lending and deposit services were relatively stable in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons.
Residential and commercial mortgage decreased compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower residential mortgage
activity. Residential and commercial mortgage were relatively stable compared to the first six months of 2023.
Other noninterest income increased in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons. The second quarter of 2024 included the
impact of a $754 million gain resulting from PNC’s participation in the Visa exchange program, as well as a securities loss of $497
million related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. The second quarter of 2024 also included Visa Class B
derivative fair value adjustments, primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution timing, of negative $116
million. The first quarter of 2024 included negative $7 million of Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments.

Noninterest expense increased 1% compared to the first quarter of 2024. The modest increase was driven by higher marketing and
equipment expenses, partially offset by seasonally lower incentive compensation. Noninterest expense was stable compared to the first
six months of 2023 and reflected PNC’s continued focus on expense management. Other noninterest expense included a $120 million
pre-tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 related to a PNC Foundation contribution as well as a $130 million pre-tax expense in
the first quarter of 2024 related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses.

Our balance sheet was well positioned at June 30, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:
• Total assets decreased primarily due to lower balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset by higher
securities balances.
• Total liabilities decreased primarily due to lower deposits.
• Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by dividends paid and
common shares repurchased.
The ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in
the comparison was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. See the following for additional
information regarding our ACL related to loans:
• Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review,
• Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review, and
• Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.

For additional information regarding our loan portfolio see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in
this Financial Review and Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.
Investment Securities
Investment securities of $138.6 billion at June 30, 2024 increased $6.1 billion, or 5%, compared to December 31, 2023, due to
increased net purchase activity, primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.
In the second quarter of 2024, we repositioned the investment securities portfolio and sold available for sale securities with a market
value of $3.8 billion and a weighted average yield of approximately 1.5%. The sale of these securities resulted in a loss of
$497 million. We deployed the sale proceeds into available-for-sale securities with a market value of $3.8 billion and a weighted
average yield of approximately 5.5%.
The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to
optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 11 
Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at
June 30, 2024 primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of fixed-rate securities. We continually monitor
the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit
losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments.
See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding the allowance for investment securities.
The duration of investment securities was 3.6 years and 4.2 years at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We estimate
that at June 30, 2024 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in
interest rates and 3.6 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31,
2023 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.1 years and 4.2 years, respectively.
Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.5 years at
both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Deposits are considered an attractive source of funding due to their stability and relatively low cost to fund. Compared to December
31, 2023, both deposits and borrowed funds declined.
Total deposits decreased reflecting lower consumer and commercial deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased
primarily driven by a decline in commercial balances. Interest-bearing deposits increased modestly reflecting higher commercial
balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. This shift in deposit composition contributed to an increase in funding costs
compared to the first quarter of 2024. Our total brokered deposit balances of $10.5 billion at June 30, 2024 decreased compared to
$11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, and were significantly below both our internal and regulatory guidelines and limits.
Borrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances.
12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, capital
considerations, and funding needs, which are primarily driven by changes in loan, deposit and investment securities balances. While
our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses, we also
manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and
NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of
the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital activities. See
Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 9 Borrowed Funds in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to our
borrowings. See Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in the Statistical Information section of this Report for
additional information on volume and related funding cost changes.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $52.6 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting
net income of $2.8 billion and an improvement in AOCI of $0.3 billion, partially offset by dividends paid of $1.4 billion and $0.2
billion of common share repurchases.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW
We have three reportable business segments:
• Retail Banking
• Corporate & Institutional Banking
• Asset Management Group
Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in
Other, as shown in Table 79 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Other includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for
disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses,
ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments,
intercompany eliminations, corporate overhead net of allocations, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited
businesses and the residual impact from FTP operations.
Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the
presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
See Note 14 Segment Reporting for additional information on our business segments, including a description of each business.

Retail Banking earnings for the first six months of 2024 increased $1.2 billion compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to
higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, as well as a lower provision for credit losses.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
declines in average deposit balances.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison, reflecting a gain resulting from PNC’s participation in the Visa exchange program,
partially offset by lower card and cash management fees.
Provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic
factors.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, and included lower personnel expense.
Retail Banking average total loans remained relatively stable in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.
Average consumer loans decreased driven by lower residential real estate as a result of paydowns outpacing new volume, as well as
continued declines in education loans from runoff in the government guaranteed portfolio. Average commercial loans increased due to
growth in automobile dealer segment balances.
Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and
retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on
retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate-sensitive
customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first six months

the Federal Reserve and increased customer spending.
Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for
consumers and small businesses.
As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate and continue to optimize a coast-tocoast network of retail branches and ATMs, which are complemented by PNC’s suite of digital capabilities. In February 2024, PNC

Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first six months of 2024 increased $291 million compared to the same period in
2023 driven by higher revenue and a decline in noninterest expense, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average loan and deposit balances.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison and included higher capital markets and advisory fees and growth in treasury
management product revenue.
Provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic
factors.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, reflecting a continued focus on expense management.
Average loans decreased compared with the six months ended June 30, 2023:
• Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to
mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business decreased
driven by lower average utilization of loan commitments and paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by the
acquisition of capital commitment facilities from Signature Bridge Bank in the fourth quarter of 2023.
• Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average
loans for this business declined largely due to paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by a higher average
utilization of loan commitments.
• Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is mainly
secured by business assets. Average loans for this business declined, reflecting a lower average utilization of loan
commitments.
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller
corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined driven by paydowns outpacing new production and a
lower average utilization of loan commitments.
The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining
relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to
provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits were relatively stable compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023.
We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving
market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.
Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including
treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers
of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and
noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is
reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses
where the customer relationships exist. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for
treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services
follows.
The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and
disbursement management services, funds transfer services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting
services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes
treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for
products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management customer deposit balances.
Compared to the first six months of 2023, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of
deposits and higher product revenue.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 17 
Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and
noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total
revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to higher commercial mortgage loan
servicing income and a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of hedge, partially offset by lower
revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale.
Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital
markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The increase in
capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, underwriting
fees and loan syndication fees, partially offset by lower customer-related interest rate derivative trading revenue.

quality banking, trust and investment management services to our emerging affluent, high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients
through a broad array of products and services.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 19 
Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions, and
retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies,
municipalities and non-profits.
Asset Management Group earnings in the first six months of 2024 increased $85 million compared to the same period in 2023,
primarily driven by higher net interest income and a decline in noninterest expense.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and an increase in
average loan and deposit balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison primarily driven by higher average equity markets, partially offset by the impact of
client activity.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, reflecting a continued focus on expense management.
Average loans increased compared with the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by growth in residential mortgage loans.
Average deposits increased in the comparison reflecting growth in CD and deposit sweep balances, partially offset by declines in
savings and interest bearing deposits.
Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher equity markets as of
June 30, 2024.

We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and
measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan
classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.
Commercial
Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 56% and 55% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of
repayment should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as
accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business
assets.
We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of
the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity
in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to
monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies
that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following
table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).

(a) Represents loans to customers in the real estate and construction industries.
Owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $9.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and are included in commercial and industrial loans
as the credit decisioning for servicing these loans is based on the financial conditions of the owner; not the ability of the collateral to
generate income. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are well-diversified across industries. The comparable amount of
owner occupied commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2023 was $9.6 billion.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans of $35.5 billion as of June 30, 2024 comprised $20.2 billion related to commercial mortgages on incomeproducing properties, $9.2 billion of intermediate-term financing loans and $6.1 billion of real estate construction project loans. At
December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $35.4 billion, $21.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. Commercial real
estate primarily consists of an investment in land and/or buildings held to generate income, that income serves as the primary source
for the repayment of the loan. However, for all commercial real estate assets, the disposition of the assigned collateral serves as a
secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties.
We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD
and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location
and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The
portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

Commercial Real Estate: Office Portfolio
Given the foundational change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, real estate performance related to the office
sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. At June 30, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $7.5
billion, or 2.3% of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.3 billion. The portfolio is well diversified
geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. Within the office portfolio at June 30, 2024, criticized loans totaled 29.3% and
nonperforming loans totaled 11.0%, while delinquencies were 0.1%. As measured at origination, the weighted average LTV for the
office portfolio was 59%; however, updated appraisals have increased the weighted average LTV to 69% as of June 30, 2024. While
LTV is one consideration, our risk assessment considers a number of factors in assessing the changing conditions affecting the
portfolio. As of June 30, 2024, we have established reserves of 10.3% against office loans.
The greatest stress in our office portfolio is observed in multi-tenant office loans, which represents 55% of the portfolio at June 30,
2024. Within the multi-tenant classification, criticized levels were 51.9% while nonperforming loans totaled 19.7%, accounting for
almost all of the nonperforming office population. The weighted average LTV for multi-tenant is 76% at June 30, 2024. Additionally,
commercial real estate charge-offs since the beginning of 2023 have primarily been multi-tenant office loans. Given the higher level of
stress, this segment has a proportionally higher reserve rate of 15.5%. The remaining 45% of the office portfolio is primarily
comprised of single-tenant, medical and government tenant properties. This subset of the portfolio is performing considerably better,
with approximately 1% of the book in the criticized and nonperforming loan categories. As of June 30, 2024, the weighted average
LTV of this book is 60%.
Portfolio management efforts remain an elevated area of focus for the office portfolio, with internal risk ratings completed for each
asset quarterly, accelerated reappraisal requirements and elevated approval levels for any credit action. Refreshed appraisals have
updated valuations on nearly all of the criticized office exposure since the beginning of 2023. Additionally, active management efforts
include ongoing performance assessments as well as the review of property, lending and capital markets. Portfolio updates are
distributed to senior management weekly.
Given the ongoing change in this area, we expect additional stress in the office sector, and a portion of this stress will bear itself out as
we work through maturities that will approximate 41% through June 30, 2025. Upon maturity, and where the balance is not paid in
full, an extension may be granted because contractual extension terms are met; alternatively, an extension may be granted based on
22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
negotiated terms, and a portion of these extensions may involve the curtailment or charge off of principal. We continue to actively
manage the portfolio, and we believe reserve levels adequately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio.
Commercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio
As of June 30, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the multifamily portfolio totaled $16.5 billion, or 5.1% of total loans, while
additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $3.1 billion. Although inflationary pressures and higher interest rates have impacted
internal risk assessments and regulatory classification in this portfolio, we have not seen a notable change in loan performance at this
time with regards to nonperformance, delinquency or charge-offs. We continue to closely monitor our exposure in this sector.
Consumer
Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least
quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g.,
nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations.
The following table presents certain key statistics related to our residential real estate portfolio:

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network.
Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with
servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we
retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $42.3 billion at June 30,
2024, with 46% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $42.4 billion and 45%, respectively.
Home Equity
Home equity loans of $25.9 billion as of June 30, 2024 were comprised of $20.8 billion of home equity lines of credit and $5.1 billion
of closed-end home equity installment loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $26.2 billion, $20.6 billion and $5.6
billion, respectively. Home equity lines of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to
certain borrowers.
Similar to residential real estate loans, we track borrower performance of this portfolio on a monthly basis. We also segment the
population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 23 
or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of
whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis
and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy
status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.
The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of
the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at
the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to
obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

Automobile
Auto loans of $14.8 billion as of June 30, 2024 comprised $13.8 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and $1.0 billion in the direct auto
portfolio as of June 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $14.9 billion, $13.8 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including
dealers located in our newer markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.
The following table presents certain key statistics related to our indirect and direct auto portfolios:

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores
noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At June 30, 2024, the
portfolio balance was composed of 43% new vehicle loans and 57% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023
were 45% and 55%, respectively.
The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including both updated collateral values and FICO scores that are
obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type
and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the
portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.
Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans
accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent full collection of contractual principal and interest is
not probable. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option
are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for details on our nonaccrual
policies.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 25 
Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio.
Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due are
considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value
option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given
current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment, such as inflation
levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular
changes such as those arising from the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and
collection programs to assist our customers.
The following table presents a summary of accruing loans past due by delinquency status:

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the
process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines,
or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
Loan Modifications
We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease
modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship
relief programs. For additional information on our commercial real estate, office-related modification offerings, see the Commercial
Real Estate portion of the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
See Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on loan modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, the reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction
characteristics and assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date. We maintain the ACL at an
appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and
unfunded lending related commitments.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the Credit Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of our
ACL, including details of our methodologies. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for
further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of June 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Management
Our liquidity risk framework and related monitoring measures and tools, including internal liquidity stress testing as well as
compliance with internal and regulatory limits and guidelines, are described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management
section of our 2023 Form 10-K.
One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical
30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the second quarter of 2024. Fluctuations
in our average LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash
outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.
The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
NSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the second quarter of 2024.
28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These
deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits decreased to $416.4 billion at June 30, 2024 from $421.4
billion at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased primarily driven by a decline in commercial balances.
Interest-bearing deposits increased modestly reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. As of
June 30, 2024, uninsured deposits represented approximately 42% of our total deposit base, which is estimated based on the regulatory
instructions in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031. The majority of our uninsured deposits are related to
commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers who utilize two or more PNC
products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and Business Segments Review sections of this
Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
We may also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB
borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review and Note 7
Borrowed Funds in this Report for additional information related to our borrowings.
Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

In billions 2024
January 1 $ 31.7
Issuances 4.2
Calls and maturities (1.8)
Other (0.4)
June 30 $ 33.7
Additionally, certain liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity
position. PNC has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and
commitments, particularly in the event of liquidity stress. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity
under various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan’s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides
the strategies for addressing liquidity needs and responsive actions we would consider during liquidity stress events, which could
include the issuance of incremental debt, preferred stock, or additional deposit actions, including the issuance of brokered CDs. The
plan also addresses the governance, frequency of reporting and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of liquidity stress.
PNC defines our primary contingent liquidity sources as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities and unused
borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. The following table summarizes our primary contingent liquidity sources
at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

(a) Represents the fair value of investment securities that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.
(b) At June 30, 2024, total FHLB borrowing capacity was $72.7 billion and total FHLB borrowings and letters of credit were $35.1 billion. Comparable amounts at
December 31, 2023 were $73.4 billion and $38.0 billion, respectively.
(c) Total borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank was $85.3 billion at June 30, 2024 and $47.2 billion at December 31, 2023. PNC had no outstanding borrowings
with the Federal Reserve Bank at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
As part of PNC’s contingency planning, we pledged a portion of our available held to maturity investment securities at the Federal
Reserve Bank’s Discount Window during the first half of 2024, supporting our resilience and operational readiness.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29 
Bank Liquidity
In addition to our primary contingent liquidity sources, under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from
time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated
notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes)
from their date of issue. At June 30, 2024, PNC Bank’s remaining capacity to issue under the program was $33.3 billion.
Under PNC Bank’s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to
provide additional liquidity. At June 30, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or issuing
intercompany senior unsecured notes.
Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we manage the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the
parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases
and acquisitions.
At June 30, 2024, available parent company liquidity totaled $22.9 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash and
investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity
of parent company debt obligations.
The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may
be impacted by the following:
• Bank-level capital needs,
• Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
• Corporate policies,
• Contractual restrictions, and
• Other factors.
There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to
extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the
parent company without prior regulatory approval was $6.2 billion at June 30, 2024. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023
Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.
In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends
and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for
the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital
instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company’s 2014 commercial paper program, the
parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At June 30, 2024, there
were no issuances outstanding under this program.
The following table details parent company note issuances in the second quarter of 2024:
Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued
Issuance Date Amount Description of Issuance
May 14, 2024 $1.75 billion $1.75 billion of senior fixed-to-floating notes with a maturity date of May 14, 2030. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.492% per annum, on May 14 and November 14 of each year, beginning
on November 14, 2024. Beginning on May 14, 2029, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a floating rate
per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest period using the
SOFR Index as described in the Prospectus Supplement), plus 1.198%, on August 14, 2029, November 14,
2029, February 14, 2030 and at the maturity date.
Parent company senior and subordinated debt carrying value totaled $26.0 billion and $24.0 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively.
See Note 16 Subsequent Events for details on the parent company’s issuances of $1.0 billion of its 5.102% senior fixed-to-floating rate
notes that mature on July 23, 2027, and $1.5 billion of its 5.401% senior fixed-to-floating rate notes that mature on July 23, 2035.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and
postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section
of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we have
various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 8 Commitments.
Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative
instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset
quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the
cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on the potential impacts from a
downgrade to our credit ratings, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item
1 of our 2023 Form 10-K.
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming
debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and
managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
In the second quarter of 2024, PNC returned $0.7 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting $0.6 billion of dividends on common
shares and $0.1 billion of common share repurchases, representing 0.7 million shares. Consistent with the SCB framework, which
allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase
framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43%
were still available for repurchase at June 30, 2024. In light of the Federal banking agencies’ proposed rules to adjust the Basel III
capital framework, third quarter 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average share repurchase
levels. PNC continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may adjust share repurchase activity depending on
market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. Based on the results of the Federal Reserve’s 2024 annual stress test, PNC’s
SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 will remain at the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
On July 2, 2024 the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $1.60 per share, an increase of 5
cents per share. The dividend is payable on August 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business July 15, 2024.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year
transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.
(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both
on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under
the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.
Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject
to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory
capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in
retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for
PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional
discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.
At June 30, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and
10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 riskbased capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.
32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital
well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage
our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our June 30, 2024 capital levels were aligned with them.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts, including the
proposed rules to adjust the Basel III framework, in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors
and Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding
market risk.
Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors,
including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the
interest that we earn on assets, the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to
the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only
affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk
management policies, which are approved by management’s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
PNC utilizes sensitivities of NII and EVE to a set of interest rate scenarios to identify and measure its short-term and long-term
structural interest rate risks.
NII Sensitivity results for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow:
Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis
Second Quarter 2024 Second Quarter 2023
Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation
Effect on NII in first year from shocked interest rate:
200 basis point instantaneous increase (0.6) % 0.9 %
200 basis point instantaneous decrease (0.2) % (1.3) %
When forecasting net interest income, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including
the following:
Future Balance Sheet Composition: Our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations. As of the
second quarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot
composition as of the second quarter of 2024.
Deposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate, with the relationship between
deposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined as deposit beta. We define cumulative deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on
interest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate range since the first
quarter of 2022, the start of the current rising rate cycle. As of June 30, 2024, PNC’s cumulative deposit beta was 45%, an increase
from 39% at June 30, 2023. For interest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity
depending on market rate levels as well as other factors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience and future
expectations. Our scenario assumes that deposit betas increased slightly from current levels. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from
modeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer behavior.
Asset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios. Mortgage and home equity
portfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments. Commercial and
consumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios
historically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates.
Impact of Derivatives: PNC uses interest rate derivatives, some of which are forward starting, to hedge floating rate commercial loans.
PNC had $52.8 billion in receive fix/pay float swaps as of June 30, 2024, with a weighted average duration of 2.2 years and an
average fixed rate of 3.13%. As of June 30, 2024 PNC also had collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of
floors, that are used to hedge these commercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix/pay float swaps as a means of hedging
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33 
fixed rate debt, as well as pay fix/receive float swaps as a means of hedging the investment securities portfolio. See Note 12 Financial
Derivatives in this Report for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans, investment securities and
fixed rate debt.
EVE sensitivity results for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow:
Table 32: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Analysis
Second Quarter 2024 Second Quarter 2023
Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Simulation
200 basis point instantaneous increase (6.7) % (5.3) %
200 basis point instantaneous decrease 0.1 % (2.4) %
EVE measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include
projected new volume. EVE sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to NII sensitivity analysis and represents an
estimation of long-term interest rate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates. Similar to
the NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions. These methodologies are
largely consistent between the EVE and NII sensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit attrition is a significant contributor to EVE
sensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected based on a dynamic model developed using long-term historical deposit behavior in addition
to management assumptions including accelerated attrition for pandemic related excess deposits. PNC performs various sensitivity
analyses to understand the impact of faster and slower deposit attrition on our risk metrics, with the results reported to ALCO.
Compared to the second quarter of 2023, there have been no material changes to our NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,
including data sources that drive assumptions setting.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging
activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are
marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate
the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the
portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market
Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits. See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2023 Form 10-K for more
information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.
Customer-related trading revenue was $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $107 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower derivative client sales revenues, partially offset by higher
securities client sales revenues.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to
extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in
a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also
have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory
limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment
decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.
A summary of our equity investments follows:
Table 33: Equity Investments Summary

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax
credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2023 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit
investments.
Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid
portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity
investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $2.2 billion at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024,
$2.0 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity
funds.
During the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1
common shares into 1.8 million of Visa Class B-2 common shares and 0.7 million of Visa Class C common shares. The Visa Class
B-2 common shares remain subject to the same restrictions that were imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common shares. Participation in
the exchange required PNC to agree to a make-whole agreement that subjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations to Visa as prior
to participation in the exchange program.
In the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a $754 million gain related to the Visa Class C common shares received. Included in our
other equity investments at June 30, 2024, are Visa Class B-2 common shares, which are recorded at cost, and Visa Class C common
shares that are recorded at fair value. The fair value of our remaining Visa Class C common shares was approximately $0.2 billion at
June 30, 2024.
Visa Class B-2 common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until the resolution of the pending
interchange litigation or Visa launches another exchange program allowing PNC to convert a portion of its Visa Class B-2 common
shares into freely transferable Visa Class C common shares. The estimated value of our total investment in the Visa Class B-2
common shares was approximately $0.7 billion, while our cost basis was insignificant. The estimated value does not represent fair
value of the Visa Class B-2 common shares given the shares’ limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the
marketplace. See Note 14 Fair Value and Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our
Visa agreements.
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with
both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $19 million for both the six months
ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.
Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to
market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to
facilitate their risk management activities.
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a
notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount on these instruments.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15 Financial
Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be
ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Resolution and Recovery Planning
In June 2024, the FDIC revised its rule requiring certain insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to periodically submit a
resolution plan that, in the event of a hypothetical failure, should enable the FDIC to resolve the bank under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act. Under the final rule, most banks with $100 billion or more in assets, including PNC Bank, are required to submit full
resolution plans on a three-year cycle, with interim informational supplements due in off-years. The FDIC may also engage in
capabilities testing between full resolution plan submissions. The final rule significantly expands the required content elements and
adds virtual data room and valuation capabilities as significant components of the resolution planning process. The final rule indicates
that covered institutions will not be required to submit a resolution submission or interim informational supplement until at least 270
days from the effective date of October 1, 2024.
The OCC has proposed revisions to its recovery planning guidelines that apply to certain large insured national banks, including PNC
Bank. The proposal would incorporate an annual testing requirement into recovery plans, and would require covered banks to consider
both financial risks and non-financial risks – including operational and strategic risks – in their recovery plans. The proposal
contemplates that PNC Bank would have 12 months from the effective date of the amendments to comply with the changes.
Capital, Capital Planning and Liquidity
In June 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the results of its supervisory stress tests conducted as part of the 2024 CCAR process.
PNC remained well above its risk-based minimum capital requirements in the supervisory stress tests, and PNC’s SCB for the fourquarter period beginning October 1, 2024, will remain the regulatory minimum of 2.5%. See the Liquidity and Capital Management
portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for a discussion of PNC’s capital actions.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023
Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or
economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and
commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023
Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our
existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for
the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated
recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and
transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of
future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these
factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and
other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best
estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major
drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:
• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As
current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
• Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic
forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to the probability weights assigned to
these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
• Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics,
including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially
affected.
• Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of
one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.
36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Pursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses.
For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios
with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in
our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to
them.
To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic
forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forwardlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within
that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution
and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected
economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each
quarter, the scenarios and their respective weights are presented to RAC for approval.
The scenarios used for the period ended June 30, 2024 consider, among other factors, ongoing inflationary pressures and the
corresponding tightness of monetary policy and credit availability. Given these factors, growth is expected to slow from current levels
starting in the second half of 2024. While recession risks remain elevated, our most-likely expectation at June 30, 2024 is that the U.S.
economy avoids a recession in 2024.
We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.
unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average
scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Table 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios
Assumptions as of June 30, 2024
2024 2025 2026
U.S. real GDP (a) 1.1% 1.2% 2.2%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.3% 4.9% 4.4%
Assumptions as of December 31, 2023
2024 2025 2026
U.S. real GDP (a) 0.1% 1.5% 2.0%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.5% 4.6% 4.2%
(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.
(b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.
Real GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at 1.1% on a weighted average basis, up from the 0.1% assumed at December 31, 2023,
primarily due to stronger economic activity in 2024 than what was expected at the end of 2023. Growth then rises to 1.2% in 2025,
before jumping to 2.2% in 2026. The weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to end 2024 at 4.3%, down from the 4.5%
assumed at December 31, 2023. The weighted-average unemployment rate is then expected to increase through 2025, peaking at 4.9%
during the second half of the year, before gradually improving to 4.4% by the fourth quarter of 2026.
The current state of the economy continues to reflect uncertainty due to the foundational change in office demand from the acceptance
of remote work, combined with inflationary pressures, interest rate movements and declining consumer savings and deposit balances.
As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analyses around segments
impacted by such uncertainties to ensure our reserves are adequate, given our current macroeconomic expectations.
We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth
and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment.
Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance
sheet date.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of June 30, 2024, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
Based on that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were
effective as of June 30, 2024, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during

the second quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial
performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial
position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are
typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,”
“forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future
events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which
our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty
and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution
against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.
• Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:
– Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact
money supply, market interest rates and inflation,
– Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory
initiatives,
– Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,
– Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
– Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital
markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
– Our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
– Commodity price volatility.
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our views that:
– Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth this year, but PNC’s baseline forecast is
for slower economic growth in 2024 as higher interest rates remain a drag on the economy.
– Real GDP growth this year will trend close to 2%, and the unemployment rate will increase modestly to above 4%
by the end of 2024. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, gradually moving back to the Federal
Reserve’s 2% long-term objective.
– With slowing inflation PNC expects two federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the FOMC’s September
and December meetings, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.75% and 5.00%. PNC expects multiple
federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as inflation continues to ease.
• PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or
exceeding minimum capital levels, including a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection

• PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, PNC’s financial performance, the scope and
terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In
addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital
distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and
regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results
of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could
affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These
developments could include:
– Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in
the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations and changes in accounting and reporting standards.
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or
other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices and potentially causing
reputational harm to PNC.

– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of
agreements with governmental agencies.
– Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses,
including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital
management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
• Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address
environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those
presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as
well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing,
which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also
impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe
weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or
disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control
through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party
vendors and service providers specifically.
We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere
in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
