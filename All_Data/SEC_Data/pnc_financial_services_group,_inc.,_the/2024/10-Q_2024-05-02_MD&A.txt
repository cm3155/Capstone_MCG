Signature Bank Portfolio Acquisition
On October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an
agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately
$16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition.
Workforce Reduction
During the fourth quarter of 2023, PNC implemented a workforce reduction that is expected to reduce 2024 personnel expense by
approximately $325 million, on a pre-tax basis. PNC incurred expenses of $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection
with this workforce reduction.

Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. In the first
quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses.
PNC incurred a pre-tax expense of $515 million during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Income Statement Highlights
Net income of $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024 increased $461 million, or 52%, compared
to $0.9 billion, or $1.85 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, due to lower noninterest expense and a lower
provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest and noninterest income.
• For the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023:
• Total revenue decreased $216 million, or 4%, to $5.1 billion.
• Net interest income of $3.3 billion decreased $139 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased funding costs,
lower loan balances and one fewer day in the quarter.
• Net interest margin declined 9 basis points to 2.57%, primarily as a result of higher funding costs.
• Noninterest income decreased $77 million, or 4%, primarily due to lower capital markets and advisory
activity and seasonal declines in card and cash management fees. The first quarter also included negative
Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value adjustments of $7 million. Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value
adjustments were negative $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.
• Provision for credit losses of $155 million in the first quarter of 2024 reflected portfolio activity and improved
macroeconomic factors. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a provision for credit losses of $232 million.
• Noninterest expense decreased $740 million, or 18%, to $3.3 billion, driven by lower or stable expenses across all
categories, reflecting a continued focus on expense management. The first quarter of 2024 included an additional
pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. The fourth quarter of 2023
included $515 million pertaining to the FDIC special assessment as well as $150 million of workforce reduction
charges.
Net income decreased $350 million, or 21%, compared to $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023
driven by lower net interest and noninterest income, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses.
• For the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023:
• Total revenue decreased $458 million, or 8%, to $5.1 billion.
• Net interest income decreased $321 million, or 9%, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was
more than offset by increased funding costs.
• Net interest margin decreased 27 basis points, primarily as a result of higher funding costs.
• Noninterest income decreased $137 million, or 7%, and included a decline in private equity revenue and
residential and commercial mortgage revenue, partially offset by growth in card and cash management and
asset management and brokerage fees. Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value adjustments were negative $45
million in the first quarter of 2023.
• Provision for credit losses of $155 million for the first three months of 2024 reflected portfolio activity and
improved macroeconomic factors. The first three months of 2023 included a provision for credit losses of $235
million.
• Noninterest expense was stable compared to the first three months of 2023. The first quarter of 2024 included an
additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3 
Balance Sheet Highlights
Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at March 31, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:
• Total assets of $566.2 billion increased modestly primarily due to higher balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank,
partially offset by lower securities and loan balances.
• Total loans decreased $1.7 billion, or 1%, to $319.8 billion.
• Total commercial loans decreased $0.7 billion, to $218.8 billion, driven by paydowns outpacing new production and
lower utilization of loan commitments.
• Total consumer loans declined $1.0 billion to $100.9 billion, as paydowns outpaced new originations and draws on
existing accounts.
• Investment securities decreased $2.1 billion, or 2%, to $130.5 billion, primarily due to prepayments and maturities outpacing
purchases.
• Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $9.8 billion, or 22%, to $53.6
billion, primarily due to an increase in deposits and a decrease in securities and loans balances.
• Total deposits increased $4.2 billion, to $425.6 billion, reflecting higher commercial and consumer deposits. Noninterestbearing deposit balances decreased driven by a decline in commercial noninterest-bearing balances. Interest-bearing deposits
increased reflecting higher commercial and consumer interest-bearing balances.
• Borrowed funds were largely stable at $72.7 billion, as parent company senior debt issuances were offset by lower FHLB
borrowings.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.
Credit Quality Highlights
The first quarter of 2024 reflected stable credit quality performance.
• At March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:
• Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $109 million, or 8%, driven by lower consumer and commercial
loan delinquencies.
• The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related
commitments, totaled $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During
the three months ended March 31, 2024, this reserve was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as
portfolio activity. ACL to total loans was 1.68% and 1.70% at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
• Nonperforming assets increased $199 million, or 9%, to $2.4 billion, primarily due to higher commercial real estate
nonperforming loans.
• Net charge-offs of $243 million, or 0.30% of average loans, in the first quarter of 2024 increased $43 million compared to the
fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher commercial net loan charge-offs.
For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
Capital and Liquidity Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
• Common shareholders’ equity of $45.1 billion at March 31, 2024, increased $0.2 billion, compared to December 31, 2023
due to the benefit of net income, partially offset by common dividends paid, a decline in AOCI and common share
repurchases.
• In the first quarter of 2024, PNC returned $0.8 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting more than $0.6 billion of
dividends on common shares and more than $0.1 billion of common share repurchases, representing 0.9 million shares.
• Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our
Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100
million common shares, of which approximately 44% were still available for repurchase at March 31, 2024. In light of the
Federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework, second quarter 2024 share repurchase
activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average share repurchase levels. PNC continues to evaluate the potential
impact of the proposed rules and may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well
as other factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
• On April 3, 2024, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.55 per share to be
paid on May 6, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business April 15, 2024.
• Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.1% at March 31, 2024 from 9.9% at December 31, 2023.
• PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay through December 31, 2021 the full
impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first
quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being
4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of
CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 10.0%
at March 31, 2024 compared to 9.8% at December 31, 2023.
See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our
liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios.
PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an
SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional
information, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation
section in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our views that:
• PNC’s baseline forecast is for slower economic growth in 2024 as consumer spending growth slows and higher interest rates
remain a drag on the economy. The ongoing strength of the labor market will continue to support consumer spending. The
FOMC is indicating that it will start to cut the federal funds rate later this year, with rate cuts supporting economic growth
toward the end of 2024.
• Real GDP growth this year will be close to its trend of 2% and the unemployment rate will increase modestly to just above
4% by the end of 2024. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, moving back to the Federal Reserve’s 2%
long-term objective by the end of 2025.
• PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50% through at least the first half of 2024,
with federal funds rate cuts starting in the third quarter as inflationary pressures ease further. PNC expects two federal funds
rate cuts in 2024, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.75% and 5.00%.
For the second quarter of 2024, compared to the first quarter of 2024, we expect:
• Average loans to be stable,
• Net interest income to be down approximately 1%,
• Fee income to be up 1% to 2%,
• Other noninterest income to be $150 million to $200 million,
• Revenue to be stable,
• Core noninterest expense to be up 2% to 4%, and
• Net loan charge-offs to be $225 million to $275 million.
For the full year 2024, compared to the full year of 2023, we expect:
• Average loans to be up approximately 1%,
• Net interest income to be down 4% to 5%,
• Noninterest income to be up 4% to 6%,
• Revenue to be stable to down 2%,
• Core noninterest expense to be stable, and
• The effective tax rate to be approximately 18.5%.
Core noninterest expense guidance excludes an additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s
expected losses in the first quarter of 2024, and $515 million pertaining to the FDIC special assessment as well as $150 million of
workforce reduction charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Reconciliation of
Core Noninterest Expense (non-GAAP) section of this Report. Other noninterest income, noninterest income and revenue guidance
excludes net securities gains and Visa activity.
We are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, without unreasonable
effort, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and
amounts necessary for the reconciliation when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our
Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors
included in our 2023 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report.
Net income of $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024 increased $461 million, or 52%, compared
to $0.9 billion, or $1.85 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, due to lower noninterest expense and a lower
provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest and noninterest income. Net income decreased $350 million, or 21%,
compared to $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per diluted common share for the same period in 2023, driven by lower net interest and noninterest
income, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in
Item 1 of this Report.
(b) Interest income from Interest-earning deposits with banks primarily includes interest earned on our balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank and is reported as Other
interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.
Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and
related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical
Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional
information.
Net interest income decreased $139 million, or 4%, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due
to increased funding costs, lower loan balances and one fewer day in the quarter. Net interest income decreased $321 million, or 9%,
for the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was more
than offset by increased funding costs. Net interest margin declined 9 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and 27 basis
points compared to the first quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of higher funding costs.
Average investment securities of $135.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024 declined $2.0 billion, or 1%, and $8.0 billion, or 6%, from
the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. In both comparisons, limited purchase activity was more than
offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. Average investment securities represented 26% of average interest-earning assets for the
first quarter of 2024 compared to 27% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 28% for the first quarter of 2023.
Average loans for the first quarter of 2024 decreased $4.0 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, due to lower commercial
and consumer loans. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, average loans decreased $4.9 billion, or 2%, primarily due to lower
commercial loans. Average loans represented 63% of average interest-earning assets for both the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth
quarter of 2023, compared to 64% for the first quarter of 2023.
6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Average interest-earning deposits with banks for the first quarter of 2024 increased $5.6 billion, or 13%, compared to the fourth
quarter of 2023 driven by lower loan balances and higher borrowed funds, partially offset by lower deposits. Compared to the first
quarter of 2023, average interest-earning deposits with banks increased $14.2 billion, or 42%, primarily due to higher borrowed funds
and lower securities and loan balances, partially offset by lower deposits.
Average interest-bearing deposits increased $1.9 billion and $6.2 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter
of 2023, respectively. The increase in both comparisons reflected the impact of the higher interest rate environment. In total, average
interest-bearing deposits represented 81% of average interest-bearing liabilities for both the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter
of 2023, compared to 83% for the first quarter of 2023.
Average borrowed funds of $75.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 increased $2.7, billion, or 4%, compared to the fourth quarter of
2023 and $12.6 billion, or 20%, compared to the first quarter of 2023. In both comparisons, the increase was driven primarily by
parent company senior debt issuances.

by the impact of higher average equity markets. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management increased $6 billion and $18
billion compared to December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. In both comparisons, the increase was primarily driven by
higher spot equity markets.
Capital markets and advisory fees declined compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory
activity, partially offset by higher underwriting fees. The decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to lower
trading revenue, partially offset by higher underwriting fees.
Card and cash management revenue decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, as seasonally lower consumer transaction
volumes were partially offset by higher treasury management fees. The increase compared to the first three months of 2023 was
primarily due to higher treasury management product revenue.
Lending and deposit services decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting the reduction of certain checking product
fees. Lending and deposit services were stable compared to the first quarter of 2023.
Residential and commercial mortgage decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and included lower residential mortgage
activity. The decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023 was driven by lower revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for
sale.
Other noninterest income decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and included lower gains on sales. The decrease
compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by a decline in private equity revenue. In both comparisons, the decrease
was offset by lower negative Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value adjustments. Visa Class B-1 fair value adjustments were negative $7
million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to negative $100 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and negative $45 million for the
first quarter of 2023.

Noninterest expense decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by lower or stable expenses across all categories,
reflecting a continued focus on expense management. Noninterest expense was stable compared to the first three months of 2023. The
first quarter of 2024 included an additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. The
fourth quarter of 2023 included $515 million pertaining to the FDIC special assessment as well as $150 million of workforce reduction
charges.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 18.8% in the first quarter of 2024, 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 17.2% in the first quarter

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at March 31, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:
• Total assets increased modestly due to higher balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset by lower securities
and loan balances.
• Total liabilities increased modestly primarily due to higher deposits.
• Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income, partially offset by dividends paid, a decline in AOCI and common
share repurchases.
The ACL related to loans totaled $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the
three months ended March 31, 2024, this reserve was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. See the
following for additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:
• Allowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review,
• Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Financial Review, and
• Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.

capital and regulatory compliance is included in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this

Investment Securities
Investment securities of $130.5 billion at March 31, 2024 decreased $2.1 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily
due to prepayments and maturities outpacing purchases.
The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to
optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

(b) Amortized cost is presented net of the allowance for investment securities, which totaled $93 million at March 31, 2024 and primarily related to non-agency commercial
mortgage-backed securities. The comparable amount at December 31, 2023 was $92 million.

Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at
March 31, 2024 was comparable to December 31, 2023 and primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of
fixed-rate securities. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an
appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the
securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding the allowance for
investment securities.

The duration of investment securities was 4.1 years and 4.2 years at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We
estimate that at March 31, 2024 the effective duration of investment securities was 4.0 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel
increase in interest rates and 4.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at
December 31, 2023 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.1 years and 4.2 years, respectively.
Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.2 years at
March 31, 2024 compared to 5.5 years at December 31, 2023.

Deposits are considered an attractive source of funding due to their stability and relatively low cost to fund. Compared to December
31, 2023, our funding source composition included higher deposit balances and relatively stable borrowed funds.
Total deposits increased reflecting higher commercial and consumer deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased driven
by a decline in commercial noninterest-bearing balances. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial and
consumer interest-bearing balances. This shift in deposit composition, as well as higher deposit rates, contributed to an increase in
funding costs compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our total brokered deposit balances of $10.6 billion at March 31, 2024
decreased compared to $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, and were significantly below both our internal and regulatory guidelines
and limits.
Borrowed funds were largely stable as parent company senior debt issuances were offset by lower FHLB borrowings.
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, capital
considerations, and funding needs, which are primarily driven by changes in loan, deposit and investment securities balances. While
our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses, we also
manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and
NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of
the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital activities. See
Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 9 Borrowed Funds in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to our

borrowings. See Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in the Statistical Information section of this Report
for additional information on volume and related funding cost changes.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity was $51.3 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to December 31, 2023, as
increases related to net income of $1.3 billion were partially offset by dividends paid of $0.7 billion, a decline in AOCI of $0.3 billion
and more than $0.1 billion of common share repurchases.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW
We have three reportable business segments:
• Retail Banking
• Corporate & Institutional Banking
• Asset Management Group
Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in
Other, as shown in Table 77 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Other includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for
disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses,
ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments,
intercompany eliminations, corporate overhead net of allocations, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited
businesses and the residual impact from funds transfer pricing operations.
Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the
presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
See Note 14 Segment Reporting for additional information on our business segments, including a description of each business.

Retail Banking earnings for the first three months of 2024 increased $0.4 billion compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to
higher revenue and a lower provision for credit losses, as well as lower noninterest expense.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
declines in average deposit balances.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison, reflecting lower negative Visa Class B-1 derivative fair value adjustments, partially
offset by lower card and cash management fees.
Provision for credit losses reflected the impact of portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, and included lower personnel expense.
Retail Banking average total loans remained stable in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Average
consumer loans decreased driven by lower residential real estate as a result of paydowns outpacing new volume, as well as continued
declines in education loans from runoff in the government guaranteed portfolio. Average commercial loans increased due to growth in
automobile dealer segment balances.
Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and
retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on
retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate-sensitive
customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first three
months of 2024, average total deposits decreased compared to the same period in 2023, reflecting the impact of quantitative tightening
by the Federal Reserve and competitive pricing dynamics.
Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for
consumers and small businesses.
As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate and continue to optimize a coast-tocoast network of retail branches and ATMs, which are complemented by PNC’s suite of digital capabilities. In February 2024, PNC
announced it would be investing nearly $1.0 billion, through 2028, to open more than 100 new branches in key locations, including
Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, and San Antonio, and to renovate more than 1,200 existing locations across the country to
enhance the customer experience.

fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale.
(d) Represents net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing, net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to time and payoffs. Commercial

(e) As of March 31.
(f) Represents balances related to capitalized servicing.
(g) As the result of a business realignment within C&IB during the second quarter of 2023, certain loans were reclassified from Other to Corporate Banking in the prior period to
conform to the current period presentation.
Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first three months of 2024 increased $62 million compared to the same period in
2023 driven by higher net interest income and a decline in noninterest expense, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average loan and deposit balances.
Noninterest income remained stable, as higher treasury management product revenue was largely offset by lower commercial
mortgage banking activities.
Provision for credit losses reflected portfolio activity and improved macroeconomic factors.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, reflecting a continued focus on expense management.
Average loans decreased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023:
• Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to
mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business decreased
driven by lower average utilization of loan commitments and paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by the
acquisition of capital commitment facilities from Signature Bridge Bank in the fourth quarter of 2023.
• Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average
loans for this business declined largely due to paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by a higher average
utilization of loan commitments.
• Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is mainly
secured by business assets. Average loans for this business declined primarily driven by a lower average utilization of loan
commitments.
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets related products and services to smaller
corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined primarily driven by paydowns outpacing new
production and a lower average utilization of loan commitments.
The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining
relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to
provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits decreased compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023,
reflecting the impact of quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and competitive pricing dynamics. We continue to actively
monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank
funding needs and client relationship dynamics.
Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including
treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers
of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and
noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is
reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses
where the customer relationships exist. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for
treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services
follows.
The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and
disbursement management services, funds transfer services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting
services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes
treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for
products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management customer deposit balances.
Compared to the first three months of 2023, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of
deposits and higher product revenue.
16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and
noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total
revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to higher commercial mortgage
servicing income, partially offset by lower revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale.
Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital
markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The increase in
capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was mostly driven by higher underwriting fees and merger and acquisition
advisory fees, partially offset by lower customer-related trading revenue for derivatives.

municipalities and non-profits.
18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Asset Management Group earnings in the first three months of 2024 increased $45 million compared to the same period in 2023,
primarily driven by higher net interest income, a decline in noninterest expense and a provision recapture.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and an increase in
average loan and deposit balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
Noninterest income was stable as increases in noninterest income from advances in the average equity markets were offset by the
impact of client activity.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, reflecting a continued focus on expense management.
Average loans increased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily driven by growth in residential mortgage
loans.
Average deposits increased in the comparison reflecting growth in CD and deposit sweep balances, partially offset by the impact of
quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and redeployment of funds to assets under management.
Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher equity markets as of
March 31, 2024.

measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan
classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 19 
Commercial
Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 55% of our total loan portfolio at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The
majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment should a
borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable,
inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business assets.
We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of
the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity
in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to
monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies
that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following
table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).

(a) Represents loans to customers in the real estate and construction industries.
Owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $9.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and are included in commercial and industrial
loans as the credit decisioning for servicing these loans is based on the financial conditions of the owner; not the ability of the
collateral to generate income. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans are well-diversified across industries. The comparable
amount of owner occupied commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2023 was $9.6 billion.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans comprised $20.8 billion related to commercial mortgages on income-producing properties, $8.5 billion of
intermediate-term financing loans, and $6.3 billion of real estate construction project loans as of March 31, 2024. Comparable
amounts as of December 31, 2023 were $21.0 billion, $8.0 billion, and $6.4 billion, respectively. Commercial real estate primarily
consists of an investment in land and/or buildings held to generate income, that income serves as the primary source for the repayment
of the loan. However, for all commercial real estate assets, the disposition of the assigned collateral serves as a secondary source of
repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties.
We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD
and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location
and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The
portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

Commercial Real Estate: Office Portfolio
Given the foundational change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, real estate performance related to the office
sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. At March 31, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $7.8
billion, or 2.4% of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.3 billion. Also, the portfolio is well diversified
geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. Within the office portfolio at March 31, 2024, criticized loans totaled 26.4% and
nonperforming loans totaled 10.5%, while delinquencies were zero. As measured at origination, the weighted average LTV for the
office portfolio was 58%; however, updated appraisals have increased the weighted average LTV to 69% as of March 31, 2024. While
LTV is one consideration, our risk assessment considers a number of factors in assessing the changing conditions affecting the
portfolio. As of March 31, 2024, we have established reserves of 9.7% against office loans.
The greatest stress in our office portfolio is observed in multi-tenant office loans, which represents 57% of the portfolio at March 31,
2024. Within the multi-tenant classification, criticized levels were 45.1% while nonperforming loans totaled 18.1%, accounting for
almost all of the nonperforming office population. The weighted average LTV for multi-tenant is 75% at March 31, 2024.
Additionally, commercial real estate charge-offs since the beginning of 2023 have primarily been multi-tenant office loans. Given the
higher level of stress, this segment has a proportionally higher reserve rate of 14.4%. The remaining 43% of the office portfolio is
primarily comprised of single-tenant, medical and government tenant properties. This subset of the portfolio is performing
considerably better, with approximately 1% of the book in the criticized and nonperforming loan categories. As of March 31, 2024, the
weighted average LTV of this book is 59%.
Portfolio management efforts have escalated for the office portfolio, with internal risk ratings completed for each asset quarterly,
accelerated reappraisal requirements and elevated approval levels for any credit action. Refreshed appraisals have updated valuations
on nearly all of the criticized office exposure since the beginning of 2023. Additionally, active management efforts include ongoing
performance assessments as well as the review of property, lending and capital markets. Portfolio updates are distributed to senior
management weekly.
Given the ongoing change in this area, we expect additional stress in the office sector, and a portion of this stress will bear itself out as
we work through maturities that will approximate 42% over the next twelve months. Upon maturity, and where the balance is not paid
in full, an extension may be granted because contractual extension terms are met; alternatively, an extension may be granted based on
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 21 
negotiated terms, and a portion of these extensions may involve the curtailment or charge off of principal. We continue to actively
manage the portfolio, and we believe reserve levels adequately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio.
Commercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio
As of March 31, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the multifamily portfolio totaled $16.1 billion, or 5.0% of total loans, while
additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $3.8 billion. Although inflationary pressures and higher interest rates have impacted
internal risk assessments and regulatory classification in this portfolio, we have not seen a notable change in loan performance at this
time with regards to nonperformance, delinquency or charge-offs. We continue to closely monitor our exposure in this sector.
Consumer
Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least
quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g.,
nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network.
Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with
servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we
retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $42.4 billion at March 31,
2024, with 46% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $42.4 billion and 45%, respectively.
Home Equity
Home equity loans comprised $20.6 billion of home equity lines of credit and $5.3 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans
at March 31, 2024. Comparable amounts were $20.6 billion and $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, respectively. Home equity lines
of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available to certain borrowers.
Similar to residential real estate loans, we track borrower performance of this portfolio on a monthly basis. We also segment the
population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit
or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of
22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis
and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy
status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.
The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of
the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at
the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to
obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

Automobile
Auto loans comprised $13.8 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and $1.0 billion in the direct auto portfolio as of March 31, 2024.
Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2023 were $13.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio consists of
loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including dealers located in our newer markets. This business is
strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores
noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At March 31, 2024, the
portfolio balance was composed of 43% new vehicle loans and 57% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023
were 45% and 55%, respectively.
The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including both updated collateral values and FICO scores that are
obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type
and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the
portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.
Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans
accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent full collection of contractual principal and interest is
not probable. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option
are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for details on our nonaccrual
policies.

Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio.
Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due are
considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value
option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given
current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment, such as inflation
levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular
changes fostered by the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan modifications and collection
programs to assist our customers.
The following table presents a summary of accruing loans past due by delinquency status:

(a) Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.4 billion at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the
process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines,
or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
Loan Modifications
We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease
modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship
relief programs.
See Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on loan modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, the reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction
characteristics and assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date. We maintain the ACL at an
appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and
unfunded lending related commitments.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the Credit Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of our
ACL, including details of our methodologies. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for
further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of March 31, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Management
Our liquidity risk framework and related monitoring measures and tools, including internal liquidity stress testing as well as
compliance with internal and regulatory limits and guidelines, are described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management
section of our 2023 Form 10-K.
One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical
30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the first quarter of 2024. Fluctuations in
our average LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash outflows,
as a result of ongoing business activity.
The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
NSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the first quarter of 2024.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 27 
We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These
deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $425.6 billion at March 31, 2024 from $421.4
billion at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased driven by a decline in commercial noninterest-bearing
balances. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial and consumer interest-bearing balances. As of March 31,
2024, uninsured deposits represented approximately 43% of our total deposit base, which is estimated based on the regulatory
instructions in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031. The majority of our uninsured deposits are related to
commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers who utilize two or more PNC
products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and Business Segments Review sections of this
Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
We may also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB
borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings). See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review and Note 7
Borrowed Funds in this Report for additional information related to our borrowings.
Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:

In billions 2024
January 1 $ 31.7
Issuances 2.5
Calls and maturities (1.1)
Other (0.4)
March 31 $ 32.7
Additionally, certain liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity
position. PNC has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and
commitments, particularly in the event of liquidity stress. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity
under various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan’s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides
the strategies for addressing liquidity needs and responsive actions we would consider during liquidity stress events, which could
include the issuance of incremental debt, preferred stock, or additional deposit actions, including the issuance of brokered CDs. The
plan also addresses the governance, frequency of reporting and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of liquidity stress.
PNC defines our primary contingent liquidity sources as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities and unused
borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. The following table summarizes our primary contingent liquidity sources
at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Total available contingent liquidity $ 231.2 $ 224.4
(a) Represents the fair value of investment securities that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.
(b) At March 31, 2024, total FHLB borrowing capacity was $74.4 billion and total FHLB borrowings were $37.0 billion. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $73.4
billion and $38.0 billion, respectively.
(c) Total borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank was $83.9 billion at March 31, 2024 and $47.2 billion at December 31, 2023. PNC had no outstanding borrowings
with the Federal Reserve Bank at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
As part of PNC’s contingency planning, we prepositioned a portion of our available held to maturity investment securities at the
Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window during the first quarter of 2024, supporting our resilience and operational readiness.
28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Bank Liquidity
In addition to our primary contingent liquidity sources, under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from
time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated
notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes)
from their date of issue. At March 31, 2024, PNC Bank’s remaining capacity to issue under the program was $33.3 billion.
Under PNC Bank’s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to
provide additional liquidity. At March 31, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or issuing
intercompany senior unsecured notes.
Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we manage the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the
parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases
and acquisitions.
At March 31, 2024, available parent company liquidity totaled $21.7 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash
and investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the
maturity of parent company debt obligations.
The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may
be impacted by the following:
• Bank-level capital needs,
• Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
• Corporate policies,
• Contractual restrictions, and
• Other factors.
There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to
extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the
parent company without prior regulatory approval was $5.7 billion at March 31, 2024. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023
Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.
In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends
and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for
the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital
instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company’s 2014 commercial paper program, the
parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At March 31, 2024, there
were no issuances outstanding under this program.
The following table details parent company note issuances in the first quarter of 2024:
Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued

beginning on July 21, 2024. Beginning on January 21, 2027, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a
floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest

beginning on July 22, 2024. Beginning on January 22, 2034, interest is payable quarterly in arrears at a
floating rate per annum equal to Compounded SOFR (determined with respect to each quarterly interest
period using the SOFR Index as described in the Prospectus Supplement), plus 1.902%, on April 22, 2034,
July 22, 2034, October 22, 2034 and at the maturity date.
Parent company senior and subordinated debt carrying value totaled $25.0 billion and $24.0 billion at March 31, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and
postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section
of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we have
various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 8 Commitments.
Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative
instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset
quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the
cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on the potential impacts from a
downgrade to our credit ratings, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item
1 of our 2023 Form 10-K.
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming
debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and
managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
In the first quarter of 2024, PNC returned $0.8 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting more than $0.6 billion of dividends on
common shares and more than $0.1 billion of common share repurchases, representing 0.9 million shares. Consistent with the SCB
framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a
repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which
approximately 44% were still available for repurchase at March 31, 2024. In light of the Federal banking agencies proposed rules to
adjust the Basel III capital framework, second quarter of 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate the recent quarterly
average share repurchase levels. PNC continues to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rules and may adjust share repurchase
activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning
October 1, 2023 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
On April 3, 2024 the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.55 per share to be paid on
May 6, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business April 15, 2024.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year
transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.
(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both
on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under
the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.
Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject
to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory
capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in
retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for
PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional
discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.
At March 31, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and
10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 riskbased capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31 
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital
well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage
our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our March 31, 2024 capital levels were aligned with them.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts, including the
proposed rules to adjust the Basel III framework, in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors
and Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding
market risk.
Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors,
including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the
interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due
to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only
affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk
management policies, which are approved by management’s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
PNC utilizes sensitivities of NII and EVE to a set of interest rate scenarios to identify and measure its short-term and long-term
structural interest rate risks.
NII Sensitivity results for the first quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow:

200 basis point instantaneous increase (0.2) % 2.5 %
200 basis point instantaneous decrease (0.2) % (3.3) %
(a) The effect on NII in the first year from a 100 basis point instantaneous increase or decrease is not materially different from the 200 basis point scenarios as disclosed above.
When forecasting net interest income, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including
the following:
Future Balance Sheet Composition: Our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations. As of the
first quarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot composition
as of the first quarter of 2024.
Deposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate, with the relationship between
deposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined as deposit beta. We define cumulative deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on
interest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate range since the first
quarter of 2022, the start of the current rising rate cycle. As of March 31, 2024 PNC’s cumulative deposit beta was 45%, an increase
from 35% at March 31, 2023. For interest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity
depending on market rate levels as well as other factors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience and future
expectations. Our scenario assumes that deposit betas increased slightly from current levels. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from
modeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer behavior.
Asset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios. Mortgage and home equity
portfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments. Commercial and
consumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios
historically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates.
Impact of Derivatives: PNC uses interest rate derivatives to hedge floating rate commercial loans. PNC had $36.5 billion in receive
fix / pay float swaps as of March 31, 2024, with a weighted average duration of 2.0 years and an average fixed rate of 2.30%. As of
March 31, 2024 PNC also had collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of floors, that are used to hedge these

commercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix / pay float swaps as a means of hedging fixed rate debt. See Note 12
Financial Derivatives in this report for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans and fixed rate
debt.
EVE sensitivity results for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 follow:
Table 32: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Analysis
First Quarter 2024 First Quarter 2023
Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Simulation
200 basis point instantaneous increase (5.7) % (4.3) %
200 basis point instantaneous decrease (1.6) % (4.9) %
EVE measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include
projected new volume. EVE sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to NII sensitivity analysis and represents an
estimation of long-term interest rate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates. Similar to
the NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions. These methodologies are
largely consistent between the EVE and NII sensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit attrition is a significant contributor to EVE
sensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected based on a dynamic model developed using long-term historical deposit behavior in addition
to management assumptions including accelerated attrition for pandemic related excess deposits. PNC performs various sensitivity
analyses to understand the impact of faster and slower deposit attrition on our risk metrics, with the results reported to ALCO.
Compared to the first quarter of 2023, there have been no material changes to our NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,
including data sources that drive assumptions setting.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging
activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are
marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate
the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the
portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market
Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits. See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2023 Form 10-K for more
information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.
Customer-related trading revenue was $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $84 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower derivative client sales revenues, partially offset by securities
underwriting client revenues.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to
extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in
a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also
have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory
limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment
decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.
A summary of our equity investments follows:

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax
credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2023 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit
investments.
Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid
portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity
investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $2.2 billion at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024,
$2.0 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity
funds.
Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B-1 common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B-1 common
shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded
Class A common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation, subject to the exchange offer
described in Note 16 Subsequent Events. Based upon the March 31, 2024 per share closing price of $279.08 for a Visa Class A
common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the Class B-1 common shares was approximately $1.6 billion at the
current conversion rate of Visa B-1 shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was insignificant. The estimated value does not
represent fair value of the Visa B-1 common shares given the shares’ limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in
the marketplace. See Note 14 Fair Value and Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K and Note 13 Legal Proceedings in
this Report for additional information regarding our Visa agreements. See Note 16 Subsequent Events for additional details on Visa’s
recently announced exchange offer for Visa Class B-1 common stock.
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with
both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains (losses) related to these investments were $(6) million for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.
Financial Derivatives
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to
market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to
facilitate their risk management activities.
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a
notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount on these instruments.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15 Financial
Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be
ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.
RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Federal agencies and states, including the federal agencies responsible for the Federal Acquisition Regulations, California, and most
recently in March 2024, the SEC, have separately proposed or finalized rules that would require certain companies or government
contractors, such as PNC or PNC Bank, to disclose significant amounts of climate-related information. This information includes
qualitative and quantitative disclosures of material climate-related risks and their impact, governance and management, targets and
goals, and greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions disclosures include the company’s direct emissions from owned
or controlled sources (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from the company’s consumption of energy purchased from third parties
(Scope 2), and in the case of the Federal Acquisition Regulations proposal for a “major contractor” and California laws, disclosures
related to indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in the company’s value chain (Scope 3). If and when all the
rules are finalized, PNC and PNC Bank may face potentially differing standards from the agencies or California. Numerous lawsuits
have challenged the SEC and California rules, and on April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed implementation of its final rules
pending resolution of the lawsuits challenging the SEC rules.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023
Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or
economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and
commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023
Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our
existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for
the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated
recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and
transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of
future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these
factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and
other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best
estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major
drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:
• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As
current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
• Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic
forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to the probability weights assigned to
these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
• Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics,
including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially
affected.
• Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of
one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Pursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses.
For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios
with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in
our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to
them.
To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic
forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forwardlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within
that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution
and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected
economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each
quarter, the scenarios and their respective weights are presented to RAC for approval.
The scenarios used for the period ended March 31, 2024 consider, among other factors, ongoing inflationary pressures and the
corresponding tightness of monetary policy and credit availability. While recession risks remain elevated, our most-likely expectation
at March 31, 2024 is that the U.S. economy narrowly avoids a recession in 2024.
We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.
unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average
scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35 
Table 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios
Assumptions as of March 31, 2024
2024 2025 2026
U.S. real GDP (a) 0.8% 1.7% 2.1%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.6% 4.8% 4.3%
Assumptions as of December 31, 2023
2024 2025 2026
U.S. real GDP (a) 0.1% 1.5% 2.0%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.5% 4.6% 4.2%
(a) Represents year-over-year growth (loss) rates.
(b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.
Real GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at 0.8% on a weighted average basis, up from the 0.1% assumed at December 31, 2023,
primarily due to stronger expected economic activity in 2024 than what was expected at the end of 2023. Growth then rises to 1.7% in
2025, before growing to 2.1% in 2026. The weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to end 2024 at 4.6%, up slightly from
the 4.5% assumed at December 31, 2023. During the second half of 2025, the weighted-average unemployment increases to a peak of
5.0% before gradually improving to 4.8% by the fourth quarter of 2025. Further improvement is then expected in 2026 with the rate
reaching 4.3% by the fourth quarter of 2026.
The current state of the economy continues to reflect uncertainty due to the foundational change in office demand from the acceptance
of remote work, combined with inflationary pressures, interest rate movements, and declining consumer savings and deposit balances.
As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analyses around segments
impacted by such uncertainties to ensure our reserves are adequate, given our current macroeconomic expectations.
We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth
and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment.
Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance
sheet date.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial
performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial
position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are
typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,”
“forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.
Forward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Future
events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which
our forward-looking statements are subject. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty
and do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly
materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance. As a result, we caution
against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.
• Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including:
– Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,
– Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,
– Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact
money supply, market interest rates and inflation,
– Changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory
initiatives,
– Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,
– Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
– Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital
markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
– Our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
– Commodity price volatility.
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our views that:
– PNC’s baseline forecast is for slower economic growth in 2024 as consumer spending growth slows and higher
interest rates remain a drag on the economy. The ongoing strength of the labor market will continue to support
consumer spending. The FOMC is indicating that it will start to cut the federal funds rate later this year, with rate
cuts supporting economic growth toward the end of 2024.
– Real GDP growth this year will be close to its trend of 2% and the unemployment rate will increase modestly to just
above 4% by the end of 2024. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, moving back to the Federal
Reserve’s 2% long-term objective by the end of 2025.
– PNC expects the federal funds rate to remain unchanged between 5.25% and 5.50% through at least the first half of
2024, with federal funds rate cuts starting in the third quarter as inflationary pressures ease further. PNC expects two
federal funds rate cuts in 2024, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.75% and 5.00%.
• PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or
exceeding minimum capital levels, including a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection
with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.
• PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, PNC’s financial performance, the scope and
terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In
addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital
distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and
regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results
of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could
affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These
developments could include:
– Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in
the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations and changes in accounting and reporting standards.
38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or
other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices and potentially causing
reputational harm to PNC.
– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of
agreements with governmental agencies.
– Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses,
including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital
management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
• Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address
environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those
presented by the nature of the business acquired or strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry
into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well
as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the acquired
businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing,
which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also
impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe
weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or
disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control
through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party
vendors and service providers specifically.
We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report, including in the
Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated
Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including
those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
