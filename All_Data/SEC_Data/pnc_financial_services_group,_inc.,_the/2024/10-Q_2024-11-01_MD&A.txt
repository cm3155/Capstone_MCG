EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial institutions in the U.S. We have businesses
engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many
of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. We also have strategic international offices
in four countries outside the U.S.
Key Strategic Goals
At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and
revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in
our products, markets and brand, and embrace our commitments to our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities
where we do business.
We strive to serve our customers and expand and deepen relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, credit and fee-based
products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services to our customers with the goal of addressing their
financial objectives and needs. Our business model is built on customer loyalty and engagement, understanding our customers’
financial goals and offering our diverse products and services to help them achieve financial well-being. Our approach is concentrated
on organically growing and deepening client relationships across our businesses that meet our risk/return measures.
We are focused on our strategic priorities, which are designed to enhance value over the long term, and consist of:
• Expanding our leading banking franchise to new markets and digital platforms,
• Deepening customer relationships by delivering a superior banking experience and financial solutions, and
• Leveraging technology to create efficiencies that help us better serve customers.
Our capital and liquidity priorities are to support customers, fund business investments and return excess capital to shareholders, while
maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity in light of economic conditions, the Basel III framework and other regulatory
expectations. For more detail, see the Capital and Liquidity Highlights portion of this Executive Summary, the Liquidity and Capital
Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1
Business of our 2023 Form 10-K.
Signature Bank Portfolio Acquisition
On October 2, 2023, PNC acquired a portfolio of capital commitments facilities from Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. through an
agreement with the FDIC as receiver of the former Signature Bank, New York. The acquired portfolio represented approximately
$16.0 billion in total commitments, including approximately $9.0 billion of funded loans, at the time of acquisition.
Workforce Reduction
During the fourth quarter of 2023, PNC implemented a workforce reduction that is expected to reduce 2024 personnel expense by
approximately $325 million, on a pre-tax basis. PNC incurred expenses of $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection
with this workforce reduction.
1 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
FDIC Special Assessment
In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance
Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. As a result,
PNC incurred a pre-tax expense of $515 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, PNC incurred an
additional pre-tax expense of $130 million related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses. As of September 30, 2024, we have
not recorded any further incremental expense related to recent FDIC assessments.
Second Quarter 2024 Significant Items
In the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1 common
shares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. This conversion event
resulted in a gain of $754 million related to the Visa Class C common shares received. PNC retained the Visa Class B-2 common
shares. The second quarter of 2024 also included Visa Class B-2 derivative fair value adjustments of negative $116 million and a $120
million expense related to a PNC Foundation contribution. During the second quarter, PNC also repositioned the investment securities
portfolio, selling low-yielding investment securities for net proceeds of $3.8 billion, resulting in a loss of $497 million. PNC
redeployed the full proceeds from the sale into higher-yielding investment securities. The combined impact to pre-tax noninterest
income and pre-tax noninterest expense was $141 million and $120 million, respectively.
Hurricanes Helene and Milton
During the last week of September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida’s panhandle, impacting a large region of the
southeastern United States, including the southern Appalachians. In the second week of October 2024, Hurricane Milton made landfall
on the central west coast of Florida, causing widespread damage across the state. The storms resulted in property damage to our
customers, the closing or disruption of many businesses, including some of PNC’s branches and facilities and damage to the
community infrastructure. We continue to evaluate the impact to our businesses, and, based on our assessments to date, we do not
expect these storms to have a material impact on our operating results, including credit losses.

Income Statement Highlights
Net income of $1.5 billion, or $3.49 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024 increased $28 million, or 2%, compared
to $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher net interest income, partially
offset by lower noninterest income.
• For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024:
• Total revenue of $5.4 billion was stable.
• Net interest income of $3.4 billion increased $108 million, or 3%, driven by higher yields on interestearning assets.
• Net interest margin increased 4 basis points to 2.64%.
• Noninterest income decreased $87 million, or 4%, as lower other noninterest income was partially offset by
strong capital markets and advisory revenue. Other noninterest income included Visa derivative fair value
adjustments of negative $128 million, primarily related to litigation escrow funding. The second quarter of
2024 included the benefit of $141 million of significant items.
• Provision for credit losses of $243 million in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected the impact of portfolio
activity. The second quarter of 2024 included a provision for credit losses of $235 million.
• Noninterest expense decreased $30 million to $3.3 billion as increased personnel costs, reflecting higher variable
compensation related to increased business activity, were more than offset by a PNC Foundation contribution
expense of $120 million in the second quarter of 2024.
Net income of $4.3 billion, or $9.98 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2024 decreased $438 million, or 9%,
compared to $4.8 billion, or $10.94 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2023 primarily driven by lower net interest
income and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest income.
• For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023:
• Total revenue decreased $141 million, to $16.0 billion.
• Net interest income decreased $537 million, or 5%, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was
more than offset by increased funding costs.
• Net interest margin decreased 18 basis points.
• Noninterest income increased $396 million, or 7%, primarily driven by higher capital markets and advisory
fees.
• Provision for credit losses of $633 million in the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity
partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook. The first nine months of 2023 included a provision for
credit losses of $510 million.
• Noninterest expense increased $80 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a $130
million pre-tax expense in the first quarter of 2024 related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses, as well as a
second quarter PNC Foundation contribution expense.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Financial Review.
Balance Sheet Highlights
Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at September 30, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:
• Total assets of $564.9 billion were stable reflecting higher securities balances, partially offset by lower balances held with the
Federal Reserve Bank.
• Total loans of $321.4 billion were stable.
• Total commercial loans increased $1.2 billion to $220.7 billion due to new production, largely related to multifamily
agency warehouse lending.
• Total consumer loans decreased $1.3 billion to $100.7 billion, as growth in automobile loans was more than offset
by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns outpaced originations as well as lower utilization.
• Investment securities increased $11.6 billion, or 9%, to $144.2 billion due to increased net purchase activity, primarily of
U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.
• Interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased $8.8 billion, or 20%, to $35.0
billion, driven by higher securities balances and lower borrowed funds.
• Total deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 1%, to $424.0 billion reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by
lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset
by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and
consumer balances.
• Borrowed funds decreased $4.7 billion, or 6%, to $68.1 billion due to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent
company senior debt issuances.
For additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.

Credit Quality Highlights
The third quarter of 2024 reflected relatively stable credit quality performance.
• At September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023:
• Overall loan delinquencies of $1.3 billion decreased $109 million, or 8%, driven by lower consumer and commercial
loan delinquencies.
• The ACL related to loans, which consists of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related
commitments, totaled $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The
decrease in the comparison was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. ACL to
total loans was 1.65% and 1.70% at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
• Nonperforming assets increased $0.4 billion, or 18%, to $2.6 billion, primarily due to higher commercial real estate
nonperforming loans.
• Net loan charge-offs of $286 million, or 0.36% of average loans, in the third quarter of 2024 increased $24 million compared
to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower commercial recoveries.
For additional detail see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
Capital and Liquidity Highlights
We maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions.
• Common shareholders’ equity of $49.4 billion at September 30, 2024 increased $4.5 billion compared to December 31, 2023,
due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by common dividends paid and common
shares repurchased.
• In the third quarter of 2024, PNC returned $0.8 billion of capital to shareholders, including more than $0.6 billion of
dividends on common shares and more than $0.1 billion of common share repurchases.
• Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum
levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase
program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43% were still available for repurchase at
September 30, 2024. Fourth quarter 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly
average share repurchase levels. PNC may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic
conditions, as well as other factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the
regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
• On October 3, 2024, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.60 per share to
be paid on November 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business October 16, 2024.
• Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% at September 30, 2024 from 9.9% at December 31, 2023.
• PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full
impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first
quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being
phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of
CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision. The estimated CET1 fully implemented ratio was 10.3%
at September 30, 2024 compared to 9.8% at December 31, 2023.
PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding an
SCB established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. For additional
information on our liquidity and capital actions as well as our capital ratios, see Capital Management in the Risk Management section
in this Financial Review, the Recent Regulatory Developments section in this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation
section in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Business Outlook
Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies.
These statements are based on our views that:
• Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term, but PNC’s baseline forecast is for
slower economic growth at the end of 2024 and in the first half of 2025 as high interest rates remain a drag on the economy.
• Real GDP growth this year will trend close to 2%, and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4% through the
rest of 2024 and in 2025. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, gradually moving back to the Federal
Reserve’s 2% long-term objective.
• With slowing inflation PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the FOMC’s remaining
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5 
meetings in 2024, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.25% and 4.50%. PNC expects several federal funds rate
cuts in 2025 as inflation continues to ease.
Consistent with the forward guidance we provided on October 15, 2024, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter
of 2024, we expect:
• Average loans to be stable,
• Net interest income to be up approximately 1%,
• Fee income to be down 5% to 7%,
• Other noninterest income to be $150 million to $200 million,
• Total revenue to be stable,
• Noninterest expense to be up 2% to 3%,
• Net loan charge-offs to be approximately $300 million.
Other noninterest income and total revenue guidance does not forecast net securities gains or losses and other Visa activity.
We are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures, without unreasonable
effort, to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and
amounts necessary for the reconciliation, when such amounts are subject to events that cannot be reasonably predicted, as noted in our
Cautionary Statement. Accordingly, we cannot address the probable significance of unavailable information.
See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors
included in our 2023 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in
these forward-looking statements.

CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW
Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 1 of this Report.
Net income of $1.5 billion, or $3.49 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024 increased $28 million, or 2%, compared
to $1.5 billion, or $3.39 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher net interest income and
strong capital markets and advisory revenue, partially offset by lower other noninterest income. Net income of $4.3 billion, or $9.98
per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2024 decreased $438 million, or 9%, compared to $4.8 billion, or $10.94 per
diluted common share, for the same period in 2023 driven by lower net interest income and a higher provision for credit losses,
partially offset by higher noninterest income.

(a) Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as
well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income
earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated
Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in
Item 1 of this Report.
Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and
related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7 
Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional
information.
Net interest income increased $108 million, or 3%, and net interest margin increased 4 basis points compared to the second quarter of
2024 driven by higher yields on interest-earning assets. In the year-to-date comparison, net interest income decreased $537 million, or
5%, and net interest margin decreased 18 basis points, as the benefit of higher interest-earning asset yields was more than offset by
increased funding costs.
Average investment securities increased $1.0 billion, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily driven by net purchase
activity of U.S. Treasury securities. Average investment securities decreased $1.7 billion, or 1%, in the year-to-date comparison as net
purchase activity was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities. Average investment securities represented 28% of
average interest-earning assets for the third and second quarters of 2024, and 27% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 28%
for the first nine months of 2023.
Average loans were stable for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. Compared to the first nine months of
2023, average loans decreased $3.1 billion, primarily due to lower average utilization of commercial loan commitments. Average
loans represented 62% of average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 63% for the second quarter of 2024,
and 62% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 64% for the first nine months of 2023.
Average interest-earning deposits with banks for the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.2 billion, or 10%, compared to the second
quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting deposit growth. In the year-to-date comparison, average interest-earning deposits with banks
increased $10.3 billion, or 30%, due to higher borrowed funds and lower loan and securities balances, partially offset by lower
deposits.
Average interest-bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased $5.4 billion, or 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2024
and $8.8 billion, or 3%, in the year-to-date comparison. The increase in both comparisons reflected growth in commercial deposits,
partially offset by a decline in consumer balances. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 81% of average interestbearing liabilities for both the third and second quarters of 2024, and 81% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 83%, for the
first nine months of 2023.
Average borrowed funds decreased $1.4 billion, or 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2024, reflecting lower FHLB borrowings,
partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, average borrowed funds
increased $11.0 billion, or 17%, primarily due to parent company senior debt issuances.
Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.

Asset management and brokerage fees increased compared to the second quarter of 2024, reflecting higher average equity markets.
The increase in the year-to-date comparison reflected the impact of higher average equity markets as well as higher annuity sales.
PNC’s discretionary client assets under management of $214 billion at September 30, 2024 increased from $196 billion and $176
billion at June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. In both comparisons, the increase was primarily due to higher spot
equity and fixed income markets.
Capital markets and advisory fees increased compared to the second quarter of 2024, and included higher merger and acquisition
advisory activity, increased asset backed financing revenue and higher underwriting fees. The increase in the year-to-date comparison
was primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity and increased underwriting fees.
Card and cash management revenue decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 reflecting the impact of credit card origination
incentives, partially offset by higher treasury management product revenue. The increase compared to the first nine months of 2023
was primarily due to higher treasury management product revenue.
Lending and deposit services grew in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons primarily due to increased customer activity.
Residential and commercial mortgage increased compared to the second quarter of 2024 driven by higher residential mortgage
servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The decrease compared to the first nine months of 2023 was driven by lower
residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.
Other noninterest income decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 reflecting Visa derivative fair value adjustments of
negative $128 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily related to litigation escrow funding, while the second quarter of 2024
included the benefit of $141 million of significant items. Compared to the first nine months of 2023, the increase was driven by the
benefit of significant items in the second quarter of 2024.

Noninterest expense decreased compared to the second quarter of 2024 as increased personnel costs, reflecting higher variable
compensation related to increased business activity, were more than offset by a PNC Foundation contribution expense of $120 million
in the second quarter of 2024. Noninterest expense increased compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to a $130 million pre-tax
expense in the first quarter of 2024 related to the increase in the FDIC’s expected losses following the closures of Silicon Bank and
Signature Bank, as well as the second quarter PNC Foundation contribution expense.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The effective income tax rate was 19.2% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 18.8% for the second quarter of 2024, and 18.9% in

credit losses of $633 million for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity partially offset by an improved
macroeconomic outlook.

Our balance sheet was well positioned at September 30, 2024. In comparison to December 31, 2023:
• Total assets were stable reflecting higher securities balances, partially offset by lower balances held with the Federal Reserve
Bank.
• Total liabilities were stable.
• Total equity increased due to the benefit of net income and an improvement in AOCI, partially offset by dividends paid and
common shares repurchased.
The ACL related to loans totaled $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The
decrease in the comparison was driven by improved macroeconomic factors as well as portfolio activity. See the following for
additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:

Consumer loans decreased as growth in automobile loans was more than offset by declines in the remaining portfolios as paydowns
outpaced originations as well as lower utilization.
For additional information regarding our loan portfolio see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in
this Financial Review and Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.
Investment Securities
Investment securities of $144.2 billion at September 30, 2024 increased $11.6 billion, or 9%, compared to December 31, 2023 due to
increased net purchase activity, primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, partially offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities.
In the second quarter of 2024, we repositioned the investment securities portfolio and sold available for sale securities with a market
value of $3.8 billion and a weighted average yield of approximately 1.5%. The sale of these securities resulted in a loss of
$497 million. We deployed the sale proceeds into available-for-sale securities with a market value of $3.8 billion and a weighted
average yield of approximately 5.5%.
The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market
conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to
optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the LCR, NSFR and
other internal and external guidelines and constraints.

Table 9 presents our investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value. The relationship of fair value to amortized cost at
September 30, 2024 primarily reflected the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of fixed-rate securities. We continually
monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for investment securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected
credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected
prepayments. See Note 2 Investment Securities for additional details regarding the allowance for investment securities.
The duration of investment securities was 3.3 years and 4.2 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We
estimate that at September 30, 2024 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points
parallel increase in interest rates and 3.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts
at December 31, 2023 for the effective duration of investment securities were 4.1 years and 4.2 years, respectively.
Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 5.2 years
and 5.5 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Deposits are considered an attractive source of funding due to their stability and relatively low cost to fund. Compared to December
31, 2023, our funding source composition included lower borrowed funds and higher deposit balances.
Total deposits increased reflecting higher interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Interestbearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing
deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances. This shift in deposit composition contributed
to an increase in funding costs compared to the first and second quarters of 2024. Our total brokered deposit balances of $10.1 billion
at September 30, 2024 decreased compared to $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, and were significantly below both our internal and
regulatory guidelines and limits.
Borrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB borrowings, partially offset by parent company senior debt issuances.
The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, capital
considerations, and funding needs, which are primarily driven by changes in loan, deposit and investment securities balances. While
our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses, we also
manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and
NSFR requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of
the Risk Management section in this Financial Review for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital activities. See
Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report and Note 9 Borrowed Funds in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information related to our
borrowings. See Average Consolidated Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis in the Statistical Information section of this Report for
additional information on volume and related funding cost changes.
Shareholders’ Equity
Total shareholders’ equity of $55.7 billion at September 30, 2024 increased $4.6 billion compared to December 31, 2023, primarily
due to net income of $4.3 billion and an improvement in AOCI of $2.6 billion, partially offset by dividends paid of $2.2 billion and
$0.4 billion of common share repurchases.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW
We have three reportable business segments:
• Retail Banking
• Corporate & Institutional Banking
• Asset Management Group
Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in
Other, as shown in Table 79 in Note 14 Segment Reporting. Other includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for
disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses,
ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments,
intercompany eliminations, corporate overhead net of allocations, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited
businesses and the residual impact from FTP operations.
Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the
presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.
See Note 14 Segment Reporting for additional information on our business segments, including a description of each business.

Retail Banking earnings for the first nine months of 2024 increased $1.3 billion compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to
higher revenue and lower noninterest expense.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
declines in average deposit balances.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison reflecting a gain resulting from PNC’s participation in the Visa exchange program as
well as higher asset management and brokerage fees, partially offset by lower card and cash management fees.
Provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity, partially offset by an improved
macroeconomic outlook.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison and included lower personnel expense.
Retail Banking average total loans remained stable in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Average
consumer loans decreased driven by lower residential real estate, as a result of paydowns outpacing new volume, as well as continued
declines in education loans from runoff in the government guaranteed portfolio. Average commercial loans increased due to higher
loan commitment utilization, primarily within the automobile dealer segment.
Our focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail Banking, which is based on
attracting and retaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing,
focused on retaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more ratesensitive customers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In the first
nine months of 2024, average total deposits decreased compared to the same period in 2023, and included the impact of quantitative
tightening by the Federal Reserve and increased customer spending.
Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for
consumers and small businesses, including our recently launched new PNC Cash Unlimited®	credit card.
As part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate and continue to optimize a coast-tocoast network of retail branches and ATMs, which are complemented by PNC’s suite of digital capabilities. In February 2024, PNC
announced it would be investing nearly $1.0 billion, through 2028, to open more than 100 new branches in key locations, including
Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, and San Antonio, and to renovate more than 1,200 existing locations across the country to
enhance the customer experience.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings in the first nine months of 2024 increased $528 million compared to the same period in
2023 driven by higher revenue, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by
narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans and lower average loan balances.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison and included higher capital markets and advisory fees and growth in treasury
management product revenue.
Provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of portfolio activity, partially offset by an improved
macroeconomic outlook.
Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely due to higher variable costs associated with increased business activity and
continued investments to support growth.
Average total loans were stable compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023:
• Corporate Banking provides lending, equipment finance, treasury management and capital markets products and services to
mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business were stable as
lower average utilization of loan commitments was largely offset by the acquisition of capital commitment facilities from
Signature Bridge Bank in the fourth quarter of 2023.
• Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average
loans for this business declined largely due to paydowns outpacing new production, partially offset by a higher average
utilization of loan commitments.
• Business Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is mainly
secured by business assets. Average loans for this business declined reflecting a lower average utilization of loan
commitments.
• Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets products and services to smaller
corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business declined driven by paydowns outpacing new production and
lower average utilization of loan commitments.
The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining
relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to
provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits were stable compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as
growth in interest-bearing deposits offset a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate
environment and make adjustments to our deposit strategy in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client
relationship dynamics.
Product Revenue
In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including
treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers
of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income and
noninterest income, as appropriate. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is
reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results, and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses
where the customer relationships exist. The Other Information section in Table 13 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for
treasury management and commercial mortgage banking services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services
follows.
The Treasury Management business provides corporations with cash and investment management services, receivables and
disbursement management services, funds transfer services and access to online/mobile information management and reporting
services. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes
treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for
products and services. Net interest income includes funding credit from all treasury management customer deposit balances.
Compared to the first nine months of 2023, treasury management revenue increased due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of
deposits and higher product revenue.
Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and
18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
noninterest income), revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and hedges related to those activities. Total
revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison primarily due to higher commercial mortgage loan
servicing income and a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of hedge, partially offset by lower
revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale.
Capital markets and advisory includes services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory, equity capital
markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting and customer-related trading. The increase in
capital markets and advisory fees in the comparison was largely driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, underwriting
fees and loan syndication fees, partially offset by lower customer-related interest rate derivative trading revenue.

quality banking, trust and investment management services to our emerging affluent, high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients
through a broad array of products and services.
20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Institutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, cash and fixed income client solutions, and
retirement plan fiduciary investment services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies,
municipalities and non-profits.
Asset Management Group earnings in the first nine months of 2024 increased $116 million compared to the same period in 2023,
primarily driven by higher revenue and a decline in noninterest expense.
Net interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and an increase in
average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.
Noninterest income increased in the comparison primarily driven by higher average equity markets, partially offset by the impact of
client activity.
Noninterest expense decreased in the comparison, reflecting a continued focus on expense management.
Average total loans increased compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by growth in residential
mortgage loans.
Average total deposits were stable in the comparison as growth in CD and deposit sweep balances was partially offset by declines in
savings and noninterest bearing deposits.
Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher equity and fixed
income markets as of September 30, 2024.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework,
including risk culture, enterprise strategy, risk governance and oversight framework, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls
and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting. Additionally, our 2023 Form 10-K provides an analysis of the firm’s Capital
Management and our key areas of risk, which include, but are not limited to, Credit, Market, Liquidity and Operational (including
Compliance and Information Security).
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk, including our credit risk management processes, is described in further detail in the Credit Risk Management section of
our 2023 Form 10-K. The following provides additional information around our loan portfolio, which is our most significant
concentration of credit risk.

We use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses, to monitor and
measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan
classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.
Commercial
Commercial and Industrial
Commercial and industrial loans comprised 56% and 55% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of
repayment should a borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as
accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, owner-occupied real estate and other business
assets.
We actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk
at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of
the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity
in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to
monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies
that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following
table (based on the North American Industry Classification System).

Owner occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $9.4 billion and $9.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. These loans are included in commercial and industrial loans as the credit decisioning for servicing these loans is based on
the financial conditions of the owner, not the ability of the collateral to generate income. Owner occupied commercial real estate loans
are well-diversified across industries.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans of $35.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 comprised $19.6 billion related to commercial mortgages on
income-producing properties, $9.9 billion of intermediate-term financing loans and $5.6 billion of real estate construction project
loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $35.4 billion, $21.0 billion, $8.0 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.
Commercial real estate primarily consists of an investment in land and/or buildings held to generate income, that income serves as the
primary source for the repayment of the loan. However, for all commercial real estate assets, the disposition of the assigned collateral
serves as a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties.
We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD
and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with commercial real estate loans tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location
and quality, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The
portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.

Commercial Real Estate: Office Portfolio
Given the fundamental change in office demand driven by the acceptance of remote work, real estate performance related to the office
sector continues to be an area of uncertainty. At September 30, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the office portfolio totaled $7.2
billion, or 2.2% of total loans, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $0.3 billion. The portfolio is well diversified
geographically across our coast-to-coast franchise. Within the office portfolio at September 30, 2024, criticized loans totaled 28.9%
and nonperforming loans totaled 12.5%, while delinquencies were 0.1%. As measured at origination, the weighted average LTV for
the office portfolio was 58.6%; however, updated appraisals have increased the weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated
property values and origination-derived values to 70.9% as of September 30, 2024. While LTV is one consideration, our risk
assessment considers a number of factors in assessing the changing conditions affecting the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we
have established reserves of 11.3% against office loans.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 23 
The greatest stress in our office portfolio is observed in multi-tenant office loans, which represents 54.0% of the portfolio at
September 30, 2024. Within the multi-tenant classification, criticized levels were 50.2% while nonperforming loans totaled 22.4%,
accounting for almost all of the nonperforming office population. The weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated property
values and origination-derived values for multi-tenant is 79.6% at September 30, 2024. Additionally, commercial real estate chargeoffs since the beginning of 2023 have primarily been multi-tenant office loans. Given the higher level of stress, this segment has a
proportionally higher reserve rate of 16.0%. The remaining 46.0% of the office portfolio is primarily comprised of single-tenant,
medical and government tenant properties. These three tenant classifications are performing considerably better, with approximately
3.6% of the book in the criticized loan category and 0.6% in the nonperforming loan category. As of September 30, 2024, the
weighted average LTV inclusive of both updated property values and origination-derived values of this book is 60.2%.
The office portfolio remains an elevated area of focus for portfolio management, with internal risk ratings completed quarterly for
each asset, accelerated reappraisal requirements and elevated approval levels for any credit action. Additionally, active management
efforts include ongoing performance assessments as well as the review of property, lending and capital markets. Portfolio updates are
distributed to senior management weekly. Collateral in the office portfolio is appraised by qualified, independent third-party state
certified appraisers. New loans or loans being evaluated for extension or material modification are required to be appraised. The
frequency of reappraisals outside of a credit action is based on regulatory and internal requirements. Generally, for loans with
heightened risk, a cadence has been established to obtain updated appraisals at least annually. Loans that do not demonstrate a
heightened risk are monitored through our ongoing management of the portfolio, including any need for a new appraisal. All
appraisals are reviewed by independent qualified real estate valuation personnel. For existing office building loans, PNC employs the
as-is market value from third-party appraisals to calculate LTV.
Given the ongoing change in this area, we expect additional stress in the office sector, and a portion of this stress will bear itself out as
we work through maturities that will approximate 42% through September 30, 2025. Upon maturity, and where the balance is not paid
in full, an extension may be granted because contractual extension terms are met; alternatively, an extension may be granted based on
negotiated terms, and a portion of these extensions may involve the curtailment or charge off of principal. We continue to actively
manage the portfolio, and we believe reserve levels reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio.
Commercial Real Estate: Multifamily Portfolio
As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding loan balances in the multifamily portfolio totaled $16.7 billion, or 5.2% of total loans,
while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $2.7 billion. Although inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and elevated
supply in certain markets have impacted internal risk assessments and regulatory classification in this portfolio, we have not seen a
notable change in loan performance at this time with regards to nonperformance, delinquency or charge-offs. We continue to closely
monitor our exposure in this sector.
Consumer
Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
We obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these and other credit metrics at least
quarterly. We track borrower performance monthly. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g.,
nonconforming or conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk
analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and
bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations.

We originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network.
Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with
servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we
retain on our balance sheet. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $42.2 billion at
September 30, 2024, with 46% located in California. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023 were $42.4 billion and 45%,
respectively.
Home Equity
Home equity loans of $26.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 were comprised of $21.0 billion of home equity lines of credit and $5.0
billion of closed-end home equity installment loans. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $26.2 billion, $20.6 billion and
$5.6 billion, respectively. Home equity lines of credit are a variable interest rate product with fixed rate conversion options available
to certain borrowers.
Similar to residential real estate loans, we obtain loan attributes at origination, including FICO scores and LTVs, and we update these
and other credit metrics at least quarterly. Borrower performance of this portfolio is tracked on a monthly basis. We also segment the
population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, legacy brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit
or legacy brokered home equity lines of credit) and track the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of
whether we hold such liens. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis
and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy
status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.
The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of
the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at
the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use a third-party service provider to
obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.

Automobile
Auto loans of $15.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 comprised $14.1 billion in the indirect auto portfolio and $1.0 billion in the
direct auto portfolio. At December 31, 2023, comparable amounts were $14.9 billion, $13.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The
indirect auto portfolio consists of loans originated primarily through independent franchised dealers, including dealers located in our
newer markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.
The following table presents certain key statistics related to our indirect and direct auto portfolios:

We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores
noted in Table 20. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At September 30, 2024, the
portfolio balance was composed of 43% new vehicle loans and 57% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2023
were 45% and 55%, respectively.
The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including both updated collateral values and FICO scores that are
obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type
and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the
portfolio by geography, channel, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans
accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent full collection of contractual principal and interest is
not probable. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option
are excluded from nonperforming loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K for details on our nonaccrual
policies.
The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets by major category:

As of September 30, 2024, approximately 97% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral.
Loan Delinquencies
We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels are a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio.
Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due are
considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans, loans accounted for under the fair value
option and PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral, and other support given
current events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to address operating environment changes such as
inflation levels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and
secular changes such as those arising from the pandemic. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support, we offer loan
modifications and collection programs to assist our customers.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the
process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines,
or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.
Loan Modifications
We provide relief to our customers experiencing financial hardships through a variety of solutions. Commercial loan and lease
modifications are based on each individual borrower’s situation, while consumer loan modifications are evaluated under our hardship
relief programs. For additional information on our commercial real estate, office-related modification offerings, see the Commercial
Real Estate portion of the Credit Risk Management section of this Financial Review.
See Note 3 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on loan modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, the reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction
characteristics and assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date. We maintain the ACL at an
appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and
unfunded lending related commitments.
See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the Credit Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion of our
ACL, including details of our methodologies. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section of this Report for
further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of September 30, 2024.

increase in the comparison was driven by higher net charge-offs in our commercial portfolio, primarily in our commercial real estate
loan class.

Liquidity and Capital Management
Our liquidity risk framework and related monitoring measures and tools, including internal liquidity stress testing as well as
compliance with internal and regulatory limits and guidelines, are described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management
section of our 2023 Form 10-K.
One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure
that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical
30-day stress scenario. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
LCR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the third quarter of 2024. Fluctuations in
our LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net cash outflows, as a
result of ongoing business activity.
The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%. The
NSFR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the third quarter of 2024.
30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and
Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.
Sources of Liquidity
Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These
deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $424.0 billion at September 30, 2024 from $421.4
billion at December 31, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits increased reflecting higher commercial balances, partially offset by lower
consumer balances. Noninterest-bearing deposit balances decreased due to a decline in both commercial and consumer balances. As of
September 30, 2024, uninsured deposits represented approximately 44% of our total deposit base, which is estimated based on the
regulatory instructions in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income - FFIEC 031. The majority of our uninsured deposits are
related to commercial operating and relationship accounts, which we define as commercial deposit customers who utilize two or more
PNC products. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review and Business Segments Review sections of
this Financial Review for additional information on our deposits and related strategies.
We may also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, such as senior notes, subordinated debt, FHLB borrowings, securities
sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. See the Funding Sources section of the
Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review and Note 7 Borrowed Funds in this Report for additional information
related to our borrowings.
Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:
Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt
In billions 2024
January 1 $ 31.7
Issuances 6.7
Calls and maturities (2.4)
Other 0.7
September 30 $ 36.7
Additionally, PNC maintains access to contingent funding sources that include unused borrowing capacity and certain liquid assets.
PNC has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and
commitments, particularly in the event of liquidity stress. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization’s liquidity
under various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan’s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides
the strategies for addressing liquidity needs and responsive actions we would consider during liquidity stress events, which could
include the issuance of incremental debt, preferred stock, or additional deposit actions, including the issuance of brokered CDs. The
plan also addresses the governance, frequency of reporting and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of liquidity stress.
PNC defines our primary contingent liquidity sources as cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities and unused
borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. The following table summarizes our primary contingent liquidity sources
at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Total available contingent liquidity $ 229.6 $ 224.4
(a) Represents the fair value of investment securities that can be used for pledging or to secure other sources of funding.
(b) At September 30, 2024, total FHLB borrowing capacity was $73.6 billion and total FHLB borrowings and letters of credit were $28.2 billion. Comparable amounts at
December 31, 2023 were $73.4 billion and $38.0 billion, respectively.
(c) Total borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank was $79.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and $47.2 billion at December 31, 2023. PNC had no outstanding
borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
As part of PNC’s contingency planning, we preposition a portion of our available held to maturity investment securities at the Federal
Reserve Bank’s Discount Window, supporting our resilience and operational readiness.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31 
Bank Liquidity
In addition to our primary contingent liquidity sources, under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from
time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated
notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes)
from their date of issue. At September 30, 2024, PNC Bank’s remaining capacity to issue under the program was $33.3 billion.
Under PNC Bank’s 2013 commercial paper program, PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to
provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2024, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
Additionally, PNC Bank may also access funding from the parent company through deposits placed at the bank or issuing
intercompany senior unsecured notes.
See Note 16 Subsequent Events for additional information on the October 22, 2024 announcement of the November 4, 2024
redemption of all outstanding $0.2 billion senior floating rate bank notes due on December 2, 2024.
Parent Company Liquidity
In addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we manage the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual
obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the
parent company maintains liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases
and acquisitions.
At September 30, 2024, available parent company liquidity totaled $26.4 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany
cash and investments. For investments with longer durations, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the
maturity of parent company debt obligations.
The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends or other capital distributions it receives from PNC Bank, which may
be impacted by the following:
• Bank-level capital needs,
• Laws, regulations and the results of supervisory activities,
• Corporate policies,
• Contractual restrictions, and
• Other factors.
There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to
extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the
parent company without prior regulatory approval was $6.8 billion at September 30, 2024. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our
2023 Form 10-K for further discussion of these limitations.
In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends
and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for
the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital
instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Under the parent company’s 2014 commercial paper program, the
parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2024,
there were no issuances outstanding under this program.
The following table details parent company note issuances in the third quarter of 2024:
Table 28: Parent Company Notes Issued

• October 28, 2024 redemption of all outstanding $1.0 billion of senior fixed-to-floating rate notes due on October 28, 2025.
Parent company senior and subordinated debt carrying value totaled $29.4 billion and $24.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and
postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section
of our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we have
various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on
our commitments in Note 8 Commitments.
Credit Ratings
PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative
instruments and the ability to offer certain products.
In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset
quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied
government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the
cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on the potential impacts from a
downgrade to our credit ratings, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K.

Capital Management
Detailed information on our capital management processes and activities is included in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item
1 of our 2023 Form 10-K.
We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming
debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and
managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.
In the third quarter of 2024, PNC returned $0.8 billion of capital to shareholders, including more than $0.6 billion of dividends on
common shares and more than $0.1 billion of common share repurchases. Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for
capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under
the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43% were still available for
repurchase at September 30, 2024. Fourth quarter 2024 share repurchase activity is expected to approximate recent quarterly average
share repurchase levels. PNC may adjust share repurchase activity depending on market and economic conditions, as well as other
factors. PNC’s SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2024 is the regulatory minimum of 2.5%.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33 
On October 3, 2024 the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.60 per share to be paid on
November 5, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business October 16, 2024.

(a) The ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provisions. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year
transition period and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.
(b) The ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of the optional five-year transition.
(c) As permitted, PNC and PNC Bank have elected to exclude AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital.
(d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.
(e) The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account the quarterly average of both
on balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.
(f) All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.
(g) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.
PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under
the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.
Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, FDMs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject
to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.
The regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting certain banks, including PNC, to delay the estimated impact on regulatory
capital stemming from implementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in
retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the allowance for
PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition
period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See additional
discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K.
34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
At September 30, 2024, PNC and PNC Bank were considered “well capitalized” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio
requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and
10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 riskbased capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.
Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital
well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient
to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage
our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and we believe that our September 30, 2024 capital levels were aligned with
them.
We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts, including the
proposed rules to adjust the Basel III framework, in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors
and Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Market Risk Management
See the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding
market risk.
Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors,
including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the
interest that we earn on assets, the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to
the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only
affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.
Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk
management policies, which are approved by management’s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.
PNC utilizes sensitivities of NII and EVE to a set of interest rate scenarios to identify and measure its short-term and long-term
structural interest rate risks.
NII Sensitivity results for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow:
Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis
Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023
Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a)
Effect on NII in first year from shocked interest rate:
200 basis point instantaneous increase (0.5) % (0.3) %
200 basis point instantaneous decrease (0.6) % —
(a) The effect on NII in the first year from a 100 basis point instantaneous increase or decrease is not materially different from the 200 basis point scenarios as disclosed above.
When forecasting NII, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including the following:
Future Balance Sheet Composition: Our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations. As of the
third quarter of 2024, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot composition
as of the third quarter of 2024.
Deposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate. PNC’s deposit beta was 32% for
September 2024. We define deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits divided by the change in
the upper level of the average stated Federal Funds rate range since August 2024, the start of the current easing rate cycle. For rate
sensitivity purposes, PNC assumes the cumulative deposit beta will increase from the current level. Prior to the beginning of the easing
cycle, PNC’s beta calculation represented the change in deposit rate paid on interest-bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the
change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate since the first quarter of 2022, the start of the rising rate cycle. For interest
rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity depending on market rate levels as well as
other factors. The dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience and future expectations. Actual deposit rates paid may differ
from modeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer behavior.
Asset Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios. Mortgage and home equity
portfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments. Commercial and
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35 
other consumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios
historically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates.
Impact of Derivatives: PNC uses interest rate derivatives, some of which are forward starting, to hedge floating rate commercial loans.
PNC had $48.8 billion in receive fix/pay float swaps as of September 30, 2024, with a weighted average duration of 2.45 years and an
average fixed rate of 3.44%. As of September 30, 2024, PNC also had collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5
billion of floors, that are used to hedge these commercial loans. Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix/pay float swaps as a means of
hedging fixed rate debt, as well as pay fix/receive float swaps as a means of hedging the investment securities portfolio. See Note 12
Financial Derivatives in this Report for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans, investment
securities and fixed rate debt.
EVE sensitivity results for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 follow:
Table 32: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Analysis
Third Quarter 2024 Third Quarter 2023
Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Simulation
200 basis point instantaneous increase (4.2) % (7.0) %
200 basis point instantaneous decrease (4.1) % 0.8 %
EVE measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include
projected new volume. EVE sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to NII sensitivity analysis and represents an
estimation of long-term interest rate risk. PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates. Similar to
the NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions. These methodologies are
largely consistent between the EVE and NII sensitivity analyses. Additionally, deposit attrition is a significant contributor to EVE
sensitivity. Deposit attrition is projected based on a dynamic model developed using long-term historical deposit behavior in addition
to management assumptions including accelerated attrition for pandemic related excess deposits. PNC performs various sensitivity
analyses to understand the impact of faster and slower deposit attrition on our risk metrics, with the results reported to ALCO.
Compared to the third quarter of 2023, there have been no material changes to our NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity assumptions,
including data sources that drive assumptions setting.
Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk
We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging
activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are
marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.
We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate
the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. VaR is calculated for each of the
portfolios that comprise our customer-related trading activities of which the majority are covered positions as defined by the Market
Risk Rule. VaR is computed with positions and market risk factors updated daily to ensure each portfolio is operating within its
acceptable limits. See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2023 Form 10-K for more
information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.
Customer-related trading revenue was $75 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $118 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower derivative client sales revenue.
Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk
Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to
extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in
a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also
have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity, consistent with regulatory
limitations. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.
Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment
decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.

Tax Credit Investments
Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax
credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Note 4 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2023 Form 10-K has further information on tax credit
investments.
Private Equity and Other
The largest component of our other equity investments is our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid
portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity
investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. As of September 30, 2024, $2.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies, and $0.2 billion was invested
indirectly through various private equity funds.
During the second quarter of 2024, PNC participated in the Visa exchange program, allowing PNC to convert its Visa Class B-1
common shares into approximately equal amounts of Visa Class B-2 common shares and Visa Class C common shares. This
conversion event resulted in a gain of $754 million related to the Visa Class C common shares received. PNC retained the Visa Class
B-2 common shares. The Visa Class B-2 common shares, which are included in our other equity investments at cost, remain subject to
the same restrictions that were imposed on the Visa Class B-1 common shares. Participation in the exchange required PNC to agree to
a make-whole agreement that subjects PNC to the same indemnity obligations to Visa as prior to participation in the exchange
program.
The Visa Class B-2 common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until the resolution of the pending
interchange litigation or Visa launches another exchange program allowing PNC to convert a portion of its Visa Class B-2 common
shares into freely transferable Visa Class C common shares. At September 30, 2024, the estimated value of our total investment in the
Visa Class B-2 common shares was approximately $0.7 billion, while our cost basis was insignificant. The estimated value does not
represent fair value of the Visa Class B-2 common shares given the shares’ limited transferability and the lack of observable
transactions in the marketplace. See Note 14 Fair Value and Note 20 Legal Proceedings in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional
information regarding our Visa agreements.
We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with
both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were $31 million and $17 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
Financial Derivatives
Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually
require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a
notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less
than the notional amount on these instruments.
We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to
market risk (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to
facilitate their risk management activities.
Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 14 Fair Value and Note 15 Financial
Derivatives in our 2023 Form 10-K and in Note 11 Fair Value and Note 12 Financial Derivatives in this Report.
Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be
ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.

RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
Resolution Planning
In August 2024, the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized new guidance for holding company resolution plans submitted by triennial
full filers, such as PNC, under section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations. The guidance generally
applies expectations from the 2019 resolution plan guidance applicable to U.S. GSIBs. Firms like PNC with a multiple point of entry
resolution strategy will be required to incorporate more severe plan assumptions and include new required plan content, operational
capabilities and legal entity rationalization, among other requirements. PNC’s next 165(d) resolution plan is due October 1, 2025, per
an extension provided by the Federal Reserve and FDIC in finalizing the new guidance.
Other Regulatory Developments
On October 22, 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring certain entities, including
PNC Bank, to, upon request, make available to a consumer or third party authorized by the consumer certain information the entity has
concerning a consumer financial product or service covered by the rule. In issuing the rule, the CFPB said that the rule will move the
U.S. closer to an “open banking” system and will let consumers more easily switch banks or other providers. In general, the final rule
requires covered data providers, such as PNC Bank, to establish a developer interface satisfying specific security and other standards,
accept data sharing requests by third parties authorized by the consumer through that developer interface and, in response to such a
request, make that data available in electronic form to consumers and authorized third parties, including data aggregators. PNC Bank
will be prohibited from charging fees for maintaining the developer interface or providing access to such data. PNC and PNC Bank
may also act as authorized third parties receiving data under the rule from institutions, and the rule places data security, authorization,
and other obligations on those third parties, including limitations on secondary uses of the data received. PNC Bank must comply with
the rule beginning on April 1, 2026, and we are still assessing the impact of this rule.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2023
Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or
economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our
reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. The policies and judgments related to residential and
commercial MSRs and Level 3 fair value measurements are described in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2023
Form 10-K. The following details the critical estimates and judgments around the ACL.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our
existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for
the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated
recoveries. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and
transaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of
future economic conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these
factors and to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and
other methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis. We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best
estimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions. The major
drivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:
• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date. As
current economic conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.
• Scenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape, direction and rate of change of macroeconomic
forecasts and thus vary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Changes to the probability weights assigned to
these scenarios and the timing of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.
• Current borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on current borrower and transaction characteristics,
including credit metrics and collateral type/quality. As borrower quality evolves, forecasted losses could be materially
affected.
• Portfolio composition: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves
would be recognized upon origination or acquisition and derecognized upon paydown, maturity or sale.
For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of
one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves and
(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1
Accounting Policies in our 2023 Form 10-K.
38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q
Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast
Pursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses.
For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios
with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. Credit losses estimated in
our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to
them.
To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic
forecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forwardlooking expert judgment. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) to represent our current expectation within
that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution
and the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected
economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets. Each
quarter, the scenarios and their respective weights are presented to RAC for approval.
The scenarios used for the period ended September 30, 2024 consider, among other factors, ongoing inflationary pressures and the
corresponding tightness of monetary policy and credit availability. Given these factors, growth is expected to slow from current levels
in the coming quarters. While recession risks remain elevated, our most-likely expectation at September 30, 2024 is that the U.S.
economy avoids a recession.
We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.
unemployment rate. The following table presents a comparison of these two economic variables based on the weighted-average
scenario forecasts used in determining our ACL at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Table 34: Key Macroeconomic Variables in CECL Weighted-Average Scenarios
Assumptions as of September 30, 2024
2024 2025 2026
U.S. real GDP (a) 1.8% 0.8% 2.2%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.4% 5.1% 4.7%
Assumptions as of December 31, 2023
2024 2025 2026
U.S. real GDP (a) 0.1% 1.5% 2.0%
U.S. unemployment rate (b) 4.5% 4.6% 4.2%
(a) Represents year-over-year growth rates.
(b) Represents quarterly average rate at December 31, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.
Real GDP growth is expected to end 2024 at 1.8% on a weighted average basis, up from the 0.1% assumed at December 31, 2023,
primarily due to stronger economic activity in 2024 than what was expected at the end of 2023. Growth then slows to 0.8% in 2025,
before increasing to 2.2% in 2026. The weighted-average unemployment rate is expected to end 2024 at 4.4% down slightly from the
4.5% level assumed at December 31, 2023. The weighted-average unemployment rate is then expected to increase moderately through
2025 before decreasing to 4.7% by the fourth quarter of 2026.
The current state of the economy continues to reflect uncertainty due to the fundamental change in office demand from the acceptance
of remote work, combined with inflationary pressures, interest rate movements and housing affordability. As such, for both our
commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analyses around segments impacted by such
uncertainties to ensure our reserves are appropriate, given our current macroeconomic expectations.
We believe the economic scenarios effectively reflect the distribution of potential economic outcomes. Additionally, through in-depth
and granular analysis we have addressed reserve requirements for the specific populations most affected in the current environment.
Through this approach, we believe the reserve levels appropriately reflect the expected credit losses in the portfolio as of the balance
sheet date.

– Impacts of sanctions, tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,
– Impacts of changes in federal, state and local governmental policy, including on the regulatory landscape, capital
markets, taxes, infrastructure spending and social programs,
– Our ability to attract, recruit and retain skilled employees, and
– Commodity price volatility.
• Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be
substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our views that:
– Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth in the near term, but PNC’s baseline
forecast is for slower economic growth at the end of 2024 and in the first half of 2025 as high interest rates remain a
drag on the economy.
– Real GDP growth this year will trend close to 2%, and the unemployment rate will remain somewhat above 4%
through the rest of 2024 and in 2025. Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures abate, gradually moving back
to the Federal Reserve’s 2% long-term objective.
– With slowing inflation PNC expects two additional federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the FOMC’s
remaining meetings in 2024, with the rate ending this year in a range between 4.25% and 4.50%. PNC expects
several federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as inflation continues to ease.
• PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or
exceeding minimum capital levels, including a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection
with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process.
• PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, PNC’s financial performance, the scope and
terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In
addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital
distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and
regulatory review of related models and the reliability of and risks resulting from extensive use of such models.
• Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results
of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could
affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain employees. These
developments could include:
– Changes to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, changes in
the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations and changes in accounting and reporting standards.
The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 41 
– Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or
other inquiries resulting in monetary losses, costs, or alterations in our business practices and potentially causing
reputational harm to PNC.
– Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of
agreements with governmental agencies.
– Costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual
property protection in general.
• Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses,
including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital
management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.
• Our reputation and business and operating results may be affected by our ability to appropriately meet or address
environmental, social or governance targets, goals, commitments or concerns that may arise.
• We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those
presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our
entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as
well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, the integration of the
acquired businesses into PNC after closing or any failure to execute strategic or operational plans.
• Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing,
which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also
impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.
• Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread manmade, natural and other disasters (including severe
weather events), health emergencies, dislocations, geopolitical instabilities or events, terrorist activities, system failures or
disruptions, security breaches, cyberattacks, international hostilities, or other extraordinary events beyond PNC’s control
through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties, customers or third-party
vendors and service providers specifically.
We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs and elsewhere
in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the
Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and
uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.
