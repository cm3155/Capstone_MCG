 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&#38;A) 

Business Introduction 

We are a globally integrated payments company that provides our customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are credit and charge card products, along with travel and lifestyle related services, offered to consumers and businesses around the world. Our range of products and services includes: 

&#8226; Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products 

&#8226; Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information products and services for merchants 

&#8226; Network services 

&#8226; Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs 

&#8226; Expense management products and services 

&#8226; Travel and lifestyle services 

Our various products and services are offered globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are offered through various channels, including mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. 

We compete in the global payments industry with card networks, issuers and acquirers, paper-based transactions (e.g., cash and checks), bank transfer models (e.g., wire transfers and Automated Clearing House (ACH)), as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we face increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies, business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions. 

Effective for the first quarter of 2022, we made the following reporting presentation changes to our Consolidated Statements of Income: 

Within Non-interest revenues: 

&#8226; Processed revenue represents revenues earned from processed volumes, previously reported in Discount revenue, Other fees and commissions and Other revenue. 

&#8226; Service fees and other revenue combines the remaining balances from Other fees and commissions and Other revenue. 

Within Total expenses: 

&#8226; Disaggregated Marketing and business development expense into Business development expense and Marketing expense. 

Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation; there was no impact to Total non-interest revenues or Total expenses. 

Effective for the third quarter of 2022, we realigned our reportable segments to reflect organizational changes announced during the second quarter of 2022. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the new reportable operating segments, which are: U.S. Consumer Services (USCS), Commercial Services (CS), International Card Services (ICS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS), with corporate functions and certain other businesses and operations included in Corporate &#38; Other. Refer to Note 1 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for additional information.

(a) Represents net income, less (i) earnings allocated to participating share awards of $14 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and $45 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, (ii) dividends on preferred shares of $14 million and $20 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $43 million and $49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and (iii) an equity-related adjustment of $9 million related to the redemption of preferred shares for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. 

(b) Our common stock trades principally on The New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol AXP. 

(c) Return on average equity (ROE) is calculated by dividing (i) annualized net income for the period by (ii) average shareholders&#8217; equity for the period. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, the interim period calculation methodology for ROE was modified to present the returns for the period on an annualized basis rather than the preceding twelve months. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation. 

(d) Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to Table 8 for a reconciliation to Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans. 

Business Environment 

Our results for the third quarter reflect strong performance and continued strength in our premium Card Member base, despite uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. We continue to invest in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage, which is driving growth across our businesses. 

Our network volumes for the third quarter increased 19 percent year-over-year (23 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ) and billed business, which accounts for the majority of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 21 percent year-over-year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ). The increase in billed business across our segments was driven by sustained growth in Goods &#38; Services spending and the continued momentum in T&#38;E spending, including T&#38;E spending in our international markets exceeding pre-pandemic levels on an FX-adjusted basis 1 . U.S. Consumer billed business grew by 22 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business in our Commercial Services segment grew by 20 percent on a year-over-year basis reflecting continued strength in spending by our U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise customers, as well as continued recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 21 percent year-over-year (37 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ), driven by increased spending by both consumer and commercial customers. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our international billings. 

Total revenues net of interest expense increased 24 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis 1 ) reflecting strong growth in all our revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 23 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. Service fees and other revenue increased 39 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net card fees grew 17 percent year-over-year, as new card acquisitions increased and Card Member retention remained high due to the investments we have been making in our premium value propositions. Net interest income grew by 29 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in loans, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher rates. 

Card Member loans grew 29 percent year-over-year, driven by ongoing strong growth in billed business. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarter-over-quarter. Provisions for credit losses increased, primarily driven by reserve builds in the current period, as compared to reserve releases in the prior period, and higher net write-offs. The reserve builds in the current period reflected the strong growth in loans and changes in the macroeconomic outlook. Write-off and delinquency rates remained low in the current quarter; however, delinquency rates modestly increased on a sequential basis. 

Card Member rewards, Business development and Card Member services are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage and increased year-over-year primarily due to network volume growth and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. 

Operating expenses increased 22 percent year-over-year primarily due to higher compensation costs in the current quarter and net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current period as compared to net gains in the prior period, partially offset by the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our international expenses. During the quarter, we maintained our capital ratios within our target range and returned $1.0 billion of capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. 

Our strong performance continues to give us confidence in our business model, although we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. We remain committed to executing on our strategy for building sustainable long-term growth. 

See &#8220;Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for information on certain matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non-GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency 

adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 

Results of Operations 

The discussions in both the &#8220;Consolidated Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Business Segment Results of Operations&#8221; provide commentary on the variances for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in the prior year, as presented in the accompanying tables.

Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense 

Discount revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in billed business of 21 percent and 27 percent, respectively. See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 

Service fees and other revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher travel related revenues from foreign exchange-related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending and higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business. The increase for the nine month period also reflected income from equity method investments in the current period, which included a portion of the revenue allocated to a joint venture partner as described in Business development expense below, versus a net loss in the prior period. 

Processed revenue increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in processed volumes, partially offset by the repositioning of certain of our alternative payment solutions. 

Interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily reflecting higher average Card Member loan balances and higher interest rates. 

Interest expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates.

Provisions for Credit Losses 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to reserve builds in the current periods, versus reserve releases in the prior periods, and higher net write-offs. The reserve builds in the current periods were primarily driven by increases in loans outstanding and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset, for the current nine month period, by a reduction in COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves. The reserve releases in the prior periods were driven by lower delinquencies and improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to reserve builds in the current periods, versus reserve releases in the prior periods, and higher net write-offs. The reserve build in the current three month period was primarily driven by higher delinquencies. The reserve build in the current nine month period was primarily driven by an increase in receivables outstanding and higher delinquencies. The reserve releases in the prior periods were driven by lower delinquencies and improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in receivables outstanding. 

Other loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase for the three month period was primarily due to a reserve build in the current period, driven by higher non-card balances, versus a reserve release in the prior period, and higher net write-offs. The increase for the nine month period was primarily due to a lower reserve release in the current period, partially offset by lower net write-offs. The reserve releases in the prior periods were due to improved credit performance and lower non-card loans outstanding. 

Refer to Note 3 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information regarding our reserves for credit losses.

Expenses 

Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses, collectively, of $319 million and $1.5 billion, and cobrand rewards expense of $232 million and $824 million for the three and nine month periods, respectively, all of which were primarily driven by higher billed business. The increases in Membership Rewards expense were also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel, partially offset by a lower mix of redemptions in travel-related categories, as compared to the prior periods. 

The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at September 30, 2022 and 96 percent at September 30, 2021. 

Business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes and, for the nine month period, a charge related to revenue allocated to a joint venture partner for certain categories of transactions. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increases in business investments to continue building growth momentum. 

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher compensation expenses driven by increased headcount and compensation decisions. 

Other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current periods, as compared to net gains in the prior periods, higher technology costs and increases in professional services expenses in the current periods. 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate was 23.6 percent and 25.5 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 23.0 percent and 24.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three month period primarily reflected changes in the geographic mix of pretax income. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine month period primarily reflected discrete tax benefits in the current period related to the resolution of certain prior years&#8217; tax items and stock-based compensation.

(c) Adjusted net interest income and net interest yield on average Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to &#8220;Glossary of Selected Terminology&#8221; for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income is useful to investors because it represents the interest expense and interest income attributable to our Card Member loan portfolio and is a component of net interest yield on average Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio. Net interest yield on average Card Member loans reflects adjusted net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Net interest income divided by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis, a GAAP measure, includes elements of total interest income and total interest expense that are not attributable to the Card Member loan portfolio, and thus is not representative of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.

USCS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer cards and provides services to U.S. consumers, including travel and lifestyle services as well as banking and non-card financing products. 

Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods across all revenue categories. 

Discount revenue increased 23 percent and 29 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by increases in U.S. consumer billed business. 

See Tables 5, 6 and 10 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees increased 27 percent and 23 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 

Service fees and other revenue increased 56 percent and 55 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business. 

Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by an increase in average Card Member loan balances. 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase for the three month period was primarily due to a reserve build in the current period, versus a reserve release in the prior period, and higher net write-offs. The increase for the nine month period was primarily due to a lower reserve release in the current period and higher net write-offs. The reserve build in the current three month period was driven by an increase in loans outstanding and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The reserve release in the current nine month period was primarily driven by reduction in COVID-19 pandemic-driven reserves, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The reserve releases in the prior periods were driven by lower delinquencies and improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by increases in loans outstanding. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to reserve builds in the current periods, versus reserve releases in the prior periods, and higher net write-offs. The reserve builds in the current periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies. The reserve build in the current three month period was partially offset by a decrease in receivables outstanding. The reserve releases in the prior periods were driven by lower delinquencies and improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by increases in receivables outstanding. 

Total expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods across all expense categories. 

Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher billed business as well as higher travel-related redemptions. 

Business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increased partner payments driven by higher billed business. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by increases in business investments. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher technology, servicing and compensation costs.

In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. Corporate receivables delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing and the net write-off rate based on principal losses only are not available due to system constraints.

ICS issues a wide range of proprietary consumer, small business and corporate cards outside the United States. ICS also provides services to our international customers, including travel and lifestyle services, and manages certain international joint ventures and our loyalty coalition businesses. 

Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher Discount revenue. 

Discount revenue increased 23 percent and 31 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, and increased 39 percent and 43 percent for the same respective periods on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily reflecting increases in billed business. 1 

See Tables 5, 6 and 14 for more details on billed business performance. 

Net card fees remained flat and increased 2 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, and increased 15 percent and 12 percent for the same respective periods on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily driven by growth in our premium card portfolios. 1 

Service fees and other revenue increased 34 percent and 46 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, and increased 51 percent and 60 percent for the same respective periods on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily due to higher foreign exchange-related revenues associated with Card Member cross-currency spending, higher delinquency fees and, for the nine month period, higher income from equity method investments, which included a portion of the revenue allocated to a joint venture partner as described in Business development expense below, versus a net loss in the prior nine month period. 1 

Processed revenue increased 20 percent and 36 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, and increased 26 percent and 43 percent for the same respective periods on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily driven by increases in processed volumes. 1 

Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher revolving Card Member loan balances, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher rates and the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on interest income. 

1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non-GAAP measure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period without the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 

Card Member loans provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods. The increase for the three month period was primarily due to a reserve build in the current period, versus a reserve release in the prior period, and higher net write-offs. The increase for the nine month period was primarily due to a reserve build in the current period, versus a reserve release in the prior period, partially offset by lower net write-offs. The reserve builds in the current three month and nine month periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The reserve releases in the prior periods were driven by lower delinquencies and improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in loans outstanding. 

Card Member receivables provision for credit losses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to reserve builds in the current periods, versus reserve releases in the prior periods, and higher net write-offs. The reserve builds in the current three month and nine month periods were primarily driven by higher delinquencies. The reserve releases in the prior periods were driven by lower delinquencies and improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in receivables outstanding. 

Card Member rewards expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher billed business as well as higher travel-related redemptions. 

Business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives driven by higher billed business. The year-over-year increase for the nine month period included a charge related to revenue allocated to a joint venture partner for certain categories of transactions. 

Card Member services expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher usage of travel-related benefits. 

Marketing expense decreased 3 percent and increased 6 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively. The year-over-year movements in both the three and nine month periods reflect higher marketing investments to continue building growth momentum. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher technology, servicing and compensation costs. 

In addition to the variance drivers described above, provisions for losses and all expense categories for ICS benefited from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar for both the three and nine month periods.

In addition, if we initiate collection procedures on an account prior to the account becoming 90 days past billing, the associated Card Member receivable balance is classified as 90 days past billing. Corporate receivables delinquency data for periods other than 90+ days past billing and the net write-off rate based on principal losses only are not available due to system constraints.

GMNS operates a global payments network that processes and settles card transactions, acquires merchants and provides multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services and data analytics, leveraging our global integrated network. GMNS manages our partnership relationships with third-party card issuers (including our network partnership agreements in China), merchant acquirers and a prepaid reloadable and gift card program manager, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network. 

Non-interest revenues increased for both the three and nine month periods across all revenue categories. 

Discount revenue increased 22 percent and 28 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by increases in billed business. 

See Tables 5 and 6 for more details on billed business performance. 

Service fees and other revenue increased 30 percent and 32 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily due to higher foreign currency-related revenue. 

Processed revenue increased 12 percent and 16 percent for the three and nine month periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher processed volumes. 

GMNS receives an interest expense credit relating to internal transfer pricing due to its merchant payables. Net interest income increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to higher interest expense credits, largely driven by increases in average merchant payables related to year-over-year billed business growth and higher interest rates. 

Business development expense increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to increased partner payments driven by higher network volumes. 

Marketing expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily due to lower levels of spending on growth initiatives in the current periods compared to the prior periods. 

Salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses increased for both the three and nine month periods, primarily driven by higher compensation expense and a prior year reserve release for merchant exposure associated with Card Member travel-related purchases earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Corporate &#38; Other 

Corporate functions and certain other businesses are included in Corporate &#38; Other. 

Corporate &#38; Other pretax loss was $582 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $282 million for the same period in the prior year, and $1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to $801 million for the same period in the prior year. The increases in pretax loss were primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current periods as compared to net gains on Amex Ventures investments in the prior periods and higher compensation costs, partially offset by lower net losses from Global Business Travel Group, Inc. 

CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 

Our balance sheet management objectives are to maintain: 

&#8226; A solid and flexible equity capital profile; 

&#8226; A broad, deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance our assets and meet operating requirements; and 

&#8226; Liquidity programs that enable us to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve month period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. 

We continue to see volatility in the capital markets due to a variety of factors and manage our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances. 

Capital 

We believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on risk-adjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value. Our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources, such as the exercise of stock options by employees, to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide flexibility to support future business growth, and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See &#8220;Dividends and Share Repurchases&#8221; below. 

We seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, specifically within a 10 to 11 percent target range for American Express Company's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio. 

We maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate. For example, we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements. These infused amounts can affect the capital and liquidity positions at the American Express parent company level or in other subsidiaries. 

We report our capital ratios using the Basel III capital definitions and the Basel III standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. 

The following table presents our regulatory risk-based capital and leverage ratios and those of our U.S. bank subsidiary, American Express National Bank (AENB), as of September 30, 2022:

The following table presents American Express Company's regulatory risk-based capital and risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2022:

The following are definitions for our regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance: 

Risk-Weighted Assets &#8212; Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. 

Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders&#8217; equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below. 

Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the sum of CET1 capital, preferred shares and third-party non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The minimum requirement for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 1.5 percent higher than the minimum for the CET1 risk-based capital ratio. We have $1.6 billion of preferred shares outstanding to help address a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements. 

Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio &#8212; Calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital is the sum of the reserve for loan and receivable credit losses adjusted for the CECL final rules (limited to 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets) and $990 million of eligible subordinated notes, adjusted for capital held by insurance subsidiaries. The $990 million of eligible subordinated notes includes the $750 million subordinated debt issued in May 2022 and the $240 million remaining Tier 2 capital credit for the $600 million subordinated debt issued in December 2014. 

Tier 1 Leverage Ratio &#8212; Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent quarter. 

We elected to delay the impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for two years followed by a three-year phase-in period pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules).We have begun phasing in the $0.7 billion cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at 25 percent per year beginning January 1, 2022. 

As a Category IV firm, we participated in the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2022. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent, which resulted in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7 percent, effective October 1, 2022. 

Dividends and Share Repurchases 

We return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we returned $1.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and share repurchases of $0.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. We repurchased 4.0 million common shares at an average price of $149.33 in the third quarter of 2022. 

In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we paid $14 million and $43 million, respectively, in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding. 

Funding Strategy 

Our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and well-diversified funding sources to allow us to finance our global businesses and to maintain a strong liquidity profile. 

We aim to satisfy our financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale and market relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, and access to secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility. 

Summary of Consolidated Debt 

We had the following customer deposits and consolidated debt outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 

Table 18: Summary of Customer Deposits and Consolidated Debt (Billions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Customer deposits $ 103.5 &#160; $ 84.4 Short-term borrowings 1.5 &#160; 2.2 Long-term debt 42.4 &#160; 38.7 Total customer deposits and debt $ 147.4 &#160; $ 125.3 

We may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities. 

Our funding needs are driven by, among other factors, maturing obligations, our liquidity position and the pace of growth in our loans and receivables balances. Actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors, such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity and funding needs, demand for securities offered by us, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions. Many of these factors are beyond our control. 

The following table presents our debt issuances for the three months ended September 30, 2022: 

Table 19: Debt Issuances (Billions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 American Express Company: Fixed Rate Senior Notes (weighted-average coupon of 3.95%) $ 2.25 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes (4.42% coupon during the fixed rate period and compounded SOFR (a) plus 1.76% during the floating rate period) 

1.25 American Express Credit Account Master Trust: Fixed Rate Class A Certificates (weighted-average coupon of 3.75%) 

2.25 Total $ 5.75 

(a) Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). 

Our equity capital and funding strategies are designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies: Moody&#8217;s Investor Services (Moody&#8217;s), Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s (S&#38;P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Such ratings help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as part of our overall funding strategy. Our asset securitization activities are rated separately. 

Table 20: Unsecured Debt Ratings American Express Entity Moody's S&#38;P Fitch American Express Company Long Term A2 BBB+ A Short Term N/A A-2 F1 Outlook Stable Stable Stable American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization. 

Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs, as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities. Declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We believe our funding mix, including the proportion of U.S. retail deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to total funding, should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs. 

Liquidity Management 

Our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on- and off-balance sheet liquidity sources. We seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. 

Our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; Maintaining diversified funding sources (refer to the &#8220;Funding Strategy&#8221; section for more details); 

&#8226; Maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and off-balance sheet liquidity sources; 

&#8226; Projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios; and 

&#8226; Establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management, including compliance with regulatory requirements. 

The amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time, based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy. The future net interest margin associated with our liquidity resources depends on the difference between our cost of funding these resources and their investment yields. 

Securitized Borrowing Capacity 

As of September 30, 2022, we maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility, with a maturity date of July 15, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $3.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA notes from the American Express Issuance Trust II (the Charge Trust). We also maintained our committed, revolving, secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of September 16, 2024, which gives us the right to sell up to $2.0 billion face amount of eligible AAA certificates from the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust). Both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs, as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources. As of September 30, 2022, no amounts were drawn on the Charge Trust facility or the Lending Trust facility. 

Federal Reserve Discount Window 

As an insured depository institution, AENB may borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge. The Federal Reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window. Whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the Federal Reserve. 

As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $96.2 billion in U.S. credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity, subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria. 

Committed Bank Credit Facility 

In addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above, we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of $3.5 billion as of September 30, 2022, with a maturity date of October 15, 2024. We use this facility from time to time in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs. As of September 30, 2022, $300 million was drawn on this facility, which was repaid in full on October 5, 2022. 

Unused Credit Outstanding 

As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $345 billion of unused credit available to Card Members as part of established lending product agreements. Total unused credit available to Card Members does not represent potential future cash requirements, as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn. Our charge card products generally have no pre-set spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members. 

Cash Flows 

The following table summarizes our cash flow activity, followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating, investing and financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30: 

Table 21: Cash Flows (Billions) 2022 2021 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 12.6 &#160; $ 9.6 Investing activities (22.9) 0.8 Financing activities 18.9 &#160; (15.3) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 0.5 &#160; (0.2) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 9.1 &#160; $ (5.1) 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 

Our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provisions for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred taxes and other non-cash items and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. 

In 2022, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities, primarily resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in Membership Rewards liability driven by higher Card Member spending. 

In 2021, the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period 

and higher net operating liabilities, primarily resulting from an increase in Membership Rewards liability driven by higher Card Member spending. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in Card Member loans and receivables, as well as changes in our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. 

In 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher Card Member loans and receivables outstanding and net purchases of investment securities. 

In 2021, the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by net maturities of our investment securities, 

partially offset by higher Card Member loans and receivables outstanding. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits, long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as dividend payments and share repurchases. 

In 2022, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds from debt issuances and growth in customer deposits, partially offset by debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments. 

In 2021, the net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by debt repayments, share repurchases, decreases in customer deposits, dividend payments and redemption of preferred shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares. 

OTHER MATTERS 

Certain Legislative, Regulatory and Other Developments 

Supervision &#38; Regulation 

We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world, and the costs of compliance are substantial. The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny, high regulatory expectations, a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment. 

Governmental authorities have focused, and we believe will continue to focus, considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations, and we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures. Reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations, as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies, including errors or misconduct by employees or third parties or control failures, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to our products, practices and procedures, restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination. We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations, enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties, in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations. External publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of those investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries. 

For example, as previously disclosed, beginning in May 2020 we began responding to a regulatory review led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Department of Justice Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales. In January 2021, we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of New York regarding the sales practices for small business cards and a Civil Investigative Demand from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) seeking information on sales practices related to consumers. We are cooperating with all inquiries into our sales practices and related compliance practices. We continue to review and enhance our processes and controls related to our sales practices and business conduct generally, take disciplinary and remedial actions where appropriate, and provide information regarding our reviews to our regulators, including the Federal Reserve. We do not believe these matters will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations. 

Please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the 2021 Form 10-K) for further information. 

Consumer Financial Products Regulation 

In the United States, our marketing, sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts or practices. In addition, a number of U.S. states have significant consumer credit protection, disclosure and other laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices, which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws, can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny. Other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly focusing on consumer financial protection. 

For more information on consumer financial products regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Payments Regulation 

Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks, including through enforcement actions, legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers, merchant acquirers and payment networks, and, in some cases, to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems. 

The European Union, Australia, Canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees (that is, the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard), as well as the rules, contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance. Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU and U.K. payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU and the U.K. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU or the U.K. 

Broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include, in some cases, requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations, such as processing infrastructure and data storage, which increases our costs and could diminish the value of our closed loop. The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network. On August 24, 2022, the Reserve Bank of India lifted the restrictions it imposed on American Express Banking Corp.'s ability to onboard new customers as a result of local investments in technology, infrastructure and resources to comply with a regulation requiring storage of payment transaction data exclusively in India. 

For more information on payments regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Surcharging 

In various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Effective October 6, 2022, merchants in Canada (other than in Quebec) are now permitted to surcharge card purchases up to a maximum of 2.4 percent as a result of a litigation settlement with Visa and Mastercard. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. 

For more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the Card Member experience, please see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Merchant Litigation 

We continue to vigorously defend antitrust and other claims initiated by merchants. See Note 7 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; for descriptions of the cases. It is possible that actions impairing the Card Member experience, or the resolution of one or any combination of these merchant claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business. For more information on the potential impacts of an adverse decision in the merchant litigations on our business, please see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security 

Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance, resiliency and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established, and continue to maintain, policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable laws, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. Global financial institutions like us, as well as our customers, employees, regulators, service providers and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing, impersonation and identity takeover attempts), corporate espionage, hacking, website defacement, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems. For more information on privacy, data protection and information and cyber security regulation and the potential impacts of a major information or cyber security incident on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Anti-Money Laundering 

We are subject to significant supervision and regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations. In the United States, the majority of AML requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (the AMLA), enacted in January 2021, amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. AML laws. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, the effects of which are not known at this time. In Europe, AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (and preceding EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. Numerous other countries have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express. 

Among other things, these laws and regulations require us to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Our AML programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries, including certain member states in the EU. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with AML and counter-terrorist financing laws, perceived deficiencies in our AML programs or association of our business with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory, criminal and civil proceedings and lawsuits, which could result in significant penalties and forfeiture of assets, loss of licenses or restrictions on business activities, or other enforcement actions. For more information on AML regulation, as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business, please see the &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters 

On August 4, 2022, we published our 2021-2022 ESG Report, which includes our ESG strategy and objectives in three areas: Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&#38;I); Advancing Climate Solutions; and Building Financial Confidence. The Report follows the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting guidelines, including the results of a qualitative climate-related risk assessment. Potential physical risks related to climate change identified in the TCFD index include severe weather conditions across some of our critical sites. Potential transition risks and opportunities identified in the TCFD index relate to current and emerging regulations, shifting consumer preferences, reputational risks, increased operating costs, impacts to travel patterns and geographic or location-based risks. We continue to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as pursue initiatives to promote DE&#38;I and build financial resilience for our colleagues, customers and communities. 

Other Developments 

As part of an internal review, we identified that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned. This review is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. We currently expect that this review will likely lead to an increase in the liability for Membership Rewards, with a corresponding increase in Card Member rewards expenses, and could result in customer remediation costs. The amount of the increase in the liability, expenses and remediation costs has not yet been determined, but we do not believe it will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

Refer to the Recently Issued Accounting Standards section of Note 1 to the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; 

Glossary of Selected Terminology 

Adjusted net interest income &#8212; A non-GAAP measure that represents net interest income attributable to our Card Member loans (which includes, on a GAAP basis, interest that is deemed uncollectible), excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our Card Member loans. 

Airline-related volume &#8212; Represents spend at airlines as a merchant, which is included within T&#38;E-related volume. 

Asset securitizations &#8212; Asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a special-purpose entity created for the securitization activity, typically a trust. The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Average discount rate &#8212; This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with billed business, drive our discount revenue. 

Billed business (Card Member spending) &#8212; Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express. 

Capital ratios &#8212; Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under &#8220;Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; for further related definitions under Basel III. 

Card Member &#8212; The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card. 

Card Member loans &#8212; Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees. 

Card Member receivables &#8212; Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date. 

Cards-in-force &#8212; Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, except for retail cobrand cards issued by network partners that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base. 

Charge cards &#8212; Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member&#8217;s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time. 

Cobrand cards &#8212; Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner&#8217;s own loyalty program. 

Credit cards &#8212; Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures. 

Discount revenue &#8212; Represents the proportion of billed business earned and retained by us for facilitating transactions between Card Members and merchants on payment products issued by American Express. 

Goods and Services (G&#38;S)-related volume &#8212; Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&#38;E-related merchant categories, which includes B2B spending by small and mid-sized enterprise customers in our CS and ICS segments. 

Interest expense &#8212; Includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate purposes and liquidity needs. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our long-term debt. 

Interest income &#8212; Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income on deposits with banks and other. 

Interest on loans &#8212; Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off. 

Interest and dividends on investment securities &#8212; Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. 

Interest income on deposits with banks and other &#8212; Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and call accounts. 

Loyalty coalitions &#8212; Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support. 

Net card fees &#8212; Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs. 

Net interest yield on average Card Member loans &#8212; A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation. 

Net write-off rate &#8212; principal only &#8212; Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period. 

Net write-off rate &#8212; principal, interest and fees &#8212; Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables. 

Network volumes &#8212; Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes. 

Operating expenses &#8212; Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment, and other expenses. 

Processed revenue &#8212; Represents revenues related to network partnership agreements, comprising royalties, fees and amounts earned for facilitating transactions on cards issued by network partners. Processed revenue also includes fees earned on alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. 

Processed volumes &#8212; Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions facilitated by American Express. 

Reserve build (release) &#8212; Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for credit losses. 

T&#38;E-related volume &#8212; Represents spend on travel and entertainment, which primarily includes airline, cruise, lodging and dining merchant categories.

&#8226; our funding plan being implemented in a manner inconsistent with current expectations, which will depend on various factors such as future business growth, the impact of global economic, political and other events on market capacity, demand for securities we offer, regulatory changes, ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables and the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions;
