 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;hopes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters.

Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

On June 24, 2021, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) announced the results of our 2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. Based on our results, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) beginning October 1, 2021, unchanged from the current level, and our minimum Basel 3 Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio requirement will also remain unchanged at 9.5 percent. 

On July 21, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.21 per share, an increase of 17 percent compared to the prior 

dividend rate, payable on September 24, 2021 to shareholders of record as of September 3, 2021. 

For more information on our capital resources and regulatory developments, see Capital Management on page 22. 

U.K. Tax Law Change 

On June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which increases the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent, effective April 1, 2023. As a result, during the second quarter of 2021, the Corporation recorded a write-up of U.K. net deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion with a corresponding positive income tax adjustment. For more information, see Financial Highlights &#8211; Income Tax Expense on page 6. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Corporation has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic). During the first half of 2021, the macroeconomic outlook improved in the U.S. and several regions of the world, as COVID-19 cases decreased and vaccinations became more widely available. However, uncertainty still remains about the duration of the pandemic and the timing and strength of the global economic recovery. As the pandemic evolves, we continue to review protocols and processes in place to execute our business continuity plans. In conjunction with our efforts to support clients affected by the pandemic, we have cumulatively originated $35.4 billion in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with amounts outstanding of $15.7 billion and $21.1 billion at June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021. For more information on PPP loans, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 35. 

Although the macroeconomic and public health outlooks improved in the U.S. and globally during the first half of 2021, the future direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens, including as the result of the spread of COVID-19 variants that are more easily communicable or resistant to currently available vaccines, such conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could adversely affect our financial condition. 

For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

Following the 2017 announcement by the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that it would no longer compel participating banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021, regulators, trade associations and financial industry working groups have identified recommended replacement rates for LIBOR, as well as other Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), and have published recommended conventions to allow new and existing products to incorporate fallbacks or that reference these alternative reference rates (ARRs). Additionally, as previously disclosed, the FCA announced the dates for the cessation of all LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the ICE Benchmark Administration. In connection with the transition, in April 2021, the State of New York approved legislation for contracts that are governed by New York law by providing a statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured 

3 Bank of America 

Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is anticipated to help the Corporation reduce legal and economic uncertainty with regard to certain LIBOR-based products and contracts that are governed by New York law and have no fallback provisions or have fallback provisions that are based on LIBOR. 

The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide IBOR transition program. As part of this transition program, the Corporation continues to decrease initiation of new U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked commercial loans that mature after June 30, 2023, subject to certain exceptions, and continues to increase the usage of ARRs in its U.S. dollar commercial lending products and contracts. Additionally, the Corporation has ceased initiation of most GBP LIBOR-linked derivatives, subject to certain exceptions, and is prioritizing interdealer trading in SOFR rather than LIBOR for certain U.S. dollar interest rate swaps in accordance with recommendations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The Corporation continues to update its operational models, systems, processes and internal infrastructure. 

While the Corporation continues to work towards meeting the regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones on cessation of LIBOR, the market and client replacement of IBORs 

and adoption of ARRs continue to evolve and, as a result, could impact the ability of market participants and the Corporation to transition activity across or within categories of contracts, products, services and markets. Accordingly, the Corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones, development and adoption of SOFR, credit-sensitive and other rates, access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products, and IBOR continuity. Furthermore, banking regulators in the U.S. and globally have increased regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus of financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness. 

For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net income was $9.2 billion and $17.3 billion, or $1.03 and $1.90 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to $3.5 billion and $7.5 billion, or $0.37 and $0.77 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and a positive income tax adjustment related to the revaluation of U.K. net deferred tax assets, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

Total assets increased $210.3 billion from December 31, 2020 to $3.0 trillion primarily due to the deployment of cash from continued deposit inflows into debt securities, as well as higher trading account assets due to an increase in inventory in Global Markets. 

Total liabilities increased $206.1 billion from December 31, 2020 to $2.8 trillion primarily driven by an increase in deposits due to additional government stimulus measures as well as seasonally higher deposits, higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase due to client activity in Global Markets and an increase in trading account liabilities resulting from higher levels of short positions in Global Markets. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $4.2 billion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to net income, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as well as market value decreases on debt securities and derivatives. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income decreased $615 million to $10.2 billion, and $2.5 billion to $20.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 26 basis points (bps) to 1.61 percent, and 45 bps to 1.64 percent for the same periods. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by higher balances of debt securities. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 45. 

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,586 &#160; $ 1,249 $ 3,021 &#160; $ 2,521 Service charges 1,874 &#160; 1,562 3,666 &#160; 3,465 Investment and brokerage services 4,123 &#160; 3,422 8,186 &#160; 7,180 Investment banking fees 2,122 &#160; 2,159 4,368 &#160; 3,547 Total fees and commissions 9,705 &#160; 8,392 19,241 &#160; 16,713 Market making and similar activities 1,826 &#160; 2,487 5,355 &#160; 5,294 Other income (298) 599 (739) 108 Total noninterest income $ 11,233 &#160; $ 11,478 $ 23,857 &#160; $ 22,115 

Noninterest income decreased $245 million to $11.2 billion and increased $1.7 billion to $23.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Card income increased $337 million and $500 million primarily driven by increased client activity and merchant services revenue. 

&#9679; Service charges increased $312 million and $201 million primarily due to higher treasury fees and increased client activity in the three-month period. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services income increased $701 million and $1.0 billion primarily driven by higher market valuations and assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees increased $821 million for the six-month period primarily driven by higher equity issuance fees as well as advisory and debt issuance fees. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities decreased $661 million for the three-month period primarily driven by higher market-related gains in the prior-year period due to a more robust trading environment for macro products and market recoveries from the end of the first quarter of 2020. 

&#9679; Other income decreased $897 million and $847 million primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans in the prior year as well as higher partnership losses on tax credit investments. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses improved $6.7 billion to a benefit of $1.6 billion and $13.4 billion to a benefit of $3.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020, primarily driven by improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 41.

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Compensation and benefits $ 8,653 &#160; $ 7,994 $ 18,389 &#160; $ 16,335 Occupancy and equipment 1,759 &#160; 1,802 3,589 &#160; 3,504 Information processing and communications 1,448 &#160; 1,265 2,873 &#160; 2,474 Product delivery and transaction related 976 &#160; 811 1,953 &#160; 1,588 Marketing 810 &#160; 492 1,181 &#160; 930 Professional fees 426 &#160; 381 829 &#160; 756 Other general operating 973 &#160; 665 1,746 &#160; 1,298 Total noninterest expense $ 15,045 &#160; $ 13,410 $ 30,560 &#160; $ 26,885 

Noninterest expense increased $1.6 billion to $15.0 billion, and $3.7 billion to $30.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase in the three-month period was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, a $500 million contribution to the Bank of America Foundation and approximately $300 million associated with processing 

transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits. The increase in the six-month period was primarily driven by the same factors as the three-month period as well as elevated net COVID-19 related costs, acceleration of expenses due to incentive compensation award changes, an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, higher revenue-related expenses and higher severance costs. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income before income taxes $ 8,042 &#160; $ 3,799 $ 17,208 &#160; $ 8,330 Income tax expense (1,182) 266 (66) 787 Effective tax rate (14.7) % 7.0 % (0.4) % 9.4 % 

Changes in the effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods a year ago were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits on higher levels of pretax income and the impact of the U.K. tax law change further discussed in this section. Our recurring tax preference benefits primarily consist of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges. Absent these tax credits and the impact of the U.K. tax law change, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 25 percent. 

On June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which increases the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings. As a result, the Corporation recorded a write-up of U.K. net deferred tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion, with a corresponding positive income tax adjustment. This write-up is a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible 

common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 47. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 101. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 8.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 22. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as 

allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Complex Accounting Estimates on page 46 and Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking Results 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking was $3.0 billion compared to $70 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Noninterest income increased $352 million to $2.2 billion driven by higher card income due to increased client activity and higher service charges, partially offset by lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results. 

The provision for credit losses improved $3.7 billion to a benefit of $697 million primarily due to a reserve release, as the macroeconomic outlook improved and our credit quality remained strong. Noninterest expense increased $124 million to $4.9 billion primarily driven by the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation, cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs to support customers and employees. 

The return on average allocated capital was 32 percent, up from one percent, driven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 11. 

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $3.9 billion to $5.7 billion primarily due to improvement in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $960 million to $11.9 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and loan balances, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $235 million to $4.4 billion driven by higher card income due to increased client activity, partially offset by lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses improved $6.6 billion to a benefit of $1.3 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest expense increased $760 million to $10.0 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate rationalization, the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation, cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs to support customers and employees. 

The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, up from 10 percent, driven by higher net income. 

Bank of America 12 

Deposits 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Deposits increased $304 million to $1.1 billion primarily driven by higher revenue. Net interest income increased $181 million to $3.5 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income increased $101 million to $865 million primarily driven by higher service charges, partially offset by other income due to the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $107 million to $47 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Average deposits increased $167.6 billion to $972.0 billion primarily due to net inflows of $94.4 billion in checking and time deposits and $72.1 billion in traditional savings and money market savings driven by strong organic growth and additional government stimulus measures. 

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Deposits decreased $677 million to $1.8 billion primarily driven by lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income declined $489 million to $6.8 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by the 

benefit of growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $84 million to $1.8 billion primarily driven by lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results, as well as lower service charges due to higher deposit balances. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $148 million to $121 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $472 million to $6.1 billion primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization, and the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs to support customers and employees. 

Average deposits increased $177.0 billion to $944.8 billion primarily due to net inflows of $103.4 billion in checking and time deposits and $72.7 billion in traditional savings and money market savings driven by strong organic growth and additional government stimulus measures. 

The table below provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. For more information about Global Markets , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 7. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets decreased $987 million to $908 million. Net DVA losses were $34 million compared to losses of $261 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $1.2 billion to $934 million. These decreases were primarily driven by higher noninterest expense and lower revenue, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. 

Revenue decreased $630 million to $4.7 billion primarily driven by lower sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue decreased $590 million, and excluding net DVA, decreased $817 million. These decreases were driven by lower revenue in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), partially offset by higher revenue in Equities. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $83 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Noninterest expense increased $787 million to $3.5 billion driven by higher costs associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits and activity-related expenses for sales and trading. 

Average total assets increased $134.5 billion to $797.6 billion driven by higher client balances in Global Equities, and higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC. 

The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, down from 21 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 11. 

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets decreased $638 million to $3.0 billion. Net DVA losses were $36 million compared to gains of $39 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $581 million to $3.0 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by higher noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $343 million to $10.9 billion primarily driven by higher investment banking income. Sales and trading revenue decreased $147 million, and excluding net DVA, decreased $72 million driven by a decline in FICC revenue, partially offset by higher revenue in Equities. Noninterest expense increased $1.4 billion to $6.9 billion, primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion, as well as an acceleration in expenses from incentive compensation award changes. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $195 million primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. 

Average total assets increased $72.6 billion to $760.6 billion, primarily due to higher client balances in Global Equities. Period-end total assets increased $157.1 billion since December 31, 2020 to $773.7 billion driven by higher client balances and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Global Equities, and higher levels of inventory and loan growth in FICC. 

The return on average allocated capital was 16 percent, down from 20 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital.

Bank of America 20 

Three-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue decreased $1.2 billion as the prior year benefited from a robust trading environment for macro products and market recoveries from the end of the first quarter of 2020, whereas markets were more benign in the current-year period and weak for agency mortgages. Equities revenue increased $404 million driven by stronger trading performance and increased client activity in derivatives and Asia. 

Six-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue decreased $641 million driven by reduced activity in macro products, partially offset by stronger performance in credit and municipal products, and gains in commodities (partially offset by related losses in another segment) from market volatility driven by a weather-related event. Equities revenue increased $569 million driven by stronger trading performance and increased client activity.

All Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income increased $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion primarily driven by an increase in the income tax benefit, partially offset by lower revenue. 

Revenue decreased $1.2 billion primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans in the prior-year period and lower market making and similar activities. 

The income tax benefit increased $2.8 billion primarily due to the impact of the U.K. tax law change and a higher level of income tax credits associated with increased ESG investment 

activities. For more information on the U.K. tax law change, see Financial Highlights on page 4. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 

Six-Month Comparison

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt and Note 12 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation&#8217;s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line-of-business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. 

For more information about the Corporation &#8217; s risks related to the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pandemic-related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. 

For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more 

information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. We submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests in April 2021 and received our results on June 24, 2021. Based on our results, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent SCB, unchanged from the current level, effective October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2022. Our CET1 capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 

Due to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve imposed various restrictions on share repurchase programs and dividends. In conjunction with its release of 2021 CCAR supervisory stress test results, the Federal Reserve announced those restrictions would end as of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the Corporation, and large banks would be subject to the normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. 

On April 15, 2021, the Corporation announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time. The Board also authorized repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased $4.2 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the period. 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases made pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of June 30, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer or SCB, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely 

Bank of America 22 

of CET1 capital. The Corporation's CET1 capital ratio must be a minimum of 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be 

considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

Table 8 presents Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

(1) As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard. 

(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB or the capital conservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021 and is not reflected in supplementary leverage exposure at June 30, 2021. 

At June 30, 2021, CET1 capital was $178.8 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by earnings, partially offset by common stock repurchases, dividends, the increase in deferred tax assets due to the change in U.K. tax law and lower net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). Tier 1 capital increased $2.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital. Total capital under the Standardized approach decreased $3.5 billion primarily driven by a decrease in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital, partially offset by 

the same factors driving the increase in CET1 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at June 30, 2021, increased $71.9 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $1,552 billion primarily due to strong client activity in Global Markets and investments of excess liquidity. Supplementary leverage exposure at June 30, 2021 increased $658.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to the expiration of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s temporary relief to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the 

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. 

(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation&#8217;s Method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. 

(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after March 31, 2021 and is not reflected in supplementary leverage exposure at June 30, 2021. 

Regulatory Developments 

The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio 

On March 19, 2021, the U.S. banking regulators announced that the temporary change to the SLR for BHCs and depository institutions issued in 2020 would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021. While the temporary relief automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation&#8217;s lead depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At June 30, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s SLR, reflecting the expiration of the temporary relief, was 5.9 percent, which is 0.9 percent, or $30 billion, in excess of the 5.0 percent required by the Federal Reserve. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to CFTC Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum 

net capital requirement. At June 30, 2021, BofAS had tentative net capital of $18.0 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $15.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.0 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At June 30, 2021, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $5.7 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At June 30, 2021, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $3.7 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $182 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2021, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.9 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $14.8 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2021, BofASE's capital resources were $7.2 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $2.7 billion. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we 

Bank of America 26 

can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 13 Average Global Liquidity Sources Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2021 December 31 2020 Bank entities $ 909 &#160; $ 773

154 &#160; 170 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources 

$ 1,063 &#160; $ 943 

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $300 billion and $306 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. 

Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2021 December 31 2020 Cash on deposit $ 247 &#160; $ 322 U.S. Treasury securities 227 &#160; 141 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $602 billion and $584 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 117 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule 

On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule was effective July 1, 2021. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. The Corporation is in compliance with 

27 Bank of America 

the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline provided, and there have not been any significant impacts to the Corporation. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.91 trillion and $1.80 trillion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Long-term Debt 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we issued $48.2 billion of long-term debt consisting of $36.9 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $4.4 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $6.9 billion of other debt. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $29.0 billion consisting of $17.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $5.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.0 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2021.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt increased $11.7 billion to $274.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to debt issuances, partially offset by debt maturities and redemptions and valuation adjustments. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we issued $2.2 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be 

required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

We use derivative transactions to manage interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 45. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. 

Bank of America 28 

On May 24, 2021, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings (S&#38;P) affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook to Positive from Stable. 

On June 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) upgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation and its rated subsidiaries by one notch, to AA- and AA, respectively. Fitch also upgraded the Corporation&#8217;s short-term rating to F1+ which is now aligned with the short-term rating of its subsidiaries, including BANA. Following the upgrade, the rating outlook for the Corporation and its subsidiaries is Stable. 

The current ratings and Stable outlooks for the Corporation and its subsidiaries from Moody's Investors Service did not change from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the economy gained momentum as unemployment continued to decline from double-digit highs during 2020 and parts of the economy continued to open as vaccination rates increased, case levels showed improvements and restrictions generally began to ease. Individuals and businesses in the U.S. continue to receive various forms of support through economic stimulus packages enacted in 2020 and 2021. While there has been improvement, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the economy's recovery, which could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

The economic environment improved during the six months ended June 30, 2021, with the U.S. unemployment rate continuing to decline and home prices increasing. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, net charge-offs decreased $221 million and $400 million to $513 million and $1.2 billion primarily due to lower credit card losses, as balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures were partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, nonperforming loans increased due to deferral activity. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $2.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $7.4 billion primarily due to an improved economic outlook. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 41.

For more information on non-core loans, see Consumer Credit Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage includes $501 million and $537 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $186 million and $225 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. 

(3) Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $46.4 billion and $46.4 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $46.4 billion and $41.1 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(4) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $257 million and $298 million and home equity loans of $397 million and $437 million at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(5) Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $13 million and $11 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2021. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer 

Banking and 42 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association, as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $9.2 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 as paydowns were partially offset by originations. 

At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the residential mortgage portfolio included $12.5 billion and $11.8 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements.

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(3) These vintages of loans accounted for $458 million, or 20 percent, and $503 million, or 25 percent, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $338 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily driven by deferral activity. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2021, $1.2 billion, or 53 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $315 million driven by continued improvement in credit quality. 

Net recoveries of $6 million and $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same periods in the prior year. 

Of the $201.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2021, as shown in Table 20, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $5.3 billion, or nine percent, at June 30, 2021. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2021, $66 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more 

compared to $909 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2021, $314 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $112 million were contractually current, compared to $2.3 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 98 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. 

Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 16 percent of outstandings at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Home Equity 

At June 30, 2021, the home equity portfolio made up seven percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At June 30, 2021, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $3.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing 

lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $12.8 billion, or 42 percent, and $13.8 billion, or 40 percent, were in first-lien positions. At June 30, 2021, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where 

we also held the first-lien loan totaled $5.1 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $41.0 billion and $42.3 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The HELOC utilization rate was 41 percent and 43 percent at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $21 million and $25 million and nonperforming loans include $90 million and $88 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(3) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(4) These vintages of loans accounted for 35 percent and 36 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio remained relatively unchanged at $651 million at June 30, 2021. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2021, $264 million, or 41 percent were current on contractual payments. In addition, $246 million, or 38 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $19 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021. 

Net recoveries increased $10 million to $24 million and $34 million to $59 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase was driven by favorable portfolio trends due partly to improvement in home prices. 

Of the $30.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2021, as shown in Table 21, 15 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $8.0 billion at June 30, 2021. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2021, $107 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2021, $473 million, or six percent, were 

nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 

Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, 19 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 

Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Credit Card 

At June 30, 2021, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $3.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $75.6 billion as increased payments more than offset higher purchase volumes as spending continued to recover. Net charge-offs decreased $177 million to $488 million and $313 million to $1.1 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to balance declines and the impact of government stimulus measures, partially offset by charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired 

in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $713 million, and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $370 million primarily due to charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired in 2020 and the impact of government stimulus measures. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $351.1 billion at June 30, 2021 from $342.4 billion at December 31, 2020.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At June 30, 2021, 48 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 52 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased by $5.5 billion during 

the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $96.9 billion driven by client demand for liquidity and high asset values in the securities-based lending portfolio.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, nonperforming consumer loans increased $319 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by consumer real estate deferral activity. 

At June 30, 2021, $823 million, or 27 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at June 30, 2021, $1.6 billion, or 51 

percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current 

loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $30 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $93 million as the Corporation has continued to pause formal loan foreclosure proceedings and foreclosure sales for occupied properties during 2021. 

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 25.

(2) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of loans that were fully-insured. 

(3) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $405 million and $407 million, and include $234 million and $216 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $171 million and $191 million of loans classified as performing. 

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. 

Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $673 million and $701 million, of which $600 million and $614 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms.

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 31, 34 and 37 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 38. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio as well as interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, commercial asset quality improved as the economic recovery gained momentum amid COVID-19 containment and vaccination progress. Accordingly, charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $1.7 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Markets with most of the increase in investment grade exposures. This increase was largely offset by lower U.S. small business 

commercial loans due to PPP forgiveness. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun to stabilize in many sectors as economies have reopened. However, certain sectors, including hospitality and retail, while showing signs of improvement, continue to be negatively impacted due to the pandemic. Moreover, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $2.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $6.7 billion primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 41. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $7.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $613.0 billion primarily driven by lower derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at June 30, 2021 and 57 percent at December 31, 2020. 

Table 27 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At June 30, 2021, 61 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 21 percent in Global Markets , 16 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $2.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 driven by Global Markets . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $6.5 billion, which was broad-based across industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At June 30, 2021, 72 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 28 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $7.7 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2021 primarily in Global Markets . For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 40. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans declined by $758 million during the six months ended June 30, 2021 as paydowns exceeded new originations. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 24 percent and 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and includes $15.7 billion and $22.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The decline of $7.0 billion in PPP loans during the six months ended June 30, 2021 was due to repayment of the loans by the Small Business Administration under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 51 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. 

small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 100 percent and 95 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to 95 percent and 92 percent for the same periods in 2020.

months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $364 million to $1.9 billion. At June 30, 2021, 78 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were 

secured and 59 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 88 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming. 

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. 

(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Table 33 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are 

not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.

Industry Concentrations 

Table 34 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $34.7 billion, or three percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2021 to $1.1 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Finance companies, Healthcare equipment and services and Media industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the Government and public education and Vehicle dealers industry sectors.

Given the widespread impact of the pandemic on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are 

experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. For more information on the pandemic, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.

(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.9 billion and $10.5 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.6 billion and $4.2 billion. For these same positions, we recorded net losses of $32 million and $68 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to net losses of $231 million and $2 million for the same periods in 2020. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related 

exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 40. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 43. 

Tables 35 and 36 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 37 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2021. These exposures accounted for 91 percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $37.9 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Japan, Switzerland and Ireland, increased exposure with central clearing counterparts in the U.K. and increased corporate exposure in Canada.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at June 30, 2021 was the U.K. with net exposure of $64.9 billion, which represents a $5.4 billion increase from December 31, 2020. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $40.6 billion at June 30, 2021, a $4.3 billion decrease from December 31, 2020. 

In light of the global pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will likely continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact to our international business operations as part of our overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure

carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. While vaccines have become more widely available in certain countries, the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. The impact of the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on the pandemic, see Item 1A.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses decreased by $4.9 billion from December 31, 2020 to $15.8 billion at June 30, 2021, which included a $2.2 billion reserve decrease related to the commercial portfolio and a $2.7 billion reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio. The decreases were primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook.

Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were $595 million and $1.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the same periods in 2020 driven by decreases across most products. The provision for credit losses decreased $6.7 billion to a $1.6 billion benefit, and $13.4 billion to a $3.5 billion benefit, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The allowance for credit losses had a reserve release of $4.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $3.3 billion to a $707 million benefit and $6.2 billion to a $1.5 billion benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the 

same periods in 2020. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $3.4 billion to a $914 million benefit and $7.2 billion to a $2.0 billion benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or 

otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily 

within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

Bank of America 42 

We have been affected, and may continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Coronavirus Disease of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 40 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option 

portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 40 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 40 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020 using a 99 percent confidence level, as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. The amounts disclosed in Table 40 and Table 41 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an increase in interest rate risk, partially offset by an increased diversification benefit between asset classes.

(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. 

The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 40.

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 41 at the same level of detail as in Table 40. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not 

necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 41 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 

percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This 

compares to the three months ended March 31, 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. 

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book 

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 42 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Table 42 Forward Rates June 30, 2021 &#160; Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 &#160; % 0.15 &#160; % 1.44 &#160; % 12-month forward rates 0.25 &#160; 0.27 &#160; 1.65 &#160; December 31, 2020 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.24 % 0.93 % 12-month forward rates 0.25 0.19 1.06 

Table 43 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily due to ALM activity and an increase in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 22.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 43. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is insignificant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

45 Bank of America 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded gains of $9 million and $22 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $65 million and $228 million for the same periods in 2020. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change. The financial impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk. Physical risk can also lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or collateral values. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk Framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. For more information on our governance framework and climate risk management process, see the Managing Risk and the Climate Risk Management sections in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more 

information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Table 44 presents goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of the periods presented.

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2021 by using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessment include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. Based on our qualitative assessment, we have concluded that it was not &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the reporting units &#8217; fair values were less than their carrying values.
