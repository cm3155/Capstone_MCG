 Item 1. Business 

Bank of America Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company.

Segments 

Through our various bank and nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking , Global Wealth &#38; Investment Management (GWIM) , Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other .

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit card issuers, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, and e-commerce and other internet-based companies. We compete with some of these competitors globally and with others on a regional or product-specific basis. 

Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, technology, price, fees, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits, customer convenience and experience and relationships in relevant markets. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. 

Human Capital Resources 

We strive to make Bank of America a great place to work for our employees. We value our employees and seek to establish and maintain human resource policies that are consistent with our core values and that help realize the power of our people. Our Board and its Compensation and Human Capital Committee provide oversight of our human capital management strategies, programs and practices. The Corporation&#8217;s senior management provides regular briefings on human capital matters to the Board and its Committees to facilitate the Board&#8217;s oversight. 

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation employed approximately 208,000 and 213,000 employees, of which 80 percent and 82 percent were located in the U.S., respectively. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, in 2021 and 2020, the Corporation&#8217;s compensation and benefits expense was $36.1 billion and $32.7 billion, or 61 percent and 59 percent, of total noninterest expense. 

Diversity and Inclusion 

The Corporation&#8217;s commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with oversight from our Board and CEO. The Corporation&#8217;s senior management sets the diversity and inclusion goals, and the Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity &#38; Inclusion Officer partner with our CEO and senior management to drive our diversity and inclusion strategy, programs, initiatives and policies. The Global Diversity and Inclusion Council, which consists of senior executives from every line of business and region, is chaired by our CEO and has 

##TABLE_START Bank of America 2 

##TABLE_END

been in place for over 20 years. The Council sponsors and supports business, operating unit and regional diversity and inclusion councils to ensure alignment with enterprise diversity strategies and goals. 

Our practices and policies have resulted in strong representation across the Corporation where our broad employee population mirrors the clients and communities we serve. We have a Board and senior management team that are 50 percent and 55 percent racially, ethnically and gender diverse. As of December 31, 2021, of global employees who self-identified, 50 percent of employees were women, and, among U.S.-based employees who self-identified, 49 percent were people of color, including 13 percent who were Asian, 14 percent who were Black/African American and 19 percent who were Hispanic/Latino. As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s top three management levels in relation to the CEO were composed of more than 42 percent women globally and 24 percent people of color in the U.S., including eight percent who were Asian, nine percent who were Black/African American and six percent who were Hispanic/Latino. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, the Corporation&#8217;s managers at all levels were composed of 42 percent women globally and 41 percent people of color in the U.S., including 13 percent who were Asian, 10 percent who were Black/African American and 16 percent who were Hispanic/Latino. These workforce diversity metrics are reported regularly to the senior management team and to the Board. 

We invest in our talent by offering a range of development programs and resources that allow employees to develop and progress in their careers. We reinforce our commitment to diversity and inclusion by investing internally in our employee networks and by facilitating enterprise-wide learning and conversations about various diversity and inclusion topics and issues. Further, we partner with various external organizations, which focus on advancing diverse talent. We also have practices in place for attracting and retaining diverse talent, including campus recruitment. For example, in 2021, 46 percent of our global campus hires were women, and, in the U.S., 53 percent were people of color. 

Employee Engagement and Talent Retention 

As part of our ongoing efforts to make the Corporation a great place to work, we have conducted a confidential annual Employee Engagement Survey (Survey) for nearly two decades. The Survey results are reviewed by the Board and senior management and used to assist in reviewing the Corporation&#8217;s human capital strategies, programs and practices. In 2021, 89 percent of the Corporation&#8217;s employees participated in the Survey, and our Employee Engagement Index, an overall measure of employee satisfaction with the Corporation, was 88 percent. Our turnover among employees was 12 percent in 2021 and seven percent in 2020. Our pre-pandemic levels of turnover in 2019 and 2018 were 11 percent and 12 percent. 

Additionally, the Corporation provides a variety of resources to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including resources to help employees find new opportunities, re-skill and seek leadership positions. The learning and development strategy is grounded in the development of horizontal skills delivered throughout the organization. Senior leaders, managers and teammates are onboarded and build horizontal skills, as well as role-specific skills, to drive high performance. This approach also facilitates internal mobility and promotion of talent to build a bench of qualified managers and leaders. In 2021, more than 26,000 employees found new roles within the Corporation and we 

delivered more than 10 million hours of training and development to our teammates through the Corporation&#8217;s training academy. 

Fair and Equitable Compensation 

The Corporation is committed to racial and gender pay equity by striving to compensate all of our employees fairly and equitably. We maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce our commitment, including reviews conducted by a third-party consultant with oversight from our Board and senior management. In 2021, our review covered our regional hubs (U.S., U.K., France, Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore) and India and showed that compensation received by women, on average, was greater than 99 percent of that received by men in comparable positions and, in the U.S., compensation received by people of color was, on average, greater than 99 percent of that received by teammates who are not people of color in comparable positions. 

We also strive to pay our employees fairly based on market rates for their roles, experience and how they perform. We regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our industry to help ensure our pay is competitive. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we raised our minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $21 per hour, which is above all governmental minimum wage levels in all jurisdictions in which we operate in the U.S., and announced plans to increase to $25 per hour by 2025. 

Health and Wellness &#8211; 2021 Focus 

The Corporation also is committed to supporting employees&#8217; physical, emotional and financial wellness by offering flexible and competitive benefits, including comprehensive health and insurance benefits and wellness resources. In 2021, we continued efforts to support our employees through the ongoing health crisis resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic). We continued to monitor guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, medical boards and health authorities and prioritized sharing such guidance with our teammates. Other benefits and resources related to the pandemic included offering no-cost COVID-19 testing, paid time off to allow teammates to get vaccinated for COVID-19, providing teammates with incentives for getting the vaccine and booster, hosting a medical expert education series and providing on-site COVID-19 vaccine and booster clinics. 

We continued our efforts around providing affordable access to healthcare, including offering no-cost, 24/7 access to virtual general medical and behavioral health resources to help our enrolled U.S. teammates stay healthy, both physically and emotionally. We kept U.S. health insurance premiums unchanged for teammates earning less than $50,000 for the ninth year in a row, and had nominal premium increases for teammates earning from $50,000 to $100,000 for the fifth year in a row. We also provided preventative care medications at no cost for U.S. teammates enrolled in the Bank&#8217;s medical plan. 

We have expanded our child and adult care solutions for eligible U.S. teammates to help better support their families and dependents, including providing up to 50 days of backup care for both adults and children and expanding access to our reimbursement program to help employees manage child care expenses. Additional support to working parents includes parental leave and time off from work to care for and bond with a newborn or adopted child (16 weeks paid plus 10 weeks unpaid for a total of up to 26 weeks).

For more information about our human capital management, see the Corporation&#8217;s website and 2021 Annual Report to shareholders that will be available on the Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2022 (the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 

Government Supervision and Regulation 

The following discussion describes, among other things, elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies, banks and broker-dealers, including specific information about Bank of America. 

We are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to BHCs, financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities. U.S. federal regulation of banks, BHCs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. 

As a registered financial holding company and BHC, the Corporation is subject to the supervision of, and regular inspection by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). Our U.S. bank subsidiaries (the Banks), organized as national banking associations, are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design, implementation and board oversight of BHCs&#8217; and national banks&#8217; risk governance frameworks. U.S. financial holding companies, and the companies under their control, are permitted to engage in activities considered &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Reserve interpretations. The Corporation's status as a financial holding company is conditioned upon maintaining certain eligibility requirements for both the Corporation and its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries, including minimum capital ratios, supervisory ratings and, in the case of the depository institutions, at least satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Failure to be an eligible financial holding company could result in the Federal Reserve limiting Bank of America's activities, including potential acquisitions. 

The scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased over the past several years, beginning with the response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. In addition, the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Financial Reform Act). We cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision. 

We are also subject to various other laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities, management and ability to make distributions to shareholders. For instance, our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both U.S. and international regulation, including supervision by the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and New York Stock Exchange, among others; our futures commission merchant subsidiaries supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the U.S. are subject to regulation by and 

supervision of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), National Futures Association, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and in the case of the Banks, certain banking regulators; our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies; and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 

Our non-U.S. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various non-U.S. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, prudential regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies, in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. For example, our financial services entities in the United Kingdom (U.K.), Ireland and France are subject to regulation by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland, and the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, respectively. 

Source of Strength 

Under the Financial Reform Act and Federal Reserve policy, BHCs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC, either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to FDIC assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default, the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the FDIC&#8217;s loss, subject to certain exceptions. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Pursuant to Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, the Banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates. In general, U.S. banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving their nonbank affiliates. Additionally, transactions between U.S. banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm&#8217;s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness. 

Deposit Insurance 

Deposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC&#8217;s regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits are $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the DIF. 

The FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The FDIC adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. As of the date of this report, the DIF ratio is below this required target, and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. For more information regarding deposit insurance, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Regulatory, Compliance and Legal on page 18.

##TABLE_END

Capital, Liquidity and Operational Requirements 

As a financial holding company, we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and the FDIC. These rules are complex and are evolving as U.S. and international regulatory authorities propose and enact amendments to these rules. The Corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and to support our business activities. These continually evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity, as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the Corporation. 

For more information on regulatory capital rules, capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes, see Capital Management on page 49, and Note 16 &#8211; Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1. 

Distributions 

We are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions, including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases. For instance, Federal Reserve regulations require major U.S. BHCs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). 

Our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and non-capital standards established under the FDICIA. To the extent that the Federal Reserve increases our stress capital buffer (SCB), global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease. As part of its CCAR, the Federal Reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the Federal Reserve. Those scenarios may affect our CCAR stress test results, which may impact the level of our SCB. Additionally, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing common stock dividends or repurchasing common stock. For example, as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, in the second half of 2020 the Federal Reserve introduced certain limitations to capital distributions for all large banks, including the Corporation, which were removed effective July 1, 2021. 

If the Federal Reserve finds that any of our Banks are not &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; or &#8220;well-managed,&#8221; we would be required to enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements, which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities. Additionally, the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or BHC, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. 

For more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including the minimum capital requirements, see Note 13 &#8211; Shareholders&#8217; Equity and Note 16 &#8211; Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the 

flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. The rights of the Corporation, our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries are further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries. 

Resolution Planning 

As a BHC with greater than $250 billion of assets, the Corporation is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. 

Such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the BHC, including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its material entities, pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance. 

If both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that the BHC&#8217;s plan is not credible, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations. A summary of our plan is available on the Federal Reserve and FDIC websites. 

The FDIC also requires the submission of a resolution plan for Bank of America, National Association (BANA), which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A description of this plan is available on the FDIC&#8217;s website. 

We continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability, which includes continued improvements to our preparedness capabilities to implement our resolution plan, both from a financial and operational standpoint. 

Across international jurisdictions, resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities (RA). Among those, the jurisdictions with the greatest impact to the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries are the U.K., Ireland and France, where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locally incorporated subsidiaries as well as the Corporation&#8217;s banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes. As a result of the RA's review of the submitted information, we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries. 

For more information regarding our resolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Liquidity on page 10. 

Insolvency and the Orderly Liquidation Authority 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may be appointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances. In addition, under the Financial Reform Act, when a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) such as the Corporation is in default or danger of default, the FDIC may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution. In the event of such appointment, the FDIC could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, if the Secretary of the Treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. The orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, but also adopts certain concepts from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

##TABLE_START 

5 Bank of America 

##TABLE_END

The orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For example, in certain circumstances, the FDIC could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant (e.g., short-term creditors or operating creditors) in lieu of paying other obligations (e.g., long-term creditors) without the need to obtain creditors&#8217; consent or prior court review. The insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a BHC&#8217;s outstanding equity, as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s &#8220;single point of entry&#8221; strategy for resolving SIFIs, the FDIC could replace a distressed BHC with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original BHC. 

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve requires that BHCs maintain minimum levels of long-term debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution. 

For more information regarding our resolution, see Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Liquidity on page 10. 

Limitations on Acquisitions 

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits a BHC to acquire banks located in states other than its home state without regard to state law, subject to certain conditions, including the condition that the BHC, after and as a result of the acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state. At June 30, 2021, we held greater than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the U.S. 

In addition, the Financial Reform Act restricts acquisitions by a financial institution if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial institution would exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S. At June 30, 2021, our liabilities did not exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the U.S. 

The Volcker Rule 

The Volcker Rule prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (collectively, banking entities) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options for their own account. The Volcker Rule also imposes limits on banking entities&#8217; investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule provides exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities and organizing and offering hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker or custodian. A banking entity with significant trading operations, such as the Corporation, is required to maintain a detailed compliance program to comply with the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. 

Derivatives 

Our derivatives operations are subject to extensive regulation globally. These operations are subject to regulation under the Financial Reform Act, the European Union (EU) Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, analogous U.K. regulatory regimes and similar regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions that regulate or will regulate the derivatives markets in which we 

operate by, among other things: requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives; enforcing existing or imposing new capital, margin, reporting, registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants; imposing position limits on certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives; and imposing derivatives trading transparency requirements. These regulations are already in effect in many markets in which we operate. 

In addition, many G-20 jurisdictions, including the U.S., U.K., and Japan, have adopted resolution stay regulations to address concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial contracts in resolution could impede orderly resolution of G-SIBs, and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit. In addition, the EU has implemented EU-wide resolution stay requirements. Generally, these resolution stay regulations require amendment of certain financial contracts to provide for contractual recognition of stays of termination rights under various statutory resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of cross-default rights based on an affiliate&#8217;s entry into insolvency proceedings. As resolution stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction applicable to us go into effect, we amend impacted financial contracts in compliance with such regulations either as a regulated entity or as a counterparty facing a regulated entity in such jurisdiction. 

Consumer Regulations 

Our consumer businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by federal and state regulators. Certain federal consumer finance laws to which we are subject, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP), Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act, are enforced by the CFPB. Other federal consumer finance laws, such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, are enforced by the OCC. 

Privacy and Information Security 

We are subject to many U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures regarding the disclosure, use and protection of the non-public confidential information of our customers and employees. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires us to periodically disclose Bank of America&#8217;s privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties, under certain circumstances. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other laws also require us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to provide the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. Security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. 

Other laws and regulations, at the international, federal and state level, impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or contact customers with marketing offers and establish certain rights of consumers in connection with their personal information. For example, California&#8217;s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect in January 2020, as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), provides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected, know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom and opt out of the sale of their personal data, 

##TABLE_START Bank of America 6 

##TABLE_END

among other rights. In addition, in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive and related implementing national laws in its member states. The CCPA's, CPRA's and GDPR&#8217;s impact on the Corporation was assessed and addressed through comprehensive compliance implementation programs. These existing and evolving legal requirements in the U.S. and abroad, as well as court proceedings and changing guidance from regulatory bodies with respect to the validity of cross-border data transfer mechanisms from the EU, continue to lend uncertainty to privacy compliance globally.
