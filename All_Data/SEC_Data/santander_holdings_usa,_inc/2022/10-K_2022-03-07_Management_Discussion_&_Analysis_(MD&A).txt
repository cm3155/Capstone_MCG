 ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association; SC, a consumer finance company headquartered in Dallas, Texas; SSLLC, a broker-dealer headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami, Florida that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; SFS, a consumer credit institution headquartered in Puerto Rico; and several other subsidiaries. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and SB NA's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SSLLC and SIS are registered investment advisers with the SEC. SHUSA's two largest subsidiaries by asset size and revenue are SBNA and SC. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. 

As of December 31, 2021, SC was owned approximately 80.2% by SHUSA and 19.8% by other shareholders. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on SHUSA's January 31, 2022 acquisition of the remainder of SC's outstanding shares. 

SBNA's primary business consists of attracting deposits and providing other retail banking services through its network of retail branches, and originating small business loans, middle market, large and global commercial loans, multifamily loans, and auto and other consumer loans throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern areas of the United States, principally located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. SBNA uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. SBNA earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, SBNA generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. SBNA's principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of SBNA are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within SBNA's geographic footprint. 

SC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing and delivering service to dealers and customers across the full credit spectrum. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and servicing of RICs and auto leases, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. Additionally, SC sells consumer RICs through flow agreements and, when market conditions are favorable, it accesses the ABS market through securitizations of consumer RICs. SAF is SC&#8217;s primary vehicle financing brand, and is available as a finance option for automotive dealers across the United States. Further information about SC&#8217;s business is provided below in the &#8220;CCAP&#8221; section. 

SC is managed through a single reporting segment which includes vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products. 

SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. 

CCAP 

Since May 2013, under the MPLFA with Stellantis, the Company has operated as Stellantis's preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to Stellantis customers and dealers under the CCAP brand. The Company's average penetration rate under the MPLFA for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 31%, a decrease from 34% for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

SC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its CCAP business and has pursued a strategy of working collaboratively with Stellantis to continue to strengthen their relationship and create value within the CCAP program. During the year ended December 31, 2021, SC originated $14.0 billion in CCAP loans, which represented 52% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, as well as $7.6 billion in CCAP leases. Additionally, all of the leases originated by SC during year ended December 31, 2021 were under the MPLFA. 

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Overview 

The unemployment rate at December 31, 2021 was 4.0% compared to 4.8% at September 30, 2021 and 6.7% one year ago, which represented an improvement off the April 2020 peak of unemployment associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the improvement from March 2021 reflects the continuing resumption of economic activity, particularly in the leisure and hospitality, public and private education, professional and business services, retail trade and other services. 

Market year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at December 31, 2021 were: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 Dow Jones Industrial Average 18.7% S&#38;P 500 26.9% NASDAQ Composite 21.4% ##TABLE_END

In light of the effects the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on economic activity, at its December 2021 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 0.00% to 0.25% . The Committee expects to maintain this target rate until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation to remain at the targeted rate of 2.0% . 

The ten-year Treasury bond rate at December 31, 2021 was 1.51% , up from 0.92% at December 31, 2020. Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates. 

Changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated credit loss expense and legal expense . 

Credit Rating Actions 

The following table presents Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch credit ratings for SBNA, SHUSA, and Santander senior debt / long-term issuer rating:

SHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely relat ed to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA. 

At this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

The activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including SBNA and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent, Santander. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's subsidiaries are further supervised by the OCC, the FRB of Atlanta, and the NYDFS. 

Payment of Divid ends 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described under the caption &#8220;Stress Tests and Capital Planning&#8221; in this section. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period. 

In June 2020, the Federal Reserve Board announced the Interim Policy, to be applied in the third quarter of 2020, which provided that certain large CCAR banks, including SHUSA, cannot pay common stock dividends that exceed the institution&#8217;s average trailing four quarters of net income. The Interim Policy also prohibited these banks from implementing share purchase programs, except to make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans. 

In July 2020, SC announced that the Federal Reserve had approved certain exceptions to the Interim Policy and that SC was permitted to pay a dividend and continue its share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2020. 

Subsequently, the Federal Reserve extended and revised the Interim Policy through the first quarter of 2021. SC subsequently announced that the Federal Reserve approved certain exceptions to the Interim Policy and that SC was permitted to pay first and second quarter 2021 common stock dividends. 

The Federal Reserve announced termination of the Interim Policy and the temporary capital distribution restrictions expired on June 30, 2021. Large firms (including SHUSA) remain subject to the normal restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Board's regulatory capital framework, inclusive of the SCB. 

As a result of the potential PCH acquisition announced in August 2021, SHUSA was required to resubmit its 2021 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. While the Federal Reserve reviews the resubmitted capital plan, SHUSA must continue to request approval to pay dividends. SHUSA requested and the Federal Reserve approved payment of the SC common dividend for the Q3 2021 and Q4 2021 periods. SHUSA must continue to request approval to pay dividends until the Federal Reserve responds to the resubmitted capital plan and PCH acquisition application. After these responses, SHUSA expects to be subject to the normal restriction imposed by the SCB. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and SBNA. 

These rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations, including the Company and SBNA, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions to make capital distributions, including paying dividends. 

As described in Note 1 to these Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL standard, which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance, net of income tax, and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2.5 billion. The U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations, including the Company, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. On March 26, 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. This interim rule was subsequently updated with technical amendments in a final rule dated September 30, 2020. The Company has elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. 

See the "Bank Regulatory Capital" section of this MD&#38;A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company. 

Material restrictions can be imposed on SBNA, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized banks generally may not make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and all but well-capitalized banks are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the FDIA and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash divid ends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At December 31, 2021, SBNA met the criteria to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks. Under the final rule, firms' supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the SCB requirement, replacing the 2.5% of the RWA component under the prior capital conservation buffer requirement. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The rule results in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% of CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. In the event a firm falls below its new minimums, the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Firms continue to submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the final rule. 

Liquidity Rules 

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company are required to calculate the LCR monthly. 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company&#8217;s asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR. 

Resolution Planning 

The DFA requires the Company to prepare and update resolution plans. The 165(d) resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no &#8220;extraordinary support&#8221; is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) resolution plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended FDIA rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors&#8217; rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. 

TLAC 

The TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC. 

Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019. 

Volcker Rule 

Section 13 of the BHCA, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibits a &#8220;banking entity&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities. 

Because the term &#8220;banking entity&#8221; includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (including SBNA and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. 

The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. 

In October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule&#8217;s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm&#8217;s trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. 

In July 2020, the joint agencies finalized a rule that revised the Volcker Rule further. The 2020 revisions provide an exemption for activities of qualifying foreign excluded funds, revise the exclusions from the definition of a &#8220;covered fund&#8221;, create new exclusions from the definition of a covered fund, and modify the definition of an ownership interest. The new rule became effective on October 1, 2020, and the Company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule. 

Risk Retention Rule 

The Federal Reserve's final credit risk retention rule generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and complies with these retention requirements. 

Market Risk Rule 

The market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 

A bank is subject to the market risk capi tal rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold and, as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWAs of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the Company's risk-based capital ratios. 

Heightened Standards 

OCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as &#8220;heightened standards.&#8221; The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions between SBNA and affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. 

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area. 

Regulation AB II 

Regulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform. 

CRA 

SBNA is subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. SBNA&#8217;s current CRA rating is "Outstanding." The OCC takes into account SBNA&#8217;s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications SBNA makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. 

Reference Rate Reform 

The March 5, 2021, announcement by the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority confirmed the unavailability of LIBOR rates beyond June 30, 2023 and cessation of one-week and two-month LIBOR by December 31, 2021. ISDA announced these statements are an &#8220;Index Cessation Event&#8221; under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which in turn triggers a &#8220;Spread Adjustment Fixing Date&#8221; under the Bloomberg IBOR Fallback Rate Adjustments Rule Book. As a result, when LIBOR tenors cease and the fallback rates apply, fallbacks for derivatives under ISDA&#8217;s documentation shift to forms of the SOFR plus the fixed spread adjustment. 

The regulatory agencies also confirmed that the March 5, 2021 announcements constitute a &#8220;Benchmark Transition Event&#8221; with respect to all LIBOR settings. 

We hold loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate and that will be impacted by the cessation of LIBOR. Transition away from LIBOR to new reference rates presents legal, financial, reputational, and operational risks to the Company as well as to other participants in the market. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $20 billion of loans and approximately $5 billion of borrowings with LIBOR exposure. We also had approximately $61 billion in notional amounts of derivative contracts with LIBOR exposure. 

Under the guidance of our cross-functional LIBOR transition program, the Company began offering products linked to alternative reference rates and has progressed on remediating existing contracts that use the LIBOR reference rate. We substantially limited originations of new LIBOR-referenced products as of December 1, 2021. On January 1, 2022, we ceased originations of new LIBOR-referenced products that do not fall under 'approved us' categories. Limited exceptions with fallbacks may be granted for limited use of LIBOR in 2022 if clients are unready or unprepared for alternative reference rates. 

We have progressed on the following aspects of the LIBOR transition to date: 

Communications and training 

&#8226; Created and updated employee and customer-facing LIBOR transition web pages 

&#8226; Communicated with clients about the LIBOR transition through existing channels 

&#8226; Launched conduct risk training for client-facing staff members

&#8226; Adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol 

Products 

&#8226; Launched SOFR-referenced products across consumer, commercial, derivatives, and corporate investment channels. 

&#8226; Maintained quarterly LIBOR exposure reporting

&#8226; Created an inventory and plan for remediation of models potentially impacted by the LIBOR cessation 

&#8226; Substantially completed development and validation of models impacted by the transition to alternative reference rates 

&#8226; Started execution on remediation of remaining models 

Accounting and tax 

&#8226; Implemented relevant FASB and IRS guidance 

&#8226; Documented approach to hedging 

Systems 

&#8226; Completed technology systems updates and testing to support alternative reference rates 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

This MD&#38;A is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, accordingly, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. However, the Company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results. Management identified accounting for ALLL and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases, goodwill, and fair value measurements as the Company's most critical accounting estimates, in that they are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results and require management&#8217;s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

ACL and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The Company maintains an ACL for the Company&#8217;s held-for-investment portfolio, excluding those loans measured at fair value 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 

As described in Note 1 and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the ACL is measured using the current expected credit loss model, which is based on information derived from historical experience, current conditions, and prospective information that requires the use of significant judgment by management. The model includes both quantitative and qualitative factors with key inputs from unemployment data, the Housing Price Index, GDP growth rates, and used vehicle index growth rates, along with certain loan level characteristics all used to predict the likelihood of borrower default. Management applies qualitative factors to capture risks not addressed by the key inputs such as temporary or recent unique market disruptions impacting trends in delinquencies and used vehicle prices. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the ACL may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from these assumptions used in making the evaluations. 

The Company generally uses a third-party vendor's consensus baseline macroeconomic scenario for the quantitative estimate and additional positive and negative macroeconomic scenarios to make qualitative adjustments for macroeconomic uncertainty, and considers adjustments to macroeconomic inputs and outputs based on market volatility. The baseline scenario was based on the latest consensus forecasts available which showed an improvement in key variables in the fourth quarter of 2021, including a sharp decrease in unemployment rates (which are a key driver to losses). The unemployment rate and used vehicle price index, which is a measure of wholesale used car price trends, are considered the most significant variables. Using the weighted-average of a range of economic forecast scenarios, we estimated at December 31, 2021 that the unemployment rate is expected to be approximately 4.71% at the end of 2022, with the labor market continuing to recover in 2023. In comparison, at January 1, 2020, management previously estimated the unemployment rate using the weighted-average of our economic forecast scenarios to be 4.65% at the end of 2022. Additionally, the used vehicle index, where a higher number corresponds to a higher used car price at auction, is estimated at December 31, 2021 to be approximately 205 at the end of 2022 compared to our estimate at January 1, 2020 to be approximately 141 at the end of 2022. While the economy has seen significant recovery in recent months, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding overall lifetime loss estimates. The scenarios used are periodically updated over a reasonable and supportable time horizon with weightings assigned by management and approved through established committee governance. 

Under the range of economic forecast scenarios considered, based on applying a 100% weighting to the most negative scenario used, and without considering the impact of corresponding or offsetting qualitative factors that could have a significant impact on the overall ACL, the ACL would have been higher by approximately $1 billion. This range reflects the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses specifically related to the scenarios and weights considered as of December 31, 2021 and does not consider other potential adjustments that could increase or decrease loss estimates calculated using alternative economic scenarios. 

Management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

Valuation of Automotive Lease Assets and Residuals 

The Company has significant investments in vehicles in its operating lease portfolio. In accounting for operating leases, management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease. Residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to four years. At contract inception, the Company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value. This evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internally-generated data that is compared against third-party, independent data for reasonableness. The customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, the Company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. Management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets. 

To account for residual risk, the Company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception. If the estimated realizable value of a leased vehicle subsequently declines below the residual value at contract inception, additional depreciation expense is recorded. Periodically, the Company revises the estimated realizable value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points, and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease. 

The Company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances, such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs. These circumstances could include, for example, a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices (which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles) or pervasive manufacturer defects (which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model). Impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable. The net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the leas e payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition. If our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by DCF. No such impairment was recognized in 2021, 2020, or 2019. 

The Company's depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers management's expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination, which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values. The critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include: (1) estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values, (2) proper identification and estimation of business conditions, (3) our remarketing abilities, and (4) automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals. Expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers related to residual support and risk-sharing agreements, if any. To the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements, the Company's depreciation expense would be negatively impacted. 

If the estimated realizable values of our leased vehicles were to decline 1% below contractual residual values, depreciation expense at SC would increase by approximately $114 million over the remaining life of the current lease portfolio. 

Goodwill 

The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized on a recurring basis, but rather is subject to periodic impairment testing. 

The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on October 1, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As more fully described in Note 23 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As of December 31, 2021, the reporting units with assigned goodwill were CBB, C&#38;I, CRE &#38; VF, CIB, and SC. 

The evaluation of goodwill impairment requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including allocated goodwill. Determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant valuation inputs, assumptions, and estimates. 

The Company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a risk-based capital approach. Certain of the Company's assets are assigned to a Corporate/Other category. These assets are related to the Company's corporate-only programs, such as BOLI, and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit. 

Goodwill impairment testing involves management's judgment, requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value. This is performed using widely-accepted valuation techniques, such as the guideline public company market approach ("market approach") and the income approach (the DCF method). The Company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units. Several factors are taken into account, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections, and market data. The market approach includes earnings and price-to-tangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the Company's reporting units, except SC. 

For the SC reporting unit, a qualitative assessment was deemed to be sufficient and reasonable. The result of this assessment indicated it was probable that the fair value of the SC reporting unit continues to exceed its carrying value and therefore management determined that a full goodwill impairment test was not warranted. For the SC reporting unit, the Company performed a qualitative analysis based primarily on the evaluation of the reporting unit's carrying value in comparison to the value represented by SHUSA's proposal to acquire SC's shares at a price of $41.50 per share as well as the quoted share price as of the impairment test date. 

The DCF method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units' forecasted cash flows, including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts. The discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units' cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model. Significant inputs to this model include a risk-free rate of return, beta (which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit), market equity risk premium, and, in certain cases, additional premium for size and/or unsystematic company-specific risk factors. The Company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. The Company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, so actual results may differ from forecasted results. 

When calculating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach, short and medium-term forecasts incorporated current economic conditions, including the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term cash flow projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments, as well as a long-term rate of return for each reporting unit. 

In 2020, primarily due to the ongoing economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 billion and $0.3 billion in the CBB and C&#38;I reporting units, respectively. The CRE &#38; VF reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 5%. The goodwill allocated to these reporting units is sensitive to impairment as the valuation is highly correlated with forecasted interest rates, credit costs, and other factors. In light of the significant market volatility arising from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to the pandemic from multiple government agencies, in 2020 the Company determined to give only a 25% weighting to the market approach in estimating the second quarter fair value of CBB, C&#38;I, and CRE &#38; VF. The Company continued to analyze implied market multiples to support the valuation under the market approach. 

No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2021. At the conclusion of the annual assessment, it was determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value primarily due to an improvement in the short and medium term economic forecasts. In response to the stabilization of the economy, the Company returned to its pre-pandemic equal weighting of the income and market approach. Additionally, projections on long-term growth rate increased from depressed projections in 2020, resulting in higher fair values under the income approach. To factor in returning market stability, the Company also returned its control premium assumption to 25%, consistent with its pre-2020 valuations. 

All of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units include such items as: 

&#8226; a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate; 

&#8226; an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; 

&#8226; volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes; 

Refer to the Financial Condition, Goodwill section of this MD&#38;A for further details on the Company's goodwill, including the results of management's goodwill impairment analyses. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company uses fair value measurements to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for both measurement and disclosure purposes. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models, and significant assumptions utilized. The Company follows the fair value hierarchy set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value. The Company reviews and modifies, as necessary, the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Accordingly, there may be reclassifications between hierarchy levels due to changes in inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. 

The Company has numerous internal controls in place to ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements, including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurements. Certain valuations are benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available. 

Considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from observable market data used to estimate the Company's Level 2 fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to the Company's internal valuation models used to estimate Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayment speeds, credit losses, recovery rates and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, the Company's estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange.

Commercial 

Commercial loans decreased approximately $2.0 billion, or 5.1%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. This decrease was comprised of a decrease in C&#38;I loans of $1.8 billion due to the forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans, a decrease in Multifamily loans of $819.8 million, and a decrease in CRE of $100.9 million. These changes were offset by an increase in Other commercial of $714.5 million which includes BSI's acquisition of Cr&#233;dit Agricole's global wealth management client assets. 

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased $1.6 billion, or 15.1%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. This decrease was comprised of a decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio of $991.6 million, and a decrease in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio of $621.3 million. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans increased $2.5 billion, or 6.1%, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 . The increase in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in originations, net of securitizations, due to the Company's initiatives to improve our pricing, as well as, our dealer and customer experience, which have increased our competitive position in the market. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs HFI are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of December 31, 2021, 61.5% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. This also includes 7.4% of loans for which no FICO score was available. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score usin g information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

At December 31, 2021, a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate of 15.1% and was purchased from the dealer at a premium of 2.2%. All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed-rate loans. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, SBNA approved and completed purchases of performing personal unsecured loans from third parties with a UPB of approximately $832.8 million. Servicing was retained by the sellers with no future minimum amounts required to be purchased. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans HFI increased from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 by $1.1 billion.

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent for more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $113.9 million and $229.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Potential problem consumer loans amounted to $3.7 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs decreased $92.4 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Commercial NPLs accounted for less than 1% of commercial LHFI at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in commercial NPLs was primarily comprised of a decrease of $75.0 million in the CRE portfolio, a decrease of $37.3 million in the C&#38;I portfolio, and a decrease of $11 million in Other commercial, offset by an increase of $30.9 million in the Multifamily portfolio. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs and amortizing personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. Credit cards are charged off when they are 180 days delinquent or within 60 days after the receipt of notification of the cardholder&#8217;s death or bankruptcy. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio increased by $293.6 million from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 3.4% and 2.9% of total RICs and auto loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate 

The following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively: 

##TABLE_START December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands) Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit NPLs - HFI $ 123,548 &#160; $ 88,310 &#160; $ 74,473 $ 91,606 Total LHFI 5,598,560 &#160; 3,487,234 &#160; 6,590,168 4,108,505 NPLs as a percentage of total LHFI 2.2 &#160; % 2.5 &#160; % 1.1 % 2.2 % ##TABLE_END 

NPLs as a percentage of LHFI in the Residential mortgage portfolio increased year over year due to higher NPLs in 2021 on a decreasing Residential mortgage portfolio. Foreclosures on consumer loans secured by real estate were $41.1 million or 19.4% of non-performing consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2021, compared to $46.2 million or 27.8% of consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2020. 

Delinquencies 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. 

Overall, total delinquencies increased by $91.3 million , or 2.18% , from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, primarily due to past due auto loans. Delinquent balances and nonaccrual balances on mortgages and other consumer loans were lower as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the benefits of government stimulus payments and tax refunds provided to customers. 

TDRs 

TDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal. 

TDRs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and, at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC TDRs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status.

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines, the Company may offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on its RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. The Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. Further, the maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs is eight, while some marine and RV contracts have a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of months have passed since origination. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement. 

In March 2020, the Company began actively working with its borrowers impacted by COVID-19 and provided loan modification programs in accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidelines to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 on modifications. These programs temporarily revised the practices noted above during 2020 and increased the volume of modifications provided to our customers. Effective January 1, 2021 at SC and April 1, 2021 at SBNA, the Company has generally returned to pre-pandemic servicing practices, with the exception of an increased limit on the total months of extensions allowed. As of December 31, 2021, the overall modification volumes were consistent with volumes experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic and the number and dollar amount of active COVID-19 modifications was immaterial. 

##TABLE_START ##TABLE_END

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged-off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged-off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as TDRs are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the Company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of TDRs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded. For loans that are considered collateral-dependent, such as certain bankruptcy modifications, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less its estimated costs to sell. 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality, and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide facts such as changes in unemployment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used vehicle index growth rates, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

Management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

ACL 

There were no significant changes to the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to the rollforward of the ACL in Note 3 to the Condensed C onsolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased from $146.5 million at December 31, 2020 to $104.1 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was due to a $27.9 million decrease on commercial commitments and a $14.4 million decrease on consumer commitments.

GOODWILL 

The Company records the excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed as goodwill. Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill, and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for goodwill impairment. At December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled $2.6 billion and represented 1.6% of total assets and 10.6% of total stockholder's equity. The following table shows goodwill by reporting units at December 31, 2021: 

##TABLE_START (in thousands) CBB C&#38;I CRE &#38; VF CIB SC Total Goodwill at December 31, 2021 $ 297,802 $ 52,198 $ 1,095,071 $ 131,130 $ 1,019,960 $ 2,596,161 ##TABLE_END

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 each year. The Company conducted its most recent annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2021 using generally accepted valuation methods and noted no impairment.. 

For the CBB, C&#38;I, CRE&#38;VF, and CIB reporting unit fair valuation analyses, the Company applied an equal-weighting to the market and income approach. Additionally, for all reporting units, the Company selected a long-term growth rate of 3.0% for use in the income approach discounted cash flow analysis and a 25.0% control premium for the market approach based on the Company's review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable. Other key assumptions by reporting unit included: 

##TABLE_START CBB C&#38;I CRE&#38;VF CIB Projected TBV 1.2x 1.3x 1.6x 1.4x Discount Rate 11.1% 11.7% 11.7% 10.8% ##TABLE_END

The results of the fair value analyses for each of the reporting units exceeded carrying value by more than 10%. 

For the SC reporting unit, the Company performed a qualitative analysis based primarily on the evaluation of the reporting unit's carrying value in comparison to the value represented by SHUSA's proposal to acquire SC's shares at a price of $41.50 per share as well as the quoted share price as of the impairment test date. Based on that analysis, the Company concluded it was not more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit would exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. 

Management continues to monitor changes in financial position and results of operations that would impact each of the reporting units estimated fair value or carrying value on a regular basis. Through the date of this filing, there have been no indicators which would change management's assessment as of October 1, 2021.

BORROWINGS AND OTHER DEBT OBLIGATIONS 

The Company has term loans and lines of credit with Santander and other lenders. SBNA utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management. SBNA also utilizes repurchase agreements, which are short-term obligations collateralized by securities. In addition, SC has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its RICs and operating leases, which are structured secured financings. Total borrowings and other debt obligations at December 31, 2021 were $41.1 billion, compared to $46.4 billion at December 31, 2020. Total borrowings decreased $5.2 billion, primarily due to an overall decrease in SC debt of $3.5 billion and decreases at the Parent Company and SBNA of $1.0 billion and $0.6 billion due to debt maturities and calls and decreases in FHLB advances. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the detail of Borrowings and other debt obligations.

DEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY 

The Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $683.4 million at December 31, 2021 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $87.9 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $771.3 million with respect to jurisdictional netting), compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of $171.2 million at December 31, 2020 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $11.1 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $182.4 million). The $512.2 million increase in net deferred liability for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the Company's 2021 profits. 

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework. 

The Company is subject to the reg ulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, based on SBNA&#8217;s capital calculations, SBNA was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, based on the Company&#8217;s capital calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of Basel III, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit SBNA's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. SBNA must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if SBNA were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company paid cash dividends of zero, $125.0 million, and $400.0 million respectively, to its common stock shareholder. 

The following schedule summarizes the actual capital balances of SHUSA and SBNA at December 31, 2021:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Further changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Company and Bank 

The Company and SBNA have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including SBNA's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

As of December 31, 2021 , SBNA has borrowed $1.0 billion from SHUSA. This transaction eliminates in consolidation. 

SC 

SC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 12 third-party banks, Santander and SHUSA, and through securitizations in the ABS market and third party flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $8.5 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements. SC uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments. 

During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $18.4 billion, including: 

&#8226; securitization on its SDART platform for approximately $8.2 billion; 

&#8226; securitizations on its DRIVE, deeper subprime platform, for approximately $4.3 billion; 

&#8226; lease securitization on its SRT platform for approximately $5.2 billion; and 

&#8226; private amortizing lease facilities for approximately $700 million. 

SC also completed approximately $4.7 billion in asset sales to third parties. 

For information regarding SC's debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

IHC 

SIS has entered into a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA to provide additional capital to the entity for its expanding capital markets program. Given additional liquidity needs from the program that now includes billing and delivery services for debt and equity issuances, the subordinated line with SIS was renegotiated in July 2021 to $750.0 million with an additional liquidity line of $750.0 million to support the new activity. In November 2021, the liquidity line agreement was increased to $4.0 billion. 

At December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding balances on the subordinated loan or the liquidity line. 

BSI's primary sources of liquidity are from customer deposits and deposits from affiliated banks. 

Institutional borrowings 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios, and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. 

Available Liquidity 

As of December 31, 2021, SBNA had approximately $15.0 billion in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $14.7 billion was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and LHFS) and securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $29.4 billion and $23.5 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 36.4% and 31.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, SBNA and BSI had $2.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, in cash held at the FRB. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations.

Cash flows from operating activities 

Net cash flow from operating activities increased by $3.3 billion from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of and collections on LHFS which includes the SC sale of its Bluestem personal lending portfolio. 

Cash flows from investing activities 

Net cash flow from investing activities decreased by $6.1 billion from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in purchases of LHFI and an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements which began in the second quarter of 2021. 

Cash flows from financing activities 

Net cash flow from financing activities increased by $3.5 billion from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements, offset by a decrease in deposits. 

See the SCF for further details on the Company's sources and uses of cash. 

Credit Facilities 

Third-Party Revolving Credit Facilities 

Warehouse Lines 

SC uses warehouse facilities to fund its originations. Each facility specifies the required collateral characteristics, collateral concentrations, credit enhancement, and advance rates. SC's warehouse facilities generally are backed by auto RICs or auto leases. These facilities generally have one- or two-year commitments, staggered maturities and floating interest rates. SC maintains daily and long-term funding forecasts for originations, acquisitions, and other large outflows such as tax payments to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with its liquidity needs. 

SC's warehouse facilities generally have net spread, delinquency, and net loss ratio limits. Generally, these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line; however, for certain of SC's warehouse facilities, delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to its serviced portfolio as a whole. Failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or, in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines, result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurred under one of these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under the agreement, restrict SC's ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement, and/or remove SC as servicer. SC has never had a warehouse facility terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or a failure to meet any covenant. A default under one of these agreements can be enforced only with respect to the impacted warehouse facility. 

SC has one credit facility with seven banks providing an aggregate commitment of $3.5 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler Capital lease financing. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds. 

SC has eight credit facilities with eleven banks providing an aggregate commitment of $7.5 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support core and CCAP loan financing. As of December 31, 2021, there was an outstanding balance of zero on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds. 

Repurchase Agreements 

SC also obtains financing through investment management or repurchase agreements under which it pledges retained subordinate bonds on its own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging up to 365 days. As of December 31, 2021, there was no outstanding balance under any repurchase agreements. 

Related Party Credit Facilities 

The Company provides SC with $0.5 billion of committed revolving credit and $2.5 billion of contingent liquidity that can be drawn on an unsecured basis. The Company also provides SC with $5.4 billion of term financing with maturities ranging from March 2022 to May 2025. These loans eliminate in the consolidation of SHUSA. Santander provides SC with $4.0 billion of unsecured financing with maturities ranging from June 2022 and September 2022. 

Secured Structured Financings 

SC's secured structured financings primarily consist of both public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issues amortizing notes. SC has on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $27.0 billion. 

Deficiency and Debt Forward Flow Agreement 

In addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet, but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing 

Beginning in 2018, SC has agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans, primarily from Stellantis dealers, all of which are serviced by SC. The loans are on the balance sheet of SBNA. 

SC also continues to periodically execute securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. After retaining the required credit risk retention via a 5% vertical interest, SC transfers all remaining notes and residual interests in these securitizations to third parties. SC subsequently records these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removes the sold assets from its Consolidated Balance Sheets if it qualifies as a transfer of financial assets under the accounting guidance. 

Uses of Liquidity 

The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests. SIS uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions, as well as billing and delivery services. The primary use of liquidity for BSI is to meet customer liquidity requirements, such as maturing deposits, investment activities, funds transfers, and payment of operating expenses. 

At December 31, 2021, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months. 

Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 

The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset/liability management and to meet required capital needs. These obligations require the Company to make cash payments over time. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total contractual cash obligations of $52.2 billion which included FHLB advances, notes payables, other debt obligations, CDs, repurchase agreements, non-qualified pension and post-retirement benefits, and operating leases. Of this amount, $13.5 billion of the total contractual cash obligations is due within one year. In addition, the Company had other commitments of $29.0 billion which consisted of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Of this amount, $7.8 billion of the other commitments is due within one year. 

The Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 14 and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Divid ends, Contributions and Stock Issuances 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding. 

On March 31, 2021, SC paid a cash dividend of $0.22 per share and a special dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock for a total of $0.44 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2021. SC also paid a dividend of $0.22 per share in May 2021 and August 2021. SC paid a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock to shareholders in December 2021. 

SC has paid a total of $336.7 million in dividends through December 31, 2021, of which $66.5 million has been paid to NCI and $270.2 million has been paid to the Company, which eliminates in the consolidated results of the Company. 

In August 2021, SHUSA entered into a definitive agreement whereby SHUSA agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of SC Common Stock not already owned by SHUSA via an all-cash tender offer. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHUSA commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of SC Common Stock that SHUSA does not already own at a price of $41.50 per share in cash. SHUSA agreed to acquire all remaining shares not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same price as in the tender offer. Consummation of the tender offer was subject to various conditions, including regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve and other customary closing conditions. The transaction was completed on January 31, 2022, at which time, SHUSA acquired the remaining 19.8% noncontrolling interest in SC for approximately $2.5 billion, and SC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHUSA. For additional information, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Share Repurchases 

In June 2019, SC announced that the SC Board of Directors had authorized purchases by SC of up to $1.1 billion, excluding commissions, of its outstanding common stock effective from the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, SC purchased shares of SC Common Stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer, and extended the share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter of 2020. 

During 2020, SC announced that the Company&#8217;s request for certain exceptions to the Interim Policy prohibiting share repurchases (other than repurchases relating to issuances of common stock under employee stock ownership plans) and limiting dividends paid by certain CCAR institutions to the average trailing four quarters' of net income, had been approved. Such exception approval permitted SC to continue its share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter of 2020. On August 10, 2020, SC announced that it had substantially exhausted the amount of shares SC was permitted to repurchase under the exception approval, and that SC expected to repurchase an immaterial number of shares remaining under the exception approval. 

After substantially exhausting its share repurchase authorization on August 10, 2020 and through the end of the second quarter of 2021, SC was only permitted to repurchase a number of shares of SC Common Stock equal to the amount of share issuances related to SC&#8217;s expensed employee compensation.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month LIBOR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing. 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

##TABLE_START The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to net interest income would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Down 100 basis points (2.63) % (1.12) % Up 100 basis points 4.33 &#160; % 3.18 % Up 200 basis points 8.17 &#160; % 6.25 % ##TABLE_END

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

##TABLE_START The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to MVE would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Down 100 basis points (3.18) % (6.18) % Up 100 basis points (0.91) % 1.62 % Up 200 basis points (3.71) % 0.51 % ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2021, the Company&#8217;s profile reflected a decrease of MVE of 3.18% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and a decrease of 0.91% for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between up 100 and down 100 shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMDs. 

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. 

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

Through the Company&#8217;s capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, SBNA originates residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales. 

For additional information on foreign exchange contracts, derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

The Company's non-GAAP information has limitations as an analytical tool and, therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under GAAP as set forth in the Company's financial statements. These limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the Company's GAAP results and using this non-GAAP information only as a supplement to evaluate the Company's performance. 

The Company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Company believes that there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these ratios. These ratios are not formally defined by GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Company's capital adequacy using these ratios, the Company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the Company's capitalization to other organizations. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Company's calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following table includes the related GAAP measures included in our non-GAAP financial measures.

2021 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS 

SHUSA reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $705.2 million compared to net income of $856.7 million for the third quarter of 2021. The most significant contributors to the decrease were a decrease in interest income of $39.6 million, attributable primarily to lower interest income on loans, and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $106.5 million, primarily related to true up of year end compensation and benefit expense and higher technology, outside services, and marketing expense.
