 ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association; SC, a consumer finance company headquartered in Dallas, Texas; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami, Florida that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SanCap, an institutional broker-dealer headquartered in New York, which has significant capabilities in market making via an experienced fixed-income sales and trading team and a focus on structuring and advisory services for asset originators in the real estate and specialty finance markets; SSLLC, a broker-dealer headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts; and several other subsidiaries. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston and SBNA's home office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SSLLC is a registered investment adviser with the SEC. SHUSA's two largest subsidiaries by asset size and revenue are SBNA and SC. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. 

The Company specializes in consumer financing focused on vehicle finance, servicing of third-party vehicle financing, and delivering service to dealers and customers across the full credit spectrum. This includes indirect origination and servicing of vehicle loans and leases, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers, origination of vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases of vehicle loans from other lenders, and servicing of automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. The Company sells consumer vehicle loans and leases through flow agreements and, when market conditions are favorable, it accesses the ABS market through securitizations of consumer vehicle loans and leases. 

Since May 2013, under the MPLFA with Stellantis, the Company has operated as Stellantis' preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to Stellantis customers and dealers under the CCAP brand. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company announced it had reached an agreement with Stellantis to amend and extend the MPLFA through December 2025. In June 2022, the Company launched a preferred lender, full spectrum financing program in partnership with MMNA to provide customer and dealer financing programs that will help MMNA achieve its goal of improving the car-buying experience. 

In addition to specialized consumer finance, the Company also attracts deposits and provides other retail banking services through its network of retail branches with locations in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island and originates small business, middle market, large and global commercial loans, multifamily loans, and other consumer loans and leases throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern areas of the United States. For large institutional investors, the Company provides structured products, emerging markets credit and U.S. investment grade credit, U.S. rates, short-term fixed-income, debt and equity capital markets, investment banking, exchange traded derivatives, and cash equities, benefiting from a combination of Santander&#8217;s global reach and access to financial hubs together with extensive local market knowledge and regional expertise. 

The Company uses its deposits, public and private borrowings, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Overview 

The unemployment rate at June 30, 2023 was 3.6% compared to 3.5% at March 31, 2023 and 3.6% one year ago. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment continued to trend up in government, health care, social assistance, and construction. 

Market year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices for the period indicated were: 

June 30, 2023 Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.8% S&#38;P 500 15.9% NASDAQ Composite 31.7% 

At its June 2023 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee maintained the federal funds rate target range of 5.00% - 5.25%. The FOMC continues to focus its policy making on maximum employment and a 2.0% inflation target rate. 

The ten-year Treasury bond rate at June 30, 2023 was 3.82%, down from 3.88% at December 31, 2022. 

One of the primary metrics used by the market to monitor the strength of the used car market is the Manheim Used Vehicle Index. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, based on the 1997 Manheim- based index, decreased from 219.3 at December 31, 2022 to 215.1 at June 30, 2023. 

Recent Events Affecting the Financial Services Industry 

In response to the current interest rate environment and recent events affecting the financial services industry, the Company has enhanced its monitoring of interest rate and liquidity risks. Additional information related to these matters can be found in the sections of this MD&#38;A titled Deposits, Bank Regulatory Capital, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Asset and Liability Management. 

The recent failure of several large U.S. banking institutions has led to increased market uncertainty. The Company was not materially impacted by these events during the quarter; however, changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. These factors will likely increase competition and pricing on customer deposits over the short and medium term, heighten market and regulatory focus and reform on liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk, and will likely result in a special assessment on banks to cover losses to the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund which we estimate to be approximately $60 million in total and paid quarterly over the next two years beginning in the first quarter of 2024. These changing market conditions and uncertainty will likely present challenges in the growth of net interest income, increased credit risk and associated credit loss expense, and could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations. It is not possible to quantify the impact of changing market conditions, uncertainty, or regulatory action on the Company's results of operations. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Credit Rating Actions 

The following table presents Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch credit ratings for SBNA, SHUSA, and Santander senior debt / long-term issuer: 

SANTANDER (1) 

SHUSA SBNA (2) 

Overall Outlook Fitch A / A- BBB+ BBB+ Stable Moody's A2 / Baa1 Baa3 Baa1 Stable S&#38;P A+ / A- BBB+ A- Stable 

(1) Senior preferred debt / Senior non-preferred rating 

(2) Moody's rating represents SBNA long-term issuer rating 

SHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely relat ed to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA. 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

The activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including SBNA and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent, Santander. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's subsidiaries are further supervised by the OCC, the FRB of Atlanta, and the New York Department of Financial Services. 

The Federal Reserve tailors its supervisory programs and regulatory requirements by category based on firm-specific characteristics such as total assets, cross-jurisdictional activity, and nonbank asset or off-balance sheet exposure. As of June 30, 2023, SHUSA is designated a Category IV institution under the Federal Reserve's tailoring rule. Institutions that change to a higher category would become subject to the requirements of the new category, as outlined by the Federal Reserve, generally within two quarters of the change in category. 

Payment of Divid ends 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and SBNA. 

These rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations, including the Company and SBNA, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios is required for banking institutions to make capital distributions, including paying dividends. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

As described in Note 1 to these Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL standard, which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance, net of income tax, and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2.5 billion. The U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations, including the Company, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. On March 26, 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. SHUSA remains in the three-year transition period. This interim rule was subsequently updated with technical amendments in a final rule dated September 30, 2020 which was elected by the Company. 

See the "Bank Regulatory Capital" section of this MD&#38;A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company. 

Material restrictions can be imposed on SBNA, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically under-capitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically under-capitalized banks generally may not make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and all but well-capitalized banks are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the FDIA and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At June 30, 2023, SBNA met the criteria to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks. Under the final rule, firms' supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the SCB requirement. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The rule results in new firm-specific regulatory capital expectations which are equal to 4.5% of CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. In the event a firm falls below its new minimums, the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Firms continue to submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the final rule. As of June 30, 2023, SHUSA's CET1 minimum requirement was 8.2% and will decline to 7.0% on October 1, 2023. 

Revisions to regulatory capital rules are in progress. On July 27, 2023, the regulatory agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) which includes proposed changes to regulatory capital and RWA calculations. The proposed rules and their impact on SHUSA are under review. 

Liquidity Rules 

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (but with more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company are required to calculate the LCR monthly. 

Resolution Planning 

The DFA requires the Company to prepare and update resolution plans. The 165(d) resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no &#8220;extraordinary support&#8221; is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) resolution plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in June 2022. In addition, under amended FDIA rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors&#8217; rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

TLAC 

The TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC. 

Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. 

Volcker Rule 

Section 13 of the BHCA, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibits a &#8220;banking entity&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities. 

Because the term &#8220;banking entity&#8221; includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (including SBNA and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. 

The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, and testing and auditing for compliance. 

Risk Retention Rule 

The Federal Reserve's final credit risk retention rule generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and complies with these retention requirements. 

Market Risk Rule 

The market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal risk-based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk-based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 

A bank is subject to the market risk capi tal rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or m ore. the Bank and the Company are required to comply with the market risk component within RWAs of the risk-based capital ratios, and submit the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report. 

SHUSA is integrating SanCap's products, models and infrastructure into SHUSA&#8217;s U.S. market risk rule program, which is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Until the integration is completed and SanCap&#8217;s models are in compliance with the U.S. market risk rule, SHUSA is required to include and report market risk RWAs as of June 30, 2023 utilizing the approaches available in the U.S. market risk rule. Assuming a consistent balance of assets, the Company expects market risk RWAs to decrease as the models are fully implemented. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Heightened Standards 

OCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as &#8220;heightened standards.&#8221; The heightened standards apply to insured national banks, like SBNA, with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions between SBNA and affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. 

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area. 

Regulation AB II 

Regulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform. 

CRA 

SBNA is subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. SBNA&#8217;s current CRA rating is "Outstanding." The OCC takes into account SBNA&#8217;s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications SBNA makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. 

Broker-Dealer Regulation 

The Broker-Dealers are registered with the SEC and subject to the regulation of the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, CME, and the NFA. These entities are subject to the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital levels. In addition, these entities are required to maintain proper controls over customer funds and securities and ensure that customer assets are not used for the benefit of the Broker-Dealer. These requirements also restrict the Broker-Dealer&#8217;s ability to withdraw capital. Prior written notification to and approval from the applicable regulators is required for withdrawals exceeding 30 percent of the Broker-Dealer&#8217;s excess net capital and also where the Broker-Dealer&#8217;s net capital would be less than 25 percent of deductions from its net worth in computing net capital. 

Edge Act Corporation Requirements 

Edge Act corporations such as BSI are chartered under Section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act. These entities are subject to specific regulatory requirements under Regulation K. Permissible activities of Edge Act and agreement corporations include those incidental to international or foreign business. Deposit-taking, credit, and fiduciary and investment advisor services are subject to applicable Federal Reserve regulations. Edge Act corporations are also subject to the USA Patriot Act as well as all applicable laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Reference Rate Reform 

The US dollar LIBOR reference rate panel ceased publication of LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023. Although 1-, 3-, and 6-month LIBOR settings continue to be published in synthetic form, these rates are not representative of the markets and, as a result, are not generally used unless required by the underlying contract. Under the guidance of our cross-functional LIBOR transition program, the Company offered products linked to alternative reference rates and remediated existing contracts that used LIBOR reference rates. On December 1, 2022, we ceased originations of new LIBOR-referenced products that do not fall under 'approved use' categories. 

The Company continues to hold loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments that used a LIBOR reference rate fixed prior to cessation. These facilities will move to alternative rates at the time of their next contractual rate reset. Transition away from LIBOR to new reference rates presents legal, financial, reputational, and operational risks to the Company as well as to other participants in the market. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $4 billion of loans with LIBOR exposure. We also had approximately $26 billion in notional amounts of derivative contracts with LIBOR exposure. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company has largely completed its LIBOR-to-SOFR transition program. The Company significantly reduced LIBOR exposure by continuing to actively transition clients to SOFR in the second quarter of 2023. Remaining LIBOR loans and derivatives bearing interest based on LIBOR have agreed upon fallback amendments or direct-to-SOFR agreements or notices, or other established means of transition, which will effect a change to alternative rates upon the next contractual rate reset date. For those clients who have not responded to the Company or were uncooperative in agreeing to contract transition agreements, the Company utilized provisions in the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act to move their loan and derivative contracts to alternative rates with credit spreads as set by that Act.

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income decreased $42.1 million and decreased $11.8 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The most significant factors contributing to these changes were as follows: 

&#8226; Interest income on loans increased $368.6 million and increased $704.9 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The three month period change is attributed to an increase in average loan volume of $116.4 million and an increase in average rates of $252.2 million. The six month period change is attributed to an increase in average loan volume of $240.5 million and an increase in average rates of $464.3 million. Refer to the discussion of changes in loan balances in the "Loan Portfolio" section of this MD&#38;A. The increases are also attributed to interest rate increases. 

&#8226; Interest income on interest-earning deposits increased $168.1 million and increased $314.4 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The three month period change is attributed to a decrease in average interest-bearing deposits volume of $1.8 million and an increase in average rates of $169.9 million. The six month period change is attributed to a decrease in average interest-bearing deposits volume of $7.1 million and an increase in average rates of $321.5 million. These changes are primarily driven by the changing interest rate environment. 

&#8226; Interest and fees on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements increased $612.5 million and increased $1.1 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The three month period change is attributed to an increase in average federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements volume of $8.6 million and an increase in average rates of $603.9 million. The six month period change is attributed to a decrease in average federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangement volume of $1.6 million and an increase in average rates of $1.1 billion. These changes are primarily due to increased Securities Financing Activities following the acquisition of PCH during 2022. 

&#8226; Interest income on investment securities increased $115.0 million and increased $242.0 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The three month period change is attributed to an increase in average investment securities volume of $40.3 million and an increase in average rates of $74.7 million. The six month period change is attributed to an increase in average investment securities volume of $38.5 million and an increase in average rates of $203.5 million. These changes are primarily driven by an increase in interest rates during the year. 

&#8226; Interest expense on deposits and related customer accounts increased $327.6 million and increased $599.4 million for the three months and six months June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The three month period change is attributed to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit volume of $73.3 million and an increase in average rates of $254.2 million. The six month period change is attributed to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit volume of $129.6 million and an increase in average rates of $469.9 million. The increase in average rates is primarily attributed to money market and CD products. 

&#8226; Interest expense on Securities Financing Activities and borrowed funds increase $978.8 million and increased $1.8 billion for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The three month period change is attributed to an increase in average Securities Financing Activities and borrowed funds volume of $73.2 million and an increase in average rates of $905.6 million. The six month period change is attributed to an increase in average Securities Financing Activities and borrowed funds volume of $119.5 million and an increase in average rates of $1.7 billion. Both changes were mostly attributed to an increase in Securities Financing Activities. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

CREDIT LOSS EXPENSE (BENEFIT) 

The Company had credit loss expense of $208.9 million and $751.3 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to a credit loss expense of $404.2 million and $621.0 million for the corresponding periods in 2022. The credit loss expense during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023 was mainly due to RICs charge-offs which continue to normalize. 

Credit loss expense on commercial loans decreased $4.3 million and increased $28.6 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic outlook for the CRE portfolio and other factors such as rising interest rates and persistent inflation. 

Credit loss expense on consumer loans decreased $196.3 million and increased $83.6 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in RIC charge-offs and deterioration in personal unsecured lending portfolios, partially offset by the release of the allowance driven by Auto and an increase in recoveries. Net charge-offs on the consumer loan portfolios increased $123.6 million and $291.1 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, as current year activity reflects normalization in credit performance as delinquencies have started to return to the pre- COVID-19 pandemic levels and repossession activity increased compared to 2022. 

The credit loss expense on unfunded credit losses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023 increased $5.2 million and $18.1 million, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022.

Total non-interest income decreased $36.0 million and $117.0 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. These changes were primarily due to: 

&#8226; a decrease in lease income of $58.1 million and $100.9 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, primarily due to lower operating lease volume; 

&#8226; an increase in net gains recognized in earnings of $23.8 million and $46.8 million for three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, primarily due to an increase in securitized products; 

&#8226; a decrease in miscellaneous income, net of $22.4 million and $48.8 million, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022 discussed further below.

Miscellaneous income decreased $22.4 million and $48.8 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The decreases for both periods were primarily due to a decrease in management fee income and miscellaneous fee income, offset by an increase in equity method investments income.

Total general, administrative and other expenses increased $24.0 million and $100.5 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. The most significant contributing factors were as follows: 

&#8226; Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $24.3 million and $42.5 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, primarily related to the Company's transformation initiatives. 

&#8226; Loan expense increased $20.2 million and $59.1 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022, due to increasing auto loan servicing costs. 

INCOME TAX PROVISION 

Income tax expense of $64.6 million and $92.8 million were recorded for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to $107.0 million and $268.7 million for the corresponding periods in 2022. This resulted in an ETR of 10.1% and 9.6% for three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 19.6% and 20.3% for the corresponding periods in 2022. The decrease in the Company&#8217;s ETR from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023 is primarily the result of a decrease in expected pre-tax income for 2023 compared to 2022 coupled with an expected increase in electric vehicle and other general business tax credits in 2023, which reduce the ETR. 

The Company's ETR in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Company's interpretations by tax authorities that examine tax returns filed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

The Company reported total income before income taxes related to its Consumer activities of $655.5 million and $971.5 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to income before income taxes of $529.7 million and $1.3 billion for the corresponding periods in 2022. The most significant drivers of these changes were: 

&#8226; Net interest income for Auto decreased $113.3 million and decreased $244.3 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2022. These changes were primarily due to higher interest expense on borrowings partially offset by higher loan volume and slightly higher yields on new originations. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense in Auto decreased $238.3 million and decreased $41.1 million or the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. This improvement was driven by lower ACL build due to macroeconomic scenario improvements; delinquency normalization continues however still lower to pre-pandemic levels. 

&#8226; Net interest income for CBB increased $80.4 million and increased $178.7 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. These changes were primarily driven by increased loan balances and improved deposit FTP. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense for CBB increased $39.4 million and increased $141.5 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. These increases were driven by higher reserve builds and normalization of delinquency.

The Company reported total income before income taxes related to its Commercial activities of $107.6 million and $187.6 million, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively compared to income before income taxes of $70.1 million and $162.0 million for the corresponding periods in 2022. The most significant drivers of these changes were: 

&#8226; Total assets in C&#38;I June 30, 2023 decreased $1.1 billion compared to the corresponding period of 2022. These decreases were driven by strategic asset sales. 

&#8226; Net interest income in CRE increased $28.2 million and increased $54.9 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2022. The increase was driven by a higher rate environment and higher loan balances. 

&#8226; Credit loss expense in CRE increased $21.1 million and increased $70.9 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2022. These increases were driven by increased reserves due in part to the volume growth in the CRE and multifamily businesses and in part due to the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook. 

&#8226; Total assets in CRE at June 30, 2023 increased $3.9 billion compared to the corresponding period of 2022. These increases were driven by our strategy to grow our higher-return financing projects as part of our national expansion initiative in the multifamily business. Along with higher originations, we have also seen much lower prepayments since rates began to rise in the first half of 2022.

&#8226; Net interest income increased $13.5 million and increased $47.4 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2022. These increases were due in part to the acquisition of PCH in the second quarter of 2022.

The primary factor contributing to these changes were: 

&#8226; Net interest income decreased $82.9 million and decreased $146.2 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2022. These decreases were mainly due to increased cost of funding from the FHLB and brokered deposits. 

&#8226; Total expenses increased $39.6 million and increased $58.8 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods of 2022. These increases were a result of transformation initiatives underway at the Bank.

Commercial 

Commercial loans increased approximately $0.6 billion, or 1.4% from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributed to an increase in Multifamily loans of $1.2 billion, an increase in CRE loans of $513.4 million offset by a decrease in C&#38;I loans of $792.4 million. 

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased $495.7 million, from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from the Company&#8217;s decision to stop the origination of new residential mortgage and home equity loans in the first quarter of 2022. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans decreased $0.3 billion from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. The decrease in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to decreases in originations, net of securitizations. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs HFI are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

As of June 30, 2023, 59.0% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. This also includes 6.3% of loans for which no FICO score was available. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because of the historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans HFI increased $636.4 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. This increase was comprised of a $502.5 million increase in new loan originations, offset by payoffs and paydowns. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

At June 30, 2023, the CRE and multifamily portfolios included the following: 

As of June 30, 2023 

(in thousands) Balance Percentage of Total CRE and Multifamily CRE loans $ 8,484,720 43.9 %

Multifamily lending (occupied and construction) represents 69% of the total CRE and multifamily portfolio and 14% of total LHFI. Occupancy across the multifamily loan portfolio remained high and rents remained strong across all of our markets through June 30, 2023, although rent increases started to de-accelerate from their early 2022 peaks. Our multifamily portfolio is primarily in key markets such as New York City. Our construction originations are concentrated to well-established and proven builders and sponsors. 

Office CRE loans represent 10.3% of the total CRE and multifamily portfolio and 2% of total LHFI. The Company's office exposure primarily consists of investment grade, single tenants with long leases. As a result, the Company's occupancy in office CRE loans is higher when compared with the industry average. 

The Company's retail CRE portfolio represents 6.5% of the total CRE and multifamily portfolio and 1% of total LHFI. The retail portfolio is anchored by pharmacies and high-end grocery stores, which have demonstrated recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.

(1) Annualized net loan charge-offs are based on year to date charge-offs. 

Commercial net charge-offs during the period to average loans increased from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily due to deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and higher volume in the portfolio. Consumer net charge-offs during the period to average loans increased from June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to charge-offs normalizing to pre-COVID periods and an increase in repossession activity compared to 2022. 

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs increased $38.7 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. Commercial NPLs accounted for less than 1% of commercial LHFI at June 30, 2023. The change in commercial NPLs was primarily comprised of a decrease of $16.7 million in the multifamily portfolio, a decrease of $15.3 million in the CRE portfolio and an increase of $70.6 million in the C&#38;I portfolio. 

Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate 

NPLs in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased year-over-year primarily resulting from the Company&#8217;s decision to stop the origination of new residential mortgage and home equity loans in the first quarter of 2022. Foreclosures on consumer loans secured by real estate were $69.8 million or 46.0% of non-performing consumer loans secured by real estate at June 30, 2023, compared to $75.2 million or 47.5% of consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2022. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs 

RICs are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio decreased by $211.7 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 4.0% and 4.5% of total RICs and auto loans at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Personal unsecured loans 

The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. Credit cards are charged off when they are 180 days delinquent or within 60 days after the receipt of notification of the cardholder&#8217;s death or bankruptcy. NPLs in the personal unsecured portfolio increased by $5.2 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. Non-performing personal 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

unsecured loans accounted for 0.3% and 0.3% of total personal unsecured loans at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 

Delinquencies 

Early stage delinquency in commercial loans totaled approximately $218.5 million and $111.2 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Early stage delinquency consumer loans amounted to $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Management has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods. 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. Overall, total delinquencies decreased by $54.3 million from December 31, 2022 to June 30, 2023. The main driver of this is the decrease in past due auto loans in early stages of delinquency due to seasonal improvement in payment performance and credit normalization. 

Loan Modifications 

Loan modifications occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. In these cases, the Company agrees to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, covenant waivers and deferments of principal. 

Modified loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, modified loans may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC modifications are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and, at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC modifications are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status. 

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged-off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged-off, historical charge-off ratios, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as modified are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02. This guidance removes the specific accounting and disclosure guidance for TDR designations and enhances disclosure requirements related to modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2023 on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. The effect of this implementation was an increase in the ACL of approximately $55.2 million, a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $41.4 million and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of approximately $13.8 million. Refer to Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on modified loans. 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality, and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide factors such as changes in unemployment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used vehicle index, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

Management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

ACL 

The Company's ACL was $6.8 billion at June 30, 2023, a decrease of $47.0 million from December 31, 2022. The decrease in the ACL was primarily driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook for certain macro variables such as unemployment rate and used vehicle price index, partially offset by a deterioration in the personal unsecured lending portfolio and in the macroeconomic outlook of the CRE portfolio. The ACL for the consumer segment decreased by $65.7 million, and the ACL for the commercial segment increased $18.8 million for the period ended June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. Refer to the rollforward of the ACL in Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased from $85.6 million at December 31, 2022 to $85.7 million at June 30, 2023.

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital for a range of macroeconomic outcomes. 

The Company is subject to the regulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, based on SBNA&#8217;s capital calculations, SBNA was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, based on the Company&#8217;s capital calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of U.S. Basel III, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit SBNA's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. SBNA must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, (3) the Bank has negative retained earnings, or (4) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if SBNA were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. Refer to the section captioned "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&#38;A for discussion of the Company's dividends. 

The following schedule summarizes the actual capital ratios of SHUSA and SBNA at June 30, 2023: 

SHUSA June 30, 2023 Well-capitalized Requirement Minimum Requirement CET1 capital ratio 12.80 &#160; % 6.50 % 4.50 % Tier 1 capital ratio 14.19 &#160; % 8.00 % 6.00 % Total capital ratio 16.21 &#160; % 10.00 % 8.00 % Leverage ratio 9.96 &#160; % 5.00 % 4.00 %

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Enhanced Monitoring of Liquidity 

In addition to its normal monitoring of liquidity, SBNA has enhanced monitoring of its liquidity position since the recent financial system market disruption that began in March 2023 and the ensuing market volatility. Additionally, SBNA continues to improve and optimize contingent sources of liquidity. Some of these actions in the second quarter of 2023 include the pledge of additional loans to the Discount Window, the transfer of securities from the Discount Window to the BTFP and the transfer of loans from the Discount Window to the FHLB in order to receive more favorable haircuts. Overall, the available capacity from the FRB and FHLB increased by approximately $8.5 billion and $975 million, respectively, over the quarter. 

Impact of Changes to Credit Rating on Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Company has several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including the core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

The specialized consumer financing of RICs requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. The Company funds these operations through its lending relationships with third-party banks, Santander and affiliates, and through securitizations in the ABS market. The Company seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments. 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company's subsidiaries completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $3.1 billion, including: 

&#8226; securitization on its SDART platform for approximately $1.0 billion; and 

&#8226; lease securitizations on its SCARF platform for approximately $2.1 billion. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company's subsidiaries issued $131.6 million of credit-linked notes due February 2052 and $115.5 million of credit-linked notes due June 2029. The notes contain a financial guarantee on a reference pool of mortgage loans and auto loans, respectively, owned by the Company. For information regarding the Company's and its subsidiaries' debt, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Intercompany Borrowings with SHUSA affiliates 

SanCap has a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA to provide additional capital to the entity for its capital markets program. Given additional liquidity needs from the program that now includes billing and delivery services for debt and equity issuances, the subordinated line with SanCap is $750.0 million with an additional liquidity line of $4.0 billion. At June 30, 2023, there were no outstanding balances on the subordinated loan or the liquidity line. In addition, SanCap has entered into a loan agreement with SHUSA to provide an additional liquidity buffer. 

Available Liquidity 

As of the periods indicated, the Company and its subsidiaries had the following available liquidity:

(1) Includes high quality liquid assets that are encumbered as collateral for uninsured government deposits. 

At June 30, 2023, unencumbered highly liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and investments in debt securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $22.5 billion. This amount represented 28.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2023. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations under business-as-usual and stress conditions. Liquidity from unencumbered securities decreased from March 31, 2023 to June 30, 2023 due to additional pledges of collateral to FRB.

Cash flows from operating activities 

Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by $2.0 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the change in net trading activity during the six months ended June 30, 2023, resulting from the acquisition of PCH in the second quarter of 2022. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Cash flows from investing activities 

Net cash flow from investing activities increased by $0.6 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to less purchases of AFS investments and purchases of loans held for investment, offset by decreases in proceeds from prepayments and maturities of AFS investments and proceeds from the sales and terminations of operating leases. 

Cash flows from financing activities 

Net cash flow from financing activities increased by $13.1 billion from the six months ended June 30, 2022 to the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in cash inflows related to Securities Financing Activities, deposit increases during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to decreases in the corresponding period in the prior year, as well as cash outflows during the six months ended June 30, 2022 related to the repurchase of the remaining outstanding shares of SC.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month term SOFR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Several assumptions and models are used to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions, and competitor pricing. Certain models use historical data analyses to estimate future customer behavior, such as deposit re-pricing and attrition. Estimates from these models can differ from actual behavior, depending on various factors such as macroeconomic conditions, competitor response, etc.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These various scenarios include parallel, non-parallel, gradual parallel and gradual non-parallel rate shocks applied relative to the implied market-based forward curve, as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four measures of risk described above. The shocks below are extended using the parallel scenario and are applied instantaneously to the implied forward curve as of the stated month-end. The down 200 basis point shock has been added as market rates have increased. This set of shocks represents a range of plausible rate shocks, as an instantaneous shock down 200 basis points can be analogous to a gradual ramp-down of 400 basis points over one year. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to net interest income would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Down 200 basis points (5.16) % (4.99) % Down 100 basis points (2.47) % (2.38) % Up 100 basis points 2.43 &#160; % 2.32 % Up 200 basis points 4.85 &#160; % 4.60 % 

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to MVE would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Down 200 basis points 4.83 &#160; % 4.52 % Down 100 basis points 3.14 &#160; % 3.09 % Up 100 basis points (3.60) % (3.70) % Up 200 basis points (7.15) % (7.40) % 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s profile reflected an increase of MVE of 3.14% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and a decrease of 3.60% for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between a 100 basis point increase and a 100 basis point decrease is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMDs.

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. 

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

The Company is subject to price risk through its capital markets and mortgage banking activities. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales.
