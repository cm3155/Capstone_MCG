ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA, a national banking association; SC, a consumer finance company headquartered in Dallas, Texas; SSLLC, a broker-dealer headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts; BSI, a financial services company headquartered in Miami, Florida that offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; SIS, a registered broker-dealer headquartered in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; SFS, a consumer credit institution headquartered in Puerto Rico; and several other subsidiaries. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and SB NA's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SSLLC and SIS and another SHUSA subsidiary, SAM, are registered investment advisers with the SEC. SHUSA's two largest subsidiaries by asset size and revenue are SBNA and SC. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Santander. 

As of September 30, 2021, SC was ow ned approximately 80.2% by SHUSA and 19.8% by othe r shareholders. SC Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol "SC." Refer to Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on SHUSA's proposal to acquire the remainder of SC's outstanding shares. 

SBNA's primary business consists of attracting deposits and providing other retail banking services through its network of retail branches, and originating small business loans, middle market, large and global commercial loans, multifamily loans, residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, and auto and other consumer loans throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern areas of the United States, principally located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. SBNA uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. SBNA earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, SBNA generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and BOLI. SBNA's principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The financial results of SBNA are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within SBNA's geographic footprint. 

SC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing and delivering service to dealers and customers across the full credit spectrum. SC's primary business is the indirect origination and servicing of RICs and auto leases, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. Additionally, SC sells consumer RICs through flow agreements and, when market conditions are favorable, it accesses the ABS market through securitizations of consumer RICs. SAF is SC&#8217;s primary vehicle financing brand, and is available as a finance option for automotive dealers across the United States Further information about SC&#8217;s business is provided below in the &#8220;CCAP&#8221; section. 

SC is managed through a single reporting segment which includes vehicle financial products and services, including RICs, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to recreational and marine vehicles and other consumer finance products. 

SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has other relationships through which it holds other consumer finance products. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

CCAP 

Since May 2013, under the MPLFA with Stellantis, the Company has operated as Stellantis's preferred provider for consumer loans, leases and dealer loans and provides services to Stellantis customers and dealers under the CCAP brand. The Company's average penetration rate under the MPLFA for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 was 27%, a decrease from 33% for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2020. 

SC has dedicated financing facilities in place for its CCAP business and has pursued a strategy of working collaboratively with Stellantis to continue to strengthen their relationship and create value within the CCAP program. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021, SC originated $11.1 billion in CCAP loans, which represented 53% of the UPB of its total RIC originations, as well as $5.8 billion in CCAP leases. Additionally, all of the leases originated by SC during nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 were under the MPLFA. 

ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

Overview 

The unemployment rate at September 30, 2021 was 4.8% compared to 5.9% at June 30, 2021 and 7.9% one year ago, which represented an improvement off the April 2020 peak of unemployment associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the improvement from March 2021 reflects the continuing resumption of economic activity, particularly in the leisure and hospitality, public and private education, professional and business services, retail trade and other services. 

Market year-to-date returns for the following indices based on closing prices at September 30, 2021 were: 

September 30, 2021 Dow Jones Industrial Average 10.6% S&#38;P 500 14.7% NASDAQ Composite 12.1% 

In light of the effects the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have on economic activity, at its September 2021 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 0.00% to 0.25%. The Committee expects to maintain this target rate until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation to remain at the targeted rate of 2.0% . 

The ten-year Treasury bond rate at September 30, 2021 was 1.53% , up from 0.92% at December 31, 2020. Within the industry, changes in this metric are often considered to correspond to changes in 15-year and 30-year mortgage rates. 

Changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the Company. The interest rate environment can present challenges in the growth of net interest income for the banking industry, which continues to rely on non-interest activities to support revenue growth. Changing market conditions and political uncertainty could have an overall impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impact the Company's credit risk and the associated credit loss expense and legal expense .

Credit Rating Actions 

The following table presents Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch credit ratings for SBNA, SHUSA, and Santander senior debt / long-term issuer rating: 

SANTANDER (1) 

SHUSA SBNA (2) 

Overall Outlook Fitch A BBB+ BBB+ Stable Moody's A2 Baa3 Baa1 Stable S&#38;P A BBB+ A- Stable 

(1) Senior preferred rating 

(2) Moody's rating represents SBNA long-term issuer rating 

SHUSA funds its operations independently of the other entities owned by Santander, and believes its business is not necessarily closely relat ed to the business or outlook of other entities owned by Santander. Future changes in the credit ratings of its parent, Santander, or the Kingdom of Spain, however, could impact SHUSA's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings, and any other change in the condition of Santander could affect SHUSA. 

At this time, SC is not rated by the major credit rating agencies. 

COVID-19 Summary 

In March 2020, the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, had materially impacted our business. Similar to many other financial institutions, we took measures to mitigate our customers&#8217; COVID-19-related economic challenges. We experienced an increase in requests for interest and amortization payment deferments extensions and modifications related to COVID-19 nationwide and a significant number of such payment deferments, extensions and modifications have been granted as detailed in the section of this MD&#38;A captioned "TDRs". The Bank also joined other U.S. banks in providing overdrawn customers full access to their EIPs by providing a temporary credit in the amount of their overdrawn balance as of the end of the day prior to receipt of their EIP (up to a limit of $5,000) for each of the three rounds of EIP. 

Please refer to Item 7 of the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding COVID-19. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

REGULATORY MATTERS 

The activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, including SBNA and SC, are subject to regulation under various U.S. federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations, supervise and conduct examinations, and may affect the operations and management of the Company and its ability to take certain actions, including making distributions to our parent, Santander. The Company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the Federal Reserve, including the FRB of Boston, and the CFPB. The Company's subsidiaries are further supervised by the OCC, the FRB of Atlanta, and the NYDFS. 

Payment of Divid ends 

SHUSA is the parent holding company of SBNA. SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described under the caption &#8220;Stress Tests and Capital Planning&#8221; in this section. Refer to the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&#38;A for detail of the capital actions of the Company and its subsidiaries during the period. 

In response to COVID-19, from June 2020 through June 30, 2021 the Federal Reserve implemented the Interim Policy, which restricted capital distributions to various measures of prior earnings. 

On April 27, 2021, the Company received written notification from the FRB that the FRB has approved SHUSA&#8217;s request for an exception from the prohibition in the Interim Policy restricting the payment of certain dividends in the second quarter of 2021. On April 30, 2021, the SC&#8217;s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.22 per share for shareholders as of May 10, 2021 and payable on May 20, 2021. 

On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary restrictions imposed by the Interim Policy would end June 30, 2021. Beginning July 1, 2021, firms are subject to the SCB capital rules. SHUSA&#8217;s 2020 SCB was 2.5%, equating to a 7% minimum limit under the SCB rules. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules are applicable to both SHUSA and SBNA. 

These rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations, including the Company and SBNA, to maintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%. A further capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios was phased in effective January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions to make capital distributions, including paying dividends. 

As described in Note 1, on January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL standard, which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance, net of income tax, and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $2.5 billion. As also described Note 1, the U.S. banking agencies in December 2018 approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations, including the Company, the option to phase in the day-one impact of CECL until the first quarter of 2023. On March 26, 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodology&#8217;s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. This interim rule was subsequently updated with technical amendments in a final rule dated September 30, 2020. The Company has elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the December 2018 rule. 

See the "Bank Regulatory Capital" section of this MD&#38;A for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company. 

Material restrictions can be imposed on SBNA, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized banks generally may not make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and all but well-capitalized banks are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the FDIA and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash divid ends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. At September 30, 2021, SBNA met the criteria to be classified as &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks. Under the final rule, firms' supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the SCB requirement, replacing the 2.5% of the RWA component under the prior capital conservation buffer requirement. The SCB is calculated as the maximum decline in CET1 in the severely adverse scenario (subject to a 2.5% floor) plus four quarters of dividends. The rule results in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to 4.5% of CET1 plus the SCB, any GSIB surcharge, and any countercyclical capital buffer. The GSIB buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to SHUSA. In the event a firm falls below its new minimums, the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Firms continue to submit a capital plan annually. Supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the final rule. 

Liquidity Rules 

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC have established a rule to implement the Basel III LCR for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets) such as the Company were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016. 

In October 2019, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a company&#8217;s asset size, cross-jurisdictional activity, reliance on short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, and off-balance sheet exposure. In light of the fact that the Company is under $250 billion in assets and has less than $50 billion in short-term wholesale funding, the Company is no longer required to disclose the US LCR. 

Resolution Planning 

The DFA requires the Company to prepare and update resolution plans. The 165(d) resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no &#8220;extraordinary support&#8221; is received from the U.S. or any other government. The most recent 165(d) resolution plan was submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in December 2018. In addition, under amended FDIA rules, the IDI resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors&#8217; rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution. 

TLAC 

The TLAC Rule requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured LTD. The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. GSIBs and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA must hold the higher of 18% of its RWAs or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC, of which 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of total consolidated assets must consist of LTD. In addition, SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of CET1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. The TLAC Rule became effective on January 1, 2019. 

Volcker Rule 

Section 13 of the BHCA, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; prohibits a &#8220;banking entity&#8221; from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a Covered Fund: (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities. 

Because the term &#8220;banking entity&#8221; includes an IDI, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries (including SBNA and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad. 

The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, recordkeeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule. 

In October 2019, the joint agencies responsible for administering the Volcker Rule finalized revisions to Volcker Rule. The final rule tailors the Volcker Rule&#8217;s compliance requirements to the amount of a firm&#8217;s trading activity, revise the definition of a trading account, clarify certain key provisions in the Volcker Rule, and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies. 

In July 2020, the joint agencies finalized a rule that revised the Volcker Rule further. The 2020 revisions provide an exemption for activities of qualifying foreign excluded funds, revise the exclusions from the definition of a &#8220;covered fund&#8221;, create new exclusions from the definition of a covered fund, and modify the definition of an ownership interest. The new rule became effective on October 1, 2020, and the Company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule. 

Risk Retention Rule 

The Federal Reserve's final credit risk retention rule generally requires sponsors of ABS to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and complies with these retention requirements. 

Market Risk Rule 

The market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold risk-based regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions. The bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal-risk based models. The market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the bank's internal risk based models, as well as qualitative requirements for the bank's management of market risk. Banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

A bank is subject to the market risk capi tal rules if its consolidated trading activity, defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its FFIEC 031 and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, equals the lesser of: (1) 10 percent or more of the bank's total assets as reported in its Call Report and FR Y-9C for the previous quarter, or (2) $1 billion or more. At September 30, 2019, SBNA reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold and, as a result, both the Company and SBNA began holding the market risk component within RWAs of the risk-based capital ratios, and submitted the FFIEC 102 - Market Risk Regulatory Report beginning for the period ended December 31, 2019. The incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the Company's risk-based capital ratios. 

Heightened Standards 

OCC guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as &#8220;heightened standards.&#8221; The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions&#8217; boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs transactions between SBNA and affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. 

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms'-length. As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Company faces elevated compliance risk in this area. 

Regulation AB II 

Regulation AB II, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for ABS. SC must comply with these rules, which impact all offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Exchange Act, for outstanding publicly-registered ABS, and affect SC's public securitization platform. 

CRA 

SBNA is subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. SBNA&#8217;s current CRA rating is "Outstanding." The OCC takes into account SBNA&#8217;s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications SBNA makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. 

Reference Rate Reform 

The March 5, 2021, announcement by the U.K.&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority confirmed the unavailability of LIBOR rates beyond June 30, 2023 and cessation of one-week and two-month LIBOR by December 31, 2021. ISDA announced these statements are an &#8220;Index Cessation Event&#8221; under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which in turn triggers a &#8220;Spread Adjustment Fixing Date&#8221; under the Bloomberg IBOR Fallback Rate Adjustments Rule Book. As a result, when LIBOR tenors cease and the fallback rates apply, fallbacks for derivatives under ISDA&#8217;s documentation shift to forms of the SOFR plus the fixed spread adjustment. 

The regulatory agencies also confirmed that the March 5, 2021 announcements constitute a &#8220;Benchmark Transition Event&#8221; with respect to all LIBOR settings. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

We hold loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate and that will be impacted by the cessation of LIBOR. Transition away from LIBOR to new reference rates presents legal, financial, reputational, and operational risks to the Company as well as to othe r participants in the market. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $21 billion of loans and approximately $5 billion of borrowings with LIBOR exposure. We also had approximately $64 billion in notional amounts of derivative contracts with LIBOR exposure. 

Under the guidance of our cross-functional LIBOR transition program, the Company is on track to offer products linked to alternative reference rates and to remediate existing contracts that use the LIBOR reference rate. We will substantially limit originations of new LIBOR-referenced products by December 1, 2021, and cease all new originations of LIBOR-referenced products by December 31, 2021. 

We have progressed on the following aspects of the LIBOR transition to date: 

Communications and training 

&#8226; Created and updated employee and customer-facing LIBOR transition web pages 

&#8226; Communicated with clients about the LIBOR transition through existing channels 

&#8226; Launched conduct risk training for client-facing staff members 

&#8226; Completed internal training on alternative reference rate product offerings 

Contracts remediation 

&#8226; Maintained current inventory of clients and contracts that have a dependency on LIBOR and that require re-negotiation 

&#8226; Prepared and delivered amendments to clients 

&#8226; Utilized LIBOR amendment fallback language for new or re-negotiated contracts 

&#8226; Adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol 

Products 

&#8226; Launched SOFR-based conforming adjustable rate mortgages (in line with FNMA and FHLMC requirements) in the third quarter of 2020 

&#8226; Maintained quarterly LIBOR exposure reporting 

&#8226; Developed SOFR pricing framework and shared with internal teams 

Models 

&#8226; Created an inventory and plan for remediation of models potentially impacted by the LIBOR cessation 

&#8226; Started development and validation of models impacted by the transition to alternative reference rates 

Accounting and tax 

&#8226; Started analysis of the accounting and tax impacts based on FASB and IRS guidance 

Systems 

&#8226; Completed technology systems updates and testing to support alternative reference rates

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Net interest income decreased $87.2 million and $60.8 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2020. The most significant factors contributing to the change were as follows: 

&#8226; Interest income on investment securities and interest-earning deposits decreased $115.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to an increase in average balances of $59.5 million and a decrease in average rates of $175.0 million. The decrease in rate was attributable to Federal Reserve actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

&#8226; Interest income on loans decreased $417.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to an increase in average loan balances of $16.9 million and a decrease in average rates of $434.4 million. This was the result of a lower overall interest rate environment offset by continued growth in RIC volume. 

&#8226; Interest expense on deposits and related customer accounts decreased $180.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances of $2.1 million and a decrease in average rates of $182.3 million. This was the result of lower deposit rates from the Federal Reserve setting overnight rates at zero in response to the economic uncertainty from COVID-19. 

&#8226; Interest expense on borrowed funds decreased $292.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to a decrease in average interest-bearing borrowings balances of $72.0 million and a decrease in average rates of $220.1 million. This was the result of an overall lower interest rate environment along with the repayment of debt. 

CREDIT LOSS EXPENSE (BENEFIT) 

The Company had a Credit loss expense / (benefit) of $19.5 million and $(221.7) million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to Credit loss expense $405.8 million and $2.6 billion for the comparable periods in 2020. The change year-over-year was primarily driven by the additional reserve in prior year to address credit risk associated with the COVID-19 outbreak and associated economic recession during 2020.

Total non-interest income decreased $107.3 million and increased $446.0 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2020. The changes for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 were primarily due to an increase in miscellaneous income, net discussed further below.

Miscellaneous income decreased $58.8 million and increased $538.8 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2020. This increase was primarily related to: 

&#8226; Gain on sale of operating leases increased for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020, driven by an increase in liquidated units. 

&#8226; Loss on the sale of non-mortgage loans increased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to the consumer RIC portfolio.

Total general, administrative and other expenses decreased $71.0 million and $2.0 billion for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to 2020. The most significant contributing factors were as follows: 

&#8226; Lease expense decreased for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 due to a shortage in car supply and receipt of lease subvention payments, which reduce lease expense related to depreciation. 

&#8226; The Company recorded no goodwill impairment in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021, compared to $1.8 billion during 2020. 

&#8226; Other expenses decreased $43.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 compared to 2020 mainly due to lower operational risk expense and legal fees, offset by a slight increase in employee expenses such as travel during the three-month period ended September 30, 2021.

Consumer Loans Secured By Real Estate 

Consumer loans secured by real estate decreased $1.3 billion, or 12.5%, from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021. This decrease was comprised of a decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio of $848.3 million, and a decrease in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio of $494.0 million. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured By Real Estate 

RICs and auto loans 

RICs and auto loans increased $2.3 billion, or 5.5%, from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021 . The increase in the RIC and auto loan portfolio was primarily due to increases in originations, net of securitizations, due to the Company's initiatives to improve our pricing, as well as, our dealer and customer experience, which have increased our competitive position in the market. RICs are collateralized by vehicle titles, and the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract. Most of the Company's RICs HFI are pledged against warehouse lines or securitization bonds. Refer to further discussion of these in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As of September 30, 2021, 62.1% of the Company's RIC and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans (defined by the Company as customers with a FICO score of below 640) with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of, among other things, a lack of or adverse credit history, low income levels and/or the inability to provide adequate down payments. This also includes 7.6% of loans for which no FICO score was available. While underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk, nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers. Additionally, higher unemployment rates, higher gasoline prices, unstable real estate values, re-sets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates, the general availability of consumer credit, and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies, defaults, and repossessions, as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products, weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default. Because SC's historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions, and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. 

The Company's automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers. The Company's robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting. Each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score usin g information such as FICO scores, DTI ratios, LTV ratios, and over 30 other predictive factors, placing the applicant in one of 100 pricing tiers. The pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends. In addition to the Company's automated process, it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review, consideration of exceptions, and review of deal structures with dealers. 

At September 30, 2021, a typical RIC was originated with an average annual percentage rate of 15.0% and was purchased from the dealer at a premium of 2.1%. All of the Company's RICs and auto loans are fixed-rate loans. 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans 

Personal unsecured and other consumer loans HFI increased from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021 by $653.7 million.

(1) Annualized net loan charge-offs are based on year-to-date charge-offs. 

Potential problem loans are loans not currently classified as NPLs for which management has doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with the present repayment terms. These assets are principally loans delinquent for more than 30 days but less than 90 days. Potential problem commercial loans totaled approximately $268.4 million and $229.2 million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Potential problem consumer loans amounted to $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. M an agement has included these loans in its evaluation of the Company's ACL and reserved for them during the respective periods. 

Non-performing assets increased to $2.0 billion, or 1.3% of total assets, at September 30, 2021, compared to $2.0 billion, or 1.3% of total assets, at December 31, 2020, primarily due to government stimulus payments and tax refunds provided to customers. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Commercial 

Commercial NPLs increased $17.0 million from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021. Commercial NPLs accounted for less than 1.0% of commercial LHFI at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in commercial NPLs was primarily comprised of an increase of $44.2 million in the Multifamily portfolio offset by a decrease of $21.5 million in the C&#38;I portfolio. 

Consumer Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 

RICs and amortizing personal loans are classified as non-performing when they are more than 60 DPD (i.e., 61 or more DPD) with respect to principal or interest. Except for loans accounted for using the FVO, at the time a loan is placed on non-performing status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. When an account is 60 days or less past due, it is returned to performing status and the Company returns to accruing interest on the loan. The accrual of interest on revolving personal loans continues until the loan is charged off. 

RIC TDRs are placed on non-accrual status when the account becomes past due more than 60 days. For loans in non-accrual status, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. For loans on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is resumed if a delinquent account subsequently becomes 60 days or less past due. NPLs in the RIC and auto loan portfolio increased by $68.6 million from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021. Non-performing RICs and auto loans accounted for 2.9% and 2.9% of total RICs and auto loans at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

Consumer Loans Secured by Real Estate 

The following table shows NPLs compared to total loans outstanding for the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively: 

September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands) Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit Residential mortgages Home equity loans and lines of credit NPLs - HFI $ 98,952 &#160; $ 92,998 &#160; $ 74,473 $ 91,606 Total LHFI 5,741,848 &#160; 3,614,472 &#160; 6,590,168 4,108,505 NPLs as a percentage of total LHFI 1.7 &#160; % 2.6 &#160; % 1.1 % 2.2 % 

The NPL ratio is usually higher for the Company's residential mortgage loan portfolio compared to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio due to a number of factors, including the prolonged workout and foreclosure resolution processes for residential mortgage loans, differences in risk profiles, and mortgage loans located outside the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Foreclosures on consumer loans secured by real estate were $39.6 million or 20.6% of non-performing consumer loans secured by real estate at September 30, 2021, compared to $46.2 million or 27.8% of consumer loans secured by real estate at December 31, 2020. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Delinquencies 

The Company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all (defined as 90%) of the scheduled payment by the due date. 

Overall, total delinquencies decreased by $196.8 million, or 4.7%, from December 31, 2020 to September 30, 2021, most significantly within the residential mortgage portfolio which decreased $172.4 million. Delinquent balances and nonaccrual balances overall were lower as of September 30, 2021, primarily due to the benefits of government stimulus payments and tax refunds provided to customers 

TDRs 

TDRs are loans that have been modified as the Company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans. TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions, limitations on accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferments of principal. 

TDRs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification, unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification. For most portfolios, TDRs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance, as long as the Company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full. RIC TDRs are placed on nonaccrual status when the Company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and, at the latest, when the account becomes more than 60 DPD. RIC TDRs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes 60 days or less past due. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral, the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters. To the extent the TDR is determined to be collateral-dependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral, the loan may not be returned to accrual status. 

The following table summarizes TDRs at the dates indicated:

(1) New TDRs includes drawdowns on lines of credit that have previously been classified as TDRs. 

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines, the Company may offer extensions (deferrals) to consumers on its RICs, whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan. The Company&#8217;s policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral to one deferral every six months, regardless of the length of any prior deferral. Further, the maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile RICs is eight, while some marine and RV contracts have a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term. Additionally, the Company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of months have passed since origination. During the deferral period, the Company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement. 

In March 2020, the Company began actively working with its borrowers impacted by COVID-19 and provided loan modification programs in accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidelines to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 on modifications. These programs temporarily revised the practices noted above during 2020 and increased the volume of modifications provided to our customers. Effective January 1, 2021 at SC and April 1, 2021 at SBNA, the Company has generally returned to pre-pandemic servicing practices, with the exception of an increased limit on the total months of extensions allowed. As of September 30, 2021, the overall modification volumes were consistent with volumes experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic and the number and dollar amount of active COVID-19 modifications was immaterial. 

The Company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time. Based on this evaluation, the Company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio. 

Changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables charged-off. However, the timing of a charge-off may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge-off. To the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged-off, historical charge-off ratios, loss confirmation periods, and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the ALLL for loans classified as TDRs are also impacted. Increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period, which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the ALLL and related credit loss expense. Changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the ALLL and related credit loss expense. For loans that are classified as TDRs, the Company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of TDRs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded. For loans that are considered collateral-dependent, such as certain bankruptcy modifications, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral, less its estimated costs to sell. 

CREDIT RISK 

The risk inherent in the Company&#8217;s loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality, and is affected by borrower-specific and economy-wide facts such as changes in unemployment, GDP, HPI, CRE price index, used vehicle index growth rates, and other factors. In general, there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss. The Company manages this risk through its underwriting, pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices, as well as geographic and other concentration limits. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company's ACL is principally based on various models subject to the Company's Model Risk Management Framework. New models are approved by the Company's Model Risk Management Committee. Models, inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually, and the Company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. 

Management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework. These adjustments are documented and reviewed through the Company&#8217;s risk management processes. Furthermore, management reviews, updates, and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis. This process involves an analysis of data integrity, review of loss and credit trends, a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts, and other analyses. 

ACL levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly. Required actions resulting from the Company's analysis, if necessary, are governed by its ACL Committee. The ACL levels are approved by the Board-level committees quarterly. 

Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the methodology used to determine the ACL and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

ACL 

There were no significant changes to the ACL during the three and six months ended September 30, 2021. Refer to the rollforward of the ACL in Note 3 to the Condensed C onsolidated Financial Statements. 

Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments 

The reserve for unfunded lending commitments decreased from $146.5 million at December 31, 2020 to $135.5 million at September 30, 2021. The decrease of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was due to the ordinary course of business.

GOODWILL 

The Company records the excess of the cost of acquired entities over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed as goodwill. Consistent with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize goodwill, and reviews the goodwill recorded for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the potential for goodwill impairment. At September 30, 2021, goodwill totaled $2.6 billion and represented 1.7% of total assets and 10.9% of total stockholder's equity. The following table shows goodwill by reporting units at September 30, 2021: 

(in thousands) CBB C&#38;I CRE &#38; VF CIB SC Total Goodwill at September 30, 2021 $ 297,802 $ 52,198 $ 1,095,071 $ 131,130 $ 1,019,960 $ 2,596,161 

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 each year. The Company conducted its most recent annual goodwill impairment tests as of October 1, 2020 using generally accepted valuation methods. 

The Company completes a quarterly review for impairment indicators over each of its reporting units, which includes consideration of economic and organizational factors that could impact the fair value of the Company's reporting units. As of the most recent review completed at the end of the third quarter of 2021, the Company did not identify any indicators which resulted in the Company's conclusion that an interim impairment test would be required to be completed. 

DEFERRED TAXES AND OTHER TAX ACTIVITY 

The Company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $602.8 million at September 30, 2021 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $45.6 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $648.4 million with respect to jurisdictional netting), compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of $171.2 million at December 31, 2020 (consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of $11.1 million and a deferred tax liability balance of $182.4 million). The $431.6 million increase in net deferred liability for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in net operating loss carryforwards. 

BANK REGULATORY CAPITAL 

The Company's capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework. 

The Company is subject to the reg ulations of certain federal, state, and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on SBNA&#8217;s capital calculations, SBNA was considered well-capitalized under the applicable capital framework. In addition, the Company's capital levels as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, based on the Company&#8217;s capital calculations, exceeded the required capital ratios for BHCs. 

For a discussion of Basel III, including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum U.S. regulatory capital ratios, see the section captioned "Regulatory Matters" in this MD&#38;A. 

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies also limit SBNA's ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. SBNA must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the bank's total distributions to SHUSA within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years, (2) the bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. The OCC's prior approval would also be required if SBNA were notified by the OCC that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition. 

Any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company paid cash dividends of zero and $125.0 million, respectively, to its common stock shareholder. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following schedule summarizes the actual capital balances of SHUSA and SBNA at September 30, 2021:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overall 

The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity. Liquidity represents the ability of the Company to obtain cost-effective funding to meet the needs of customers as well as the Company's financial obligations. Factors that impact the liquidity position of the Company include loan origination volumes, loan prepayment rates, the maturity structure of existing loans, core deposit growth levels, CD maturity structure and retention, the Company's credit ratings, investment portfolio cash flows, the maturity structure of the Company's wholesale funding, and other factors. These risks are monitored and managed centrally. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee reviews and approves the Company's liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis. This process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources. The Company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times. SHUSA conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios, all of which demonstrate that the Company has ample liquidity to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. 

Further changes to the credit ratings of SHUSA, Santander and its affiliates or the Kingdom of Spain could have a material adverse effect on SHUSA's business, including its liquidity and capital resources. The credit ratings of SHUSA have changed in the past and may change in the future, which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity. Any reductions in the long-term or short-term credit ratings of SHUSA would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade, which may include the loss of customer deposits, limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements. See further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the "Economic and Business Environment" section of this MD&#38;A. 

Sources of Liquidity 

Company and Bank 

The Company and SBNA have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements, including SBNA's core deposit base, liquid investment securities portfolio, ability to acquire large deposits, FHLB borrowings, wholesale deposit purchases, and federal funds purchased, as well as through securitizations in the ABS market and committed credit lines from third-party banks and Santander. In addition, the Company has other sources of funding to meet its liquidity requirements such as dividends and returns of investments from its subsidiaries, short-term investments held by non-bank affiliates, and access to the capital markets. 

As of September 30, 2021 , SBNA has borrowed $1.0 billion from SHUSA. This transaction eliminates in consolidation. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

SC 

SC requires a significant amount of liquidity to originate and acquire loans and leases and to service debt. SC funds its operations through its lending relationships with 13 third-party banks, Santander and SHUSA, and through securitizations in the ABS market and third party flow agreements. SC seeks to issue debt that appropriately matches the cash flows of the assets that it originates. SC has more than $7.9 billion of stockholders&#8217; equity that supports its access to the securitization markets, credit facilities, and flow agreements. 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, SC completed on-balance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately $6.2 billion, including: 

&#8226; securitization on its SDART platform for approximately $2.5 billion; 

&#8226; securitizations on its DRIVE, deeper subprime platform, for approximately $1.8 billion; and 

&#8226; lease securitization on its SRT platform for approximately $1.9 billion. 

SC also completed approximately $0.3 billion in asset sales to third parties. 

For information regarding SC's debt, see Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

IHC 

In 2017, SIS entered into a revolving subordinated loan agreement with SHUSA, not to exceed $290.0 million. This was subsequently increased to $895.0 million in 2018 to provide additional capital to the entity for its expanding capital markets program. Given additional liquidity needs from the program that now includes billing and delivery services for debt and equity issuances, the subordinated line with SIS was renegotiated in July 2021 to $750.0 million with an additional liquidity line of $750.0 million to support the new activity. 

At September 30, 2021, there were no outstanding balances on the subordinated loan or the liquidity line. 

BSI's primary sources of liquidity are from customer deposits and deposits from affiliated banks. 

Institutional borrowings 

The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios, and maintains contingency plans consistent with the Company&#8217;s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These include cash, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow at the FHLB and the FRB&#8217;s discount window. 

Available Liquidity 

As of September 30, 2021, SBNA had approximately $16.2 billion in committed liquidity from the FHLB and the FRB. Of this amount, $15.3 billion was unused and therefore provides additional borrowing capacity and liquidity for the Company. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents and LHFS) and securities AFS exclusive of securities pledged as collateral) totaled approximately $29.1 billion and $23.5 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 36.8% and 31.8% of total deposits at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, SBNA and BSI had $2.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, in cash held at the FRB. Management believes that the Company has ample liquidity to fund its operations. 

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 

Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2021 2020 Net cash flows from operating activities $ 5,961,580 &#160; $ 4,894,072 Net cash flows from investing activities (2,692,526) (161,803) Net cash flows from financing activities 3,024,746 &#160; (1,559,594) 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Cash flows from operating activities 

Net cash flow from operating activities increased by $1.1 billion from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of and collections on LHFS which includes the SC sale of its Bluestem personal lending portfolio. 

Cash flows from investing activities 

Net cash flow from investing activities decreased by $2.5 billion from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in purchases of LHFI and an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements which began in the second quarter of 2021. 

Cash flows from financing activities 

Net cash flow from financing activities increased by $4.6 billion from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in deposits and an increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements, offset by decreases in cash due to net borrowing activity. 

See the SCF for further details on the Company's sources and uses of cash. 

Credit Facilities 

Third-Party Revolving Credit Facilities 

Warehouse Lines 

SC has one credit facility with eight banks providing an aggregate commitment of $3.5 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support Chrysler Capital lease financing. The facility requires reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, or residual loss ratios, as well as other metrics exceeding specified thresholds. 

SC has eight credit facilities with eleven banks providing an aggregate commitment of $8.3 billion for the exclusive use of providing short-term liquidity needs to support core and CCAP loan financing. As of September 30, 2021, there was an outstanding balance of approximately zero on these facilities in the aggregate. These facilities reduced advance rates in the event of delinquency, credit loss, as well as various other metrics exceeding specific thresholds. 

Repurchase Agreements 

SC also obtains financing through investment management or repurchase agreements under which it pledges retained subordinate bonds on its own securitizations as collateral for repurchase agreements with various borrowers and at renewable terms ranging up to 365 days. As of September 30, 2021, there was no outstanding balance under any repurchase agreements. 

Related Party Credit Facilities 

The Company provides SC with $0.5 billion of committed revolving credit and $2.5 billion of contingent liquidity that can be drawn on an unsecured basis. The Company also provides SC with $5.6 billion of term financing with maturities ranging from December 2021 to May 2025. These loans eliminate in the consolidation of SHUSA. Santander provides SC with $4.0 billion of unsecured financing with maturities ranging from June 2022 and September 2022. 

Secured Structured Financings 

SC's secured structured financings primarily consist of both public, SEC-registered securitizations, as well as private securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, and privately issues amortizing notes. SC has on-balance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative ABS balance of approximately $29.0 billion. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Deficiency and Debt Forward Flow Agreement 

In addition to SC's credit facilities and secured structured financings, SC has a flow agreement in place with a third party for charged-off assets. Loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on SC's balance sheet, but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing 

Beginning in 2017, SC had the option to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible prime loans to Santander through securitization platforms. As all of the notes and residual interests in the securitizations are acquired by Santander, SC recorded these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removed the sold assets from its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beginning in 2018, this program was replaced with a new program with SBNA, whereby SC has agreed to provide SBNA with origination support services in connection with the processing, underwriting, and purchasing of retail loans, primarily from Stellantis dealers, all of which are serviced by SC. 

SC also continues to periodically execute securitizations under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. After retaining the required credit risk retention via a 5% vertical interest, SC transfers all remaining notes and residual interests in these securitizations to third parties. SC subsequently records these transactions as true sales of the RICs securitized, and removes the sold assets from its Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Uses of Liquidity 

The Company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings, as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests. SIS uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions, as well as billing and delivery services. The primary use of liquidity for BSI is to meet customer liquidity requirements, such as maturing deposits, investment activities, funds transfers, and payment of operating expenses. 

At September 30, 2021, the Company's liquidity to meet debt payments, debt service and debt maturities was in excess of 12 months. 

D ividends, Contributions and Stock Issuances 

As of September 30, 2021, the Company had 530,391,043 shares of common stock outstanding. 

On March 31, 2021, SC paid a cash dividend of $0.22 per share and a special dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock for a total of $0.44 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2021. SC also paid a dividend of $0.22 per share in May 2021 and August 2021. SHUSA has requested regulatory approval to authorize SC's Board of Directors to declare a dividend in the fourth quarter. To date, approval has not been received. 

SC has paid a total of $269.3 million in dividends through September 30, 2021, of which $53.2 million has been paid to NCI and $216.1 million has been paid to the Company, which eliminates in the consolidated results of the Company. 

In August 2021, SHUSA entered into a definitive agreement whereby SHUSA agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of SC Common Stock not already owned by SHUSA via an all-cash tender offer. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHUSA commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of SC Common Stock that SHUSA does not already own at a price of $41.50 per share in cash. SHUSA agreed to acquire all remaining shares not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same price as in the tender offer. Consummation of the tender offer is subject to various conditions, including regulatory approval by the Federal Reserve and other customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the transaction, SC will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHUSA. 

Share Repurchases 

In June 2019, SC announced that the SC Board of Directors had authorized purchases by SC of up to $1.1 billion, excluding commissions, of its outstanding common stock effective from the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, SC purchased shares of SC Common Stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer, and extended the share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter of 2020. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

On July 31, 2020, SC announced that the Company&#8217;s request for certain exceptions to the Interim Policy prohibiting share repurchases (other than repurchases relating to issuances of common stock under employee stock ownership plans) and limiting dividends paid by certain CCAR institutions to the average trailing four quarters' of net income, had been approved. Such exception approval permitted SC to continue its share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter of 2020. On August 10, 2020, SC announced that it had substantially exhausted the amount of shares SC was permitted to repurchase under the exception approval, and that SC expected to repurchase an immaterial number of shares remaining under the exception approval. 

After substantially exhausting its share repurchase authorization on August 10, 2020 and through the end of the second quarter of 2021, SC was only permitted to repurchase a number of shares of SC Common Stock equal to the amount of share issuances related to SC&#8217;s expensed employee compensation. SC does not presently have permission to repurchase any shares of SC Common Stock. 

Please find below the details of SC's tender offer and other share repurchase programs for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020:

The Company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. See further discussion on these risks in Note 12 and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Company&#8217;s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in market interest rates, and consumer preferences, affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed by the Company's Treasury group and measured by its Market Risk Department, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Committee. In managing interest rate risk, the Company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios, while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin. To achieve these objectives, the Treasury group works closely with each business line in the Company. The Treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk, including wholesale funding maturity targeting, investment portfolio purchase strategies, asset securitizations/sales, and financial derivatives. 

Interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates: basis risk, repricing risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes, such as differences in the extent of changes in Federal funds rates compared with the three-month LIBOR. Repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing, such as one-month versus three-month reset dates, as well as the related maturities. Yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves. Option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products. These four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations, shocks to those simulations, and scenario and market value analyses, and the subsequent results are reviewed by management. Numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses, including assumptions about new business volumes, loan and investment prepayment rates, deposit flows, interest rate curves, economic conditions and competitor pricing. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The Company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk, including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense, to estimate the Company's net interest income sensitivity. This simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the Company's net interest income sensitivity. These scenarios include both parallel and non-parallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above. This information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the Company&#8217;s risk position remains within SHUSA Board of Directors-approved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates. 

The table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s net interest income based on interest rate changes at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to net interest income would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Down 100 basis points (1.69) % (1.12) % Up 100 basis points 4.68 % 3.18 % Up 200 basis points 8.86 % 6.25 % 

MVE Analysis 

The Company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing MVE modeling. This analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the Company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet. MVE is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities. The MVE calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet, and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size, balance sheet mix, yield curve relationships or product spreads, which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes. 

Management examines the effect of interest rate changes on MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk, and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates. The following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the Company&#8217;s MVE at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

The following estimated percentage increase/(decrease) to MVE would result If interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Down 100 basis points (4.42) % (6.18) % Up 100 basis points (0.45) % 1.62 % Up 200 basis points (3.00) % 0.51 % 

As of September 30, 2021, the Company&#8217;s profile reflected a decrease of MVE of 4.42% for downward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points and a decrease of 0.45% for upward parallel interest rate shocks of 100 basis points. The asymmetrical sensitivity between up 100 and down 100 shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgage-related products, the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base (largely NMDs). 

In downward parallel interest rate shocks, mortgage-related products&#8217; prepayments increase, their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited. At the same time, with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels, the Company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its NMD customers. For upward parallel interest rate shocks, extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the Company&#8217;s mortgage-related products, which are predominantly long-term and fixed-rate; and for larger shocks, the loss in market value is not offset by the change in NMDs. 

Limitations of Interest Rate Risk Analyses 

Since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain, the Company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or MVE. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume, characteristics of new business, behavior of existing positions, and changes in market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. 

Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Uses of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 

To mitigate interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange, equity and credit risks, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. 

Through the Company&#8217;s capital markets and mortgage banking activities, it is subject to price risk. The Company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios. In addition, SHUSA's Board of Directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities. The level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements, and will vary from period to period. 

Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities, assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments. The nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments. 

The Company's derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. As part of its overall business strategy, SBNA originates residential mortgages. It sells a portion of this production to the FHLMC, the FNMA, and private investors. The Company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments. 

The Company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold. The majority of the Company's residential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. As deemed appropriate, the Company economically hedges MSRs, using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase MBS. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. 

The Company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options, which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products.
