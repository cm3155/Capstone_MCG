MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi 
demonstrated substantial progress across the franchise during 
2023, despite the impact of several notable items in the fourth 
quarter:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Citi’s revenues increased 4% versus the prior year, 
reflecting an increase in net interest income in Services 
and U.S. Personal Banking (USPB), driven by higher 
interest rates, as well as loan growth in cards. The 
increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-
interest revenues, primarily driven by approximately $1.9 
billion in aggregate translation losses (including 
approximately $880 million in the fourth quarter) due to 
devaluations of the Argentine peso during the year, the 
impact of lower volatility in Markets and the contraction 
of the global investment banking wallet in Investment 
Banking. 
Citi’s expenses increased 10% versus the prior year. The 
increase included fourth-quarter pretax charges of 
approximately $1.7 billion associated with the FDIC 
special assessment and approximately $780 million of 
restructuring charges. Excluding both of these charges, 
expenses increased 5%, driven by increased investments 
in other risk and controls and technology, elevated 
business-as-usual severance costs and additional 
transformation and business-led investments. The increase 
was partially offset by productivity savings and expense 
reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-
downs (see “Expenses” below).
Citi’s cost of credit was $9.2 billion versus $5.2 billion in 
the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by 
higher cards net credit losses in Branded Cards and Retail 
Services, reflecting normalization from historically low 
levels. The increase was also due to net builds in the 
allowance for credit losses (ACL), including 
approximately $1.9 billion in builds related to increases in 
transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and 
Argentina (including approximately $1.3 billion in the 
fourth quarter), as well as builds due to volume growth in 
Branded Cards and Retail Services.
Citi returned $6.1 billion to common shareholders in the 
form of dividends ($4.1 billion) and share repurchases 
($2.0 billion).
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under 
the Basel III Standardized Approach increased to 13.4% 
as of December 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of 
December 31, 2022 (see “Capital Resources” below). This 
compares to Citi’s required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio 
of 12.3% as of October 1, 2023 under the Basel III 
Standardized Approach.
Citi closed the four remaining signed consumer banking 
sale transactions in 2023. Citi also continued to make 
progress with the wind-downs of the Korea and China 
consumer banking businesses and the Russia consumer, 
local commercial and institutional businesses, as well as 
the planned initial public offering of Citi’s consumer 

6

banking and small business and middle-market banking 
operations in Mexico, and restarted the sales process for 
its Poland consumer banking business.

2023 Results Summary

Citigroup
Citigroup reported net income of $9.2 billion, or $4.04 per 
share, compared to net income of $14.8 billion, or $7.00 per 
share in the prior year. Net income decreased 38% versus the 
prior year, driven by the higher expenses, the higher cost of 
credit and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by the 
higher revenues. Citigroup’s effective tax rate was 27% in 
2023 versus 19% in the prior year, largely driven by the 
geographic mix of earnings (see Note 10). 

As discussed above, results for 2023 included several 
notable items impacting pretax revenues, expenses and cost of 
credit:

•

•

•

•

Approximately $1.9 billion of aggregate translation losses 
in revenues due to devaluations of the Argentine peso
Approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate reserve builds 
related to increases in transfer risk associated with 
exposures in Russia and Argentina, driven by safety and 
soundness considerations under U.S. banking law
An approximate $1.7 billion charge to operating expenses 
related to the FDIC special assessment in the fourth 
quarter
Approximately $780 million of restructuring charges in 
the fourth quarter, recorded in operating expenses in 
Corporate/Other within All Other (managed basis), related 
to actions taken as part of Citi’s organizational 
simplification initiatives

In total, on an after-tax basis the notable items were $(5.4) 

billion.

Additionally, results for 2023 included pretax divestiture-
related impacts of approximately $1.0 billion (approximately 
$659 million after-tax), primarily driven by gains on sale of 
Citi’s India and Taiwan consumer banking businesses. (See 
“All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” 
below.) 

The above notable items and divestiture-related impacts, 
collectively, had a $2.40 negative impact on EPS in 2023. For 
additional information on the translation losses due to the 
devaluations of the Argentine peso, see “Managing Global 
Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” below and 
“Services,” “Markets” and “Banking” below. Excluding the 
notable items and divestiture-related impacts, EPS was $6.44. 
(As used throughout this Form 10-K, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the notable items 
and divestiture-related impacts are non-GAAP financial 
measures.) 

Results for 2022 included pretax divestiture-related 
impacts of $82 million. (See “All Other—Divestiture-Related 
Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.) Collectively, 
divestiture-related impacts had a $0.09 negative impact on 

 
EPS. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS in 2022 was 
$7.09. Results in 2022 also included approximately $820 
million of translation losses in revenues due to the 
devaluations of the Argentine peso. 

Citigroup revenues of $78.5 billion in 2023 increased 4% 

on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, 
revenues of $77.1 billion also increased 4% versus the prior 
year. Excluding both divestiture-related and Argentine peso 
devaluation impacts, revenues of $79 billion in 2023 increased 
5% versus the prior year. The increase in revenues reflected 
strength across Services and USPB, partially offset by declines 
in Markets, Banking and Wealth, as well as the revenue 
reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-downs 
in All Other (managed basis).

Citigroup’s end-of-period loans were $689 billion, up 5% 

versus the prior year, largely driven by growth in USPB. 

Citigroup’s end-of-period deposits were approximately 
$1.3 trillion, down 4% versus the prior year. The decline in 
deposits was largely due to a reduction in Services, reflecting 
quantitative tightening and a shift of deposits to higher-
yielding investments in USPB and Wealth in 2023. For 
additional information about Citi’s deposits by business, 
including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective 
business’s results of operations and “Liquidity Risk—
Deposits” below.

Expenses
Citigroup’s operating expenses of $56.4 billion increased 10% 
from the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi incurred 
the approximate $1.7 billion charge associated with the FDIC 
special assessment and approximately $780 million of 
restructuring charges related to Citi’s organizational 
simplification initiatives (see Note 9). Expenses also included 
divestiture-related impacts of $372 million in 2023 and $696 
million in the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related 
impacts, expenses of $56 billion increased 11% versus the 
prior year. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, the 
restructuring charges and the FDIC special assessment, 
expenses of $53.5 billion increased 6%, driven by increased 
investments in other risk and controls and technology, 
elevated business-as-usual severance costs and additional 
transformation and business-led investments. The increase was 
partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions 
from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in Legacy 
Franchises (managed basis) within All Other (managed basis). 
Citi expects to incur additional costs related to its 
organizational simplification in the first quarter of 2024.

Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and 
claims was a cost of $9.2 billion, compared to $5.2 billion in 
the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net credit 
losses in Branded Cards and Retail Services, reflecting the 
normalization to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023, and 
net builds in the allowance for credit losses (ACL), including 
approximately $1.9 billion related to increases in transfer risk 
associated with exposures in Russia and Argentina 
(approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as well as 
builds due to volume growth in Branded Cards and Retail 
Services. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, including 

7

the builds for transfer risk, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates—Citi’s Allowance for 
Credit Losses (ACL)” below. 

Net credit losses of $6.4 billion increased 70% from the 
prior year. Consumer net credit losses of $6.2 billion increased 
71%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit loss rates 
from historically low levels. Corporate net credit losses 
increased to $250 million from $178 million.

Citi expects to incur higher net credit losses in 2024, 
primarily due to higher cards net credit loss rates, which Citi 
expects to rise above pre-pandemic levels and, on a full-year 
basis, peak in 2024. The higher net credit losses expectation is 
already reflected in the Company’s ACL on loans for 
outstanding balances at December 31, 2023.

For additional information on Citi’s consumer and 

corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of 
operations and “Credit Risk” below.

Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio was 13.4% as of December 31, 
2023, compared to 13.0% as of December 31, 2022, based on 
the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-
weighted assets (RWA). The increase was primarily driven by 
net income, impacts from the sales of certain Asia consumer 
banking (Asia Consumer) businesses and beneficial net 
movements in Accumulated other comprehensive income 
(AOCI), partially offset by the payment of common dividends, 
share repurchases and an increase in RWA. 

In 2023, Citi repurchased $2.0 billion of common shares 

and paid $4.1 billion of common dividends (see “Unregistered 
Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities 
and Dividends” below). Citi will continue to assess common 
share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given 
uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. For 
additional information on capital-related risks, trends and 
uncertainties, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital 
Standards and Developments” as well as “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Compliance
Risks” below.

Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of 

December 31, 2023 was 5.8%, unchanged from December 31, 
2022 as higher Tier 1 Capital was offset by an increase in 
Total Leverage Exposure. For additional information on Citi’s 
capital ratios and related components, see “Capital Resources” 
below.

Services
Services net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, as higher 
expenses and higher cost of credit were partially offset by the 
increase in revenues. Services expenses of $10.0 billion 
increased 15%, primarily driven by continued investment in 
technology and other risk and controls, volume-related 
expenses and business-led investments in Treasury and Trade 
Solutions (TTS), partially offset by the impact of productivity 
savings. Cost of credit increased to $950 million from $207 
million the prior year, largely driven by an ACL build in other 
assets, primarily due to the reserve build for increases in 
transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and 
Argentina. 

Services revenues of $18.1 billion increased 16%, driven 

by net interest income growth of 28%, partially offset by an 
8% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the 
Argentine peso devaluations (approximately $1.2 billion in 
2023 and approximately $0.4 billion in 2022). Excluding this 
impact, non-interest revenue increased 6%. 

TTS revenues of $13.6 billion increased 16%, driven by 
25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% 
decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the 
Argentine peso devaluations. The increase in TTS net interest 
income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost 
of funds management across currencies, as well as growth in 
deposits. Excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, 
non-interest revenue increased 10%, driven by continued 
growth in underlying drivers. 

Securities Services revenues of $4.4 billion increased 

15%, as net interest income grew 46%, partially offset by a 
5% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the 
Argentine peso devaluations. The increase in net interest 
income was driven by higher interest rates across currencies 
and cost of funds management, partially offset by lower 
average deposits.

Excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-
interest revenue increased 1%, driven by increased fees from 
higher AUC/AUA balances from new client business and 
deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued 
elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Services in 2023, see “Services” below.

Markets
Markets net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, driven by 
lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit. 
Markets expenses of $13.2 billion increased 7%, primarily 
driven by investments in transformation, technology and other 
risk and controls, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost 
of credit increased to $437 million from $155 million in the 
prior year, driven by an ACL build in other assets, largely due 
to the reserve build for increases in transfer risk associated 
with exposures in Russia and Argentina.

Markets revenues of $18.9 billion decreased 6%, driven 

by a 6% decrease in Fixed Income markets and a 9% decrease 
in Equity markets. The decrease in Fixed Income was driven 
by a decrease in rates and currencies and spread products 
reflecting lower volatility, the impact of the Argentine peso 
devaluations, a strong prior-year comparison and a significant 
slowdown in activity in December 2023. The decrease in 
Equity markets was primarily due to a decline in equity 
derivatives, due to lower institutional activity, spread 
compression and lower volatility.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Markets in 2023, see “Markets” below.

Banking
Banking reported a net loss of $48 million, compared to net 
income of $386 million in the prior year, primarily driven by 
lower Corporate Lending revenues, including the impact of a 
loss on loan hedges, and higher expenses, partially offset by 
lower cost of credit. Banking expenses of $4.9 billion 
increased 9%, primarily driven by the absence of an 

8

operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-led 
investments and the impact of business-as-usual severance, 
partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a 
benefit of $165 million, compared to cost of credit of $549 
million in the prior year, driven by ACL releases in loans and 
unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by an ACL 
build in other assets.

Banking revenues of $4.6 billion decreased 15%, 

including the $443 million loss on loan hedges in 2023 and the 
$307 million gain on loan hedges in the prior year. Excluding 
the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $5.0 
billion decreased 2%, as slightly higher revenues in 
Investment Banking were more than offset by lower Corporate 
Lending revenues. Investment Banking revenues of $2.5 
billion increased 1%, driven by lower markdowns in non-
investment-grade loan commitments. The increase in revenue 
was largely offset by an overall decline in global investment 
banking wallet, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and 
volatility continued to impact client activity. Excluding the 
impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending 
revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower volumes on 
continued balance sheet optimization. The decline in revenues 
also reflected approximately $134 million in translation losses 
in Argentina due to devaluations of the Argentine peso, 
including a $64 million translation loss in the fourth quarter of 
2023. (As used throughout this Form 10-K, Citi’s results of 
operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the 
gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.) 
For additional information on the results of operations of 

Banking in 2023, see “Banking” below.

U.S. Personal Banking
USPB net income of $1.8 billion decreased 34%, reflecting 
higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by 
higher revenues. USPB expenses increased 3%, primarily 
driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and 
technology, business-led investments and business-as-usual 
severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost 
of credit increased to $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in 
the prior year. The increase was largely driven by higher net 
credit losses and a higher net ACL build, primarily reflecting 
growth in loan balances in Branded Cards and Retail Services. 
Net credit losses increased 79%, primarily reflecting 
normalization from historically low levels in U.S. cards, as net 
credit loss rates for both Branded Cards and Retail Services 
reached pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023.

USPB revenues of $19.2 billion increased 14%, due to 
higher net interest income (up 12%), driven by strong loan 
growth and higher deposit spreads, as well as higher non-
interest revenue (up 19%). Branded Cards revenues of $10.0 
billion increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net 
interest income, as average loans increased 13%. Retail 
Services revenues of $6.6 billion increased 21%, primarily 
driven by the higher net interest income from loan growth, as 
well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner 
payments, driven by higher net credit losses. Retail Banking 
revenues of $2.6 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by 
higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially 
offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and 
the associated deposit balances to Wealth.

CITI’S CONSENT ORDER COMPLIANCE
Citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the 
target outcome to change Citi’s business and operating models 
such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and 
improve Citi’s value to customers, clients and shareholders. 

This includes efforts to effectively implement the October 

2020 Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) consent orders issued to 
Citigroup and Citibank, respectively. In the second quarter of 
2021, Citi made an initial submission to the OCC, and 
submitted its plans to address the consent orders to both 
regulators during the third quarter of 2021. Citi continues to 
work constructively with the regulators and provides to both 
regulators on an ongoing basis additional information 
regarding its plans and progress. Citi will continue to reflect 
their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts.

As discussed above, Citi’s efforts include continued 
investments in its transformation, including the remediation of 
its consent orders. Citi’s CEO has made the strengthening of 
Citi’s risk and control environment a strategic priority and has 
established a Chief Operating Officer organization to 
centralize program management. In addition, the Citigroup 
and Citibank Boards of Directors each formed a 
Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee of 
each Board, to provide oversight of management’s 
remediation efforts under the consent orders. The Citi Board 
of Directors has determined that Citi’s plans are responsive to 
the Company’s objectives and that progress continues to be 
made on execution of the plans. 

For additional information about the consent orders, see 
“Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” below and Citi’s Current 
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2020. 

For additional information on the results of operations of 

USPB in 2023, see “U.S. Personal Banking” below.

Wealth
Wealth net income of $346 million decreased 64%, reflecting 
lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower 
cost of credit. Wealth expenses increased 10% to $6.6 billion, 
primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and 
controls and technology, partially offset by productivity 
savings and re-pacing of strategic investments. Cost of credit 
was a net benefit of $2 million, compared to cost of credit of 
$306 million in the prior year, largely driven by a net ACL 
release.

Wealth revenues of $7.1 billion decreased 5%, largely 
driven by lower net interest income (down 6%), driven by 
lower deposit spreads, as well as lower non-interest revenue 
(down 3%), largely driven by investment product revenue 
headwinds, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of 
certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from 
USPB.

For additional information on the results of operations of 

Wealth in 2023, see “Wealth” below.

All Other (Managed Basis)
All Other (managed basis) net loss of $2.1 billion, compared to 
net income of $163 million in the prior year, was driven by 
higher expenses, primarily due to the $1.7 billion FDIC 
special assessment, and higher cost of credit due to ACL 
builds for loans in Mexico Consumer and other assets, 
reflecting an increase in transfer risk associated with 
exposures in Russia. The higher expenses and cost of credit 
were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year 
release of cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) losses (net 
of hedges) from AOCI, recorded in revenues (approximately 
$140 million pretax), and in discontinued operations 
(approximately $260 million pretax), related to the substantial 
liquidation of a U.K. consumer legacy operation (see Note 2). 
For additional information on the results of operations of 

All Other (managed basis) in 2023, see “All Other—
Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” and “All 
Other (Managed Basis)” below. 

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory 
challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely affect 
economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, 
among others, continued elevated interest rates, elevated 
inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to 
China, the Russia–Ukraine war and escalating conflicts in the 
Middle East. These and other factors have negatively impacted 
global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and 
have resulted in a continued risk of recession in various 
regions and countries globally. In addition, these and other 
factors could adversely affect Citi’s customers, clients, 
businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of 
operations and financial condition during 2024. 

For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks 

that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of 
operations, capital and other financial condition during 2024,

SERVICES

Services includes Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services. TTS provides an integrated suite of tailored cash 
management, trade and working capital solutions to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations. 
Securities Services provides cross-border support for clients, providing on-the-ground local market expertise, post-trade technologies, 
customized data solutions and a wide range of securities services solutions that can be tailored to meet clients’ needs.

Services revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. Services earns fee income for 
assisting clients with transactional services and clearing. Revenue generated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and fees. 
Revenue is also generated from assets under custody and administration and is recognized when the associated service is satisfied, 
which normally occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the client and provided by Citi. Revenue generated from these 
activities is primarily recorded in Administration and other fiduciary fees. For additional information on these various types of 
revenues, see Note 5. Services revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with 
Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

At December 31, 2023, Services had $585 billion in assets and $779 billion in deposits. Securities Services managed $25.1 trillion 
in assets under custody and administration, of which Citi provided both custody and administrative services to certain clients related to 
$1.8 trillion of such assets. Managed assets under trust were $4.1 trillion.

2023 vs. 2022
Net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, primarily driven by 
higher expenses and higher cost of credit, partially offset by 
higher revenues.

Expenses were up 15%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in technology and other risk and controls, volume-
related expenses and business-led investments in TTS, 
partially offset by the impact of productivity savings. 

Revenues increased 16%, driven by higher revenues in 

Provisions were $950 million, compared to $207 million 

both TTS and Securities Services, largely driven by net 
interest income growth, partially offset by lower non-interest 
revenue due to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluations.
TTS revenues increased 16%, reflecting 25% growth in 

net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in 
non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was 
primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds 
management across currencies as well as growth in deposits. 
Average deposits increased 2%, largely driven by growth in 
international markets. The decrease in non-interest revenue 
was driven by approximately $1.0 billion in translation losses 
in revenues in Argentina due to devaluations of the Argentine 
peso, including a $0.5 billion translation loss in the fourth 
quarter of 2023. Excluding these translation losses, non-
interest revenue grew 10%, reflecting continued growth in 
underlying drivers, including higher cross-border flows (up 
15%), U.S. dollar clearing volumes (up 6%) and commercial 
card spend (up 16%). 

Securities Services revenues increased 15%, as net 
interest income grew 46%, driven by higher interest rates 
across currencies and cost of funds management, partially 
offset by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits and 
lower non-interest revenue. The decline in average deposits 
largely reflected the impact of monetary tightening. The 
decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by approximately 
$0.2 billion in translation losses in revenues in Argentina due 
to the Argentine peso devaluations, including a $0.1 billion 
translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decline in 
non-interest revenues was partially offset by increased fees 
from higher AUC/AUA balances from new client business and 
deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued 
elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer Services.

in the prior year, primarily driven by an ACL build in other 
assets.

The net ACL build was $910 million, compared to $156 

million in the prior year, primarily due to an ACL build in 
other assets related to transfer risk associated with exposures 
in Russia and Argentina, driven by safety and soundness 
considerations under U.S. banking law. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

For additional information on Services’ corporate credit 

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—
Corporate Credit” below.

For additional information on trends in Services’ deposits 

and loans, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk—
Loans” and “—Deposits” below.

risks related to Services’ future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global

2022 vs. 2021
Net income of $4.9 billion increased 30%, primarily driven by 
higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher 
cost of credit.

Services revenues were up 25%, driven by higher 

revenues in both TTS and Securities Services.

TTS revenues increased 29%, largely due to 49% growth 
in net interest income, reflecting deepening of existing client 
relations and gaining new clients across segments. The 
increase in net interest income was also driven by the benefits 
from higher interest rates, balance sheet optimization, higher

average deposits and higher average loans. Average deposits 
grew 1%, as volume growth was partially offset by the impact 
of foreign exchange translation. Average loans grew 11%, 
primarily driven by the strength in trade flows in International, 
partially offset by loan sales in North America. 

Securities Services revenues increased 14%, primarily 
driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting higher 
interest rates across currencies as well as the impact of foreign 
exchange translation. Non-interest revenues decreased 4%, 
due to the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower 
fees in the custody business due to lower AUC/AUA (decline 
of 6%), driven by declines in global financial markets. The 
decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by 
continued elevated levels of corporate activity in Issuer 
Services and new client onboarding of $1.2 trillion in AUC/
AUA. Average deposits declined 1%, due to clients seeking 
higher rate alternatives.

Expenses were up 13%, primarily driven by continued 
investment in Citi’s technology and other risk and controls, 
volume-related expenses and business-led investments in TTS. 
Provisions were $207 million, compared to a benefit of 

$263 million in the prior year, driven by an ACL build on 
loans and unfunded lending commitments.

The ACL build was $156 million, compared to a release 

of $305 million in the prior year. The ACL build was 
primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic 
assumptions.

MARKETS

Markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services 
across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset 
classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.

As a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the 
differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on 
the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions. Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest 
income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is 
recorded as Net interest income.

The amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in 

market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their 
implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues include revenues earned by Citi that 
are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with Banking—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking, Markets and Services 
products sold to Corporate Lending clients. 

Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in 
increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the 
fair value of product inventory. Management of the Markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
Markets international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 

countries and jurisdictions.

2023 vs. 2022
Net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, primarily driven by 
lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit.

Revenues declined 6%, primarily driven by lower Fixed 

Income markets revenues, lower Equity markets revenues and 
the impact of business actions taken to reduce RWA, 
compared with very strong performance in the prior year. Citi 
expects that revenues in its Markets business will continue to 
reflect the overall market environment during 2024.

net ACL build for other assets was $200 million, primarily 
driven by transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia and 
Argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations 
under U.S. banking law. For additional information on Citi’s 
ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates” below.

For additional information on Markets’ corporate credit 

portfolio, see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—
Corporate Credit” below.

Fixed Income markets revenues decreased 6%. Rates and 

For additional information on trends in Markets’ deposits 

currencies revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by a 
decline in the currencies business, reflecting lower volatility, a 
strong prior-year comparison and a significant slowdown in 
activity in December 2023. The decline in rates and currencies 
revenues also reflected $526 million in translation losses in
revenues in Argentina due to the Argentine peso devaluations, 
including $236 million in translation loss in the fourth quarter 
of 2023. Spread products and other fixed income revenues 
decreased 5%, largely driven by lower client activity, lower 
volatility and a strong prior-year comparison.

Equity markets revenues decreased 9%, primarily due to a 

decline in equity derivatives, due to lower institutional 
activity, spread compression and lower volatility. Prime 
services revenues increased modestly, as prime finance 
balances grew, reflecting continued client momentum. 

Expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by investments 

in transformation, technology and other risk and controls, 
partially offset by productivity savings. 

Provisions were $437 million, compared to $155 million 

in the prior year, primarily driven by an ACL build in loans 
and other assets.

The net ACL build was $405 million, compared to $160 
million in the prior year. The ACL build for loans was $204 
million, primarily driven by risks and uncertainties impacting 
vulnerable industries, including commercial real estate. The 

and loans, see “Managing Global Risk—Liquidity Risk—
Loans” and “—Deposits” below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Markets’ future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global 
Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” and “—
Russia” below.

2022 vs. 2021
Net income of $5.9 billion decreased 11%, primarily driven by 
higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by 
higher revenues.

Revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by higher Fixed 

Income markets revenues, partially offset by lower Equity 
markets revenues and the impact of business actions taken to 
reduce RWA.

Fixed Income markets revenues increased 10%. Rates and 

currencies revenues increased 31%, reflecting increased 
market volatility, driven by rising interest rates and 
quantitative tightening, as central banks responded to elevated 
levels of inflation. Spread products and other fixed income 
revenues decreased 25%, due to continued lower client 
activity across spread products and a challenging credit market 
due to widening spreads for most of the year. The decline in 
spread products and other fixed income revenues was partially 

18

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
offset by strength in commodities, particularly with corporate 
clients, as the business assisted those clients in managing risk 
associated with the increased volatility.

Equity markets revenues decreased 12%, driven by equity 

derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity by both 
corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong prior 
year. The lower revenues also reflected a decline in equity 
cash, driven by lower client activity.

Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by volume-
related costs and investment in transformation, technology and 
other risk and controls.

Provisions were $155 million, compared to a benefit of 

$329 million in the prior year, driven by a net ACL build, 
partially offset by lower net credit losses.

Net credit losses were a benefit of $5 million, compared 

to $97 million in the prior year, largely driven by 
improvements in portfolio credit quality.

The net ACL build was $160 million, compared to a net 
release of $426 million in the prior year. The net ACL build 
was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic 
assumptions.

loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. Hedges 
on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of 
these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gain

The discussion of the results of operations for Banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of 
accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table 
above.

2023 vs. 2022
Net loss was $48 million, compared to net income of $386 
million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues 
and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. 
Revenues decreased 15% (including gain (loss) on loan 
hedges), primarily reflecting the loss on loan hedges ($443 
million loss versus $307 million gain in the prior year) and 
lower revenues in Corporate Lending, as well as the 
contraction of global investment banking wallet.

Investment Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by 
lower markdowns in non-investment-grade loan commitments. 
The increase in revenue was mainly offset by the overall 
decline in market wallet, as heightened macroeconomic 
uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. 
Advisory fees decreased 24%, primarily driven by a decline in 
the market wallet. Equity underwriting fees decreased 19%, 
driven by overall softness in equity issuance activity. Debt 
underwriting fees increased 9%, driven by increased client 
activity, partially offset by a decline in the market wallet.

Corporate Lending revenues decreased 30%, including the 

impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 4%, largely 
driven by lower volumes on continued balance sheet 
optimization. The decline in revenues also reflected 
approximately $134 million in translation losses in non-
interest revenue in Argentina due to devaluations of the 
Argentine peso, including a $64 million translation loss in the 
fourth quarter of 2023. 

Expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by the absence of 
an operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-
led investments and the impact of business-as-usual severance, 
partially offset by productivity savings.

Provisions reflected a benefit of $165 million, compared 

to a cost of $549 million in the prior year, driven by ACL 
releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments, partially 
offset by an ACL build in other assets.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to Banking’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global 
Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Argentina” and “—
Russia” below.

2022 vs. 2021
Net income of $386 million decreased 91%, primarily driven 
by lower revenues and higher cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 31% (including gain (loss) on loan 

hedges), primarily reflecting lower Investment Banking 
revenues, partially offset by an increase in Corporate Lending 
revenues and the gain on loan hedges ($307 million gain 
versus a $140 million loss in the prior year). 

Investment Banking revenues were down 59%, reflecting 

a significant decline in the overall market wallet, as well as 
markdowns on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. 
Advisory, equity and debt underwriting fees decreased 25%, 
71% and 47%, respectively, primarily driven by the decline in 
the market wallet.

Corporate Lending revenues increased 70%, including the 
impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of 
gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues increased 41%, primarily 
driven by higher revenue share from Investment Banking, 
Services and Markets, partially offset by lower volumes and 
higher hedging costs.

Expenses were up 1%, primarily driven by business-led 

investments, largely offset by an operational loss reserve 
release, productivity savings and lower volume-related 
expenses. 

Provisions were $549 million, compared to a benefit of 

$1.9 billion in the prior year, driven by a net ACL build, 
partially offset by lower net credit losses.

Net credit losses were $106 million, compared to $217 
million in the prior year, driven by improvements in portfolio 
credit quality.

Net credit losses increased to $169 million, compared to 

The net ACL build was $443 million, compared to a net 

release of $2.1 billion in the prior year. The net ACL build 
was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic 
assumptions.

$106 million in the prior year, driven by higher episodic write-
offs.

The net ACL release was $334 million, compared to a net 

build of $443 million in the prior year. The ACL releases in 
loans and unfunded lending commitments were driven by an 
improved macroeconomic outlook. These releases were 
partially offset by an ACL build in other assets, primarily 
related to transfer risk associated with exposures in Argentina 
and Russia, driven by safety and soundness considerations 
under U.S. banking law. For additional information on Citi’s 
ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates” below.

For additional information about trends, uncertainties and 

risks related to USPB’s future results, see “Executive 
Summary” above and “Risk Factors” below.

2022 vs. 2021
Net income was $2.8 billion, compared to $6.1 billion in the 
prior year, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, 
partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 6%, primarily due to higher net 
interest income (up 11%), driven by strong loan growth in 
Branded Cards and Retail Services and the impact of higher 
interest rates in Retail Banking. The increase in revenues was 
partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely 
reflecting higher partner payments in Retail Services resulting 
from higher revenues. 

Cards revenues increased 8%. Branded Cards revenues 
increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net interest income 
on higher loan balances. Branded Cards new account 
acquisitions increased 11% and card spend volumes increased 
16%. Average loans increased 11%, reflecting the higher card 
spend volumes.

Retail Services revenues increased 7%, primarily driven 

by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and 
lower card payment rates, partially offset by the increase in 
partner payments. The increase in partner payments reflected 
higher income sharing as a result of higher revenues. Retail 
Services card spend volumes increased 8% and average loans 
increased 6%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.

Retail Banking revenues decreased 2%, as the higher 
interest rates and modest deposit growth were more than offset 
by lower mortgage revenues due to fewer mortgage 
originations, driven by the higher interest rates. Average 
deposits increased 3%, largely reflecting higher levels of 
consumer liquidity in the first half of 2022. 

Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued 

investments in Citi’s transformation, other risk and control 
initiatives, volume-related expenses and business-led 
investments, partially offset by productivity savings.

Provisions were $3.4 billion, compared to a benefit of 
$1.0 billion in the prior year, largely driven by a net ACL 
build. Net credit losses decreased 1%, driven by historically 
low loss rates experienced in the first half of 2022, partially 
offset by higher losses in the second half of the year, 
particularly in Retail Services (net credit losses up 7% to $1.3 
billion). Branded Cards net credit losses declined 17% to $1.4 
billion. 

The net ACL build was $0.5 billion, compared to a net 
release of $3.9 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by 
U.S. cards loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic 
assumptions. 

2023 vs. 2022
Net income was $1.8 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the 
prior year, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, 
partially offset by higher revenues.

Revenues increased 14%, due to higher net interest 
income (up 12%), driven by strong loan growth and higher 
deposit spreads, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 
19%). The increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven 
by lower partner payments in Retail Services, due to higher 
net credit losses, and an increase in interchange fees, driven by 
higher card spend volumes in Branded Cards. The increase in 
non-interest revenue was partially offset by an increase in 
rewards costs in Branded Cards, driven by the higher card 
spend volumes.

Cards revenues increased 15%. Branded Cards revenues 

increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net interest 
income, reflecting the strong loan growth. Branded Cards new 
account acquisitions increased 9% and card spend volumes 
increased 5%. Branded Cards average loans increased 13%, 
reflecting the higher card spend volumes and lower card 
payment rates.

Retail Services revenues increased 21%, primarily driven 
by higher net interest income on higher loan balances, as well 
as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner 
payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see Note 5). 
Retail Services credit card spend volumes decreased 4% and 
average loans increased 9%, largely reflecting lower card 
payment rates.

Retail Banking revenues increased 6%, primarily driven 

by higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially 
offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and 
the associated deposit balances to Wealth. Average mortgage 
loans increased 16%, primarily driven by lower refinancings 
due to high interest rates and higher mortgage originations. 
Average deposits decreased 4%, largely reflecting the transfer 
of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to 
Wealth. 

Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued 
investments in other risk and controls, technology, business-
led investments and business-as-usual severance costs, 
partially offset by productivity savings.

Provisions were $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in 
the prior year, largely driven by higher net credit losses and a 
higher ACL build for loans. Net credit losses increased 79%, 
primarily reflecting higher losses in cards in line with
expectations, with Branded Cards net credit losses up 93% to 
$2.7 billion and Retail Services net credit losses up 84% to 
$2.3 billion. Both Branded Cards and Retail Services net 
credit losses reached pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023. 

The net ACL build was $1.5 billion, compared to $0.5 
billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting growth in loan 
balances in Branded Cards and Retail Services. For additional 
information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting 
Policies and Significant Estimates” below.

Includes assets under management, and trust and custody assets. 

2022 vs. 2021
Net income was $950 million, compared to $2.0 billion in the 
prior year, reflecting higher expenses, higher cost of credit and 
lower revenues.

Revenues decreased 1%, reflecting investment product 
revenue headwinds, particularly in Asia, driven by overall 
market volatility, partially offset by net interest income 
growth, driven by higher interest rates and higher loan and 
deposit volumes. Average loans increased 2% and average 
deposits increased 5%. Client balances decreased 7%, 
primarily driven by a decline in client investment assets. 

Private Bank revenues decreased 5%, primarily driven by 

the investment product revenue headwinds.

Wealth at Work revenues increased 6%, driven by 
improved lending spreads, primarily in mortgages, partially 
offset by lower deposit revenues. 

Citigold revenues increased 1%, primarily driven by 
higher deposit revenues, partially offset by lower investment 
revenues in Asia and North America due to lower client 
investment assets and client activity.

Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued 

investments in other risk and controls, technology and 
business-led investments, partially offset by productivity 
savings.

Provisions were $306 million, compared to a benefit of 
$226 million in the prior year, largely driven by a net ACL 
build. 

The net ACL build was $202 million, compared to a net 
release of $346 million in the prior year, primarily driven by 
deteriorations in macroeconomic assumptions.

2023 vs. 2022 
Net income was $346 million, compared to $950 million in the 
prior year, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses, 
partially offset by lower cost of credit.

Revenues decreased 5%, largely driven by lower net 
interest income (down 6%), due to lower deposit spreads, as 
well as lower non-interest revenue (down 3%), largely driven 
by investment product revenue headwinds, partially offset by 
the benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances from USPB. Average loans were 
largely unchanged. Average deposits decreased 1%, reflecting 
transfers to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform. 
Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher 
client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit 
balances. 

Private Bank revenues decreased 17%, primarily driven 

by lower deposit spreads, lower deposit and loan volumes and 
the investment product revenue headwinds.

Wealth at Work revenues increased 18%, driven by 
improved lending spreads, primarily in mortgages, and higher 
investment product revenues, partially offset by lower deposit 
revenues. 

Citigold revenues were largely unchanged, as higher 
deposit revenues internationally were offset by lower deposit 
revenues in North America and lower lending revenues 
globally.

Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued 

investments in other risk and controls and technology, 
partially offset by productivity savings and re-pacing of 
strategic investments.

Provisions were a benefit of $2 million, compared to 
provisions of $306 million in the prior year, largely driven by 
a net ACL release. 

The net ACL release was $97 million, compared to a net 

build of $202 million in the prior year, primarily driven by 
improvements in macroeconomic assumptions. For additional

ALL OTHER—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)

All Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments (Services, Markets, Banking, USPB and Wealth), 
including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other. For additional information about Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other, see “All 
Other (Managed Basis)” below.

All Other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the “Reconciling Items” column in the table below) 

related to (i) Citi’s divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned divestiture or IPO of Mexico consumer 
banking and small business and middle-market banking, within Legacy Franchises. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) results also 
exclude these divestiture-related impacts. Certain of the results of operations of All Other (managed basis) and Legacy Franchises 
(managed basis) are non-GAAP financial measures (see “Overview—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above).

The table below presents a reconciliation from All Other (U.S. GAAP) to All Other (managed basis). All Other (U.S. GAAP), less 

Reconciling Items, equals All Other (managed basis). The Reconciling Items are fully reflected on each respective line item in Citi’s

ALL OTHER—Managed Basis

At December 31, 2023, All Other (managed basis) had $211 billion in assets, primarily related to Mexico Consumer/SBMM and Asia 
Consumer reported within Legacy Franchises (managed basis), as well as Corporate Treasury investment securities and the 
Company’s deferred tax assets (DTAs) reported within Corporate/Other.

Legacy Franchises (Managed Basis)
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) includes (i) Mexico Consumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and 
Middle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico Consumer/SBMM, (ii) Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), 
representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining four exit countries (Korea, Poland, China and Russia), and (iii) Legacy 
Holdings Assets, primarily legacy consumer mortgage loans in North America that the Company continues to wind down. 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM operates in Mexico through Citibanamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card 
products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial 
customers. As previously disclosed, Citi intends to pursue an IPO of its consumer, small business and middle-market banking 
operations in Mexico. Citi will retain its Services, Markets, Banking and Wealth businesses in Mexico. Citi currently expects that the 
separation of the businesses will be completed in the second half of 2024 and that the IPO will take place in 2025.

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) also included the following nine Asia Consumer businesses prior to their sales: Australia, 

until its closing in June 2022; the Philippines, until its closing in August 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings in 
November 2022; Bahrain, until its closing in December 2022; India and Vietnam, until their closings in March 2023; Taiwan, until its 
closing in August 2023; and Indonesia until its closing in November 2023. 

Citi has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in China, Korea and Russia. In October 2023, Citi announced the signing 

of an agreement to sell its onshore consumer wealth business in China and has restarted the sales process of its consumer banking 
business in Poland. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. 
For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see “Risk Factors” and 
“Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.

At December 31, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had 1,344 retail branches, $20 billion in retail 

banking loans and $52 billion in deposits. In addition, Legacy Franchises (managed basis) had $9 billion in outstanding card loan 
balances, while Mexico SBMM had $8 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. 

Corporate/Other
Corporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and 
compliance-related costs), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses and income taxes, as

2023 vs. 2022
Net loss was $2.1 billion, compared to net income of $163 
million in the prior year, driven by higher expenses (largely 
related to the FDIC special assessment and Citi’s restructuring 
charge) and higher cost of credit. The higher expenses and 
cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the 
prior-year release of CTA losses (net of hedges) from AOCI, 
consisting of approximately $140 million recorded in revenues 
and approximately $260 million pretax recorded in 
discontinued operations, related to the substantial liquidation 
of a U.K. consumer legacy operation (see Note 2).

All Other (managed basis) revenues increased 4%, driven 

by higher revenues in Corporate/Other, partially offset by 
lower revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis). 

2022 vs. 2021
Net income was $163 million, compared to net income of $1.0 
billion in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues, 
higher cost of credit and the release of the CTA losses (net of 
hedges) from AOCI.

All Other (managed basis) revenues decreased 5%, driven 
by lower revenues in Legacy Franchises (managed basis), and 
lower non-interest revenue in Corporate/Other, partially offset 
by higher net interest income in Corporate/Other. 

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 
14%, primarily driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset 
by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed 
basis).

Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 

increased 2%, as cards revenues in Mexico Consumer 
increased 6% and SBMM revenues increased 10%, primarily 
due to higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan 
growth. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a 1% 
decrease in retail banking revenues, primarily driven by lower 
fiduciary fees reflecting declines in equity market valuations.

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 25%, 

primarily driven by the loss of revenues from the closing of 
the exit markets and the impacts of the ongoing Korea wind-
down. 

Legacy Holdings Assets revenues of $(81) million 
decreased from $186 million in the prior year, largely driven 
by the CTA loss (net of hedges) recorded in AOCI, as well as 
the continued wind-down of Legacy Holdings Assets.

Corporate/Other revenues were $1.5 billion, compared to 

$825 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest 
income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. The 
higher net interest income was primarily due to the investment 
portfolio driven by higher balances, higher interest rates and 
lower mortgage-backed securities prepayments, partially offset 
by higher cost of funds related to higher institutional 
certificates of deposit. The lower non-interest revenue was 
primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains in the 
prior year as well as higher hedging costs.

Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower 
consulting expenses, the impact of certain legal settlements 
and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets. 

Provisions were $498 million, compared to a benefit of 
$88 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a lower net 
ACL release, partially offset by lower net credit losses. Net 
credit losses decreased 48%, primarily reflecting improved 
delinquencies in both Asia Consumer and Mexico Consumer. 
The net ACL release was $368 million, compared to a net 
ACL release of $1.7 billion in the prior year, driven by further 
improvement in portfolio credit quality. 

4%, primarily driven by lower revenues in Asia Consumer 
(managed basis), partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico 
Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).

Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis) revenues 

increased 23%, as cards revenues in Mexico Consumer 
increased 31%, SBMM revenues increased 28% and retail 
banking revenues increased 19%, mainly due to the benefit of 
FX translation as well as higher interest rates and higher 
deposit and loan growth. 

Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 48%, 

primarily driven by the reduction from exited markets and 
wind-downs. 

Corporate/Other revenues were $2.2 billion, compared to 

$1.5 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest 
income. The higher net interest income was primarily due to 
higher interest rates on deposits with banks and the investment 
portfolio, partially offset by higher cost of funds.

Expenses increased 22%, primarily driven by the $1.7 

billion FDIC special assessment related to regional bank 
failures, restructuring charges and higher business-as-usual 
severance costs, partially offset by lower consulting expenses 
and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets. The 
restructuring charges were recorded in the fourth quarter and 
primarily consisted of severance costs associated with 
headcount reductions related to the organizational 
simplification initiatives (see Note 9). 

Provisions were $1.3 billion, compared to $498 million in 
the prior year, driven by a higher net ACL build for loans and 
other assets and higher net credit losses. Net credit losses 
increased 13%, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in 
Mexico Consumer.

The net ACL build for loans was $106 million, compared 

to a net release of $368 million in the prior year, primarily 
driven by higher lending volumes in Mexico Consumer. The 
net ACL build in other assets was primarily due to the reserve 
build for transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia, 
driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. 
banking law. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see 
“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” 
below.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK 

Overview
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance 
to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi has established an 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to ensure 
that all of Citi’s risks are managed appropriately and 
consistently across the Company and at an aggregate, 
enterprise-wide level. Citi’s culture drives a strong risk and 
control environment, and is at the heart of the ERM 
Framework, underpinning the way Citi conducts business. The 
activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities 
generate, must be consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value 
Proposition (see below) and the key Leadership Principles that 
support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. As discussed above, 
Citi also continues its efforts to comply with the FRB and 
OCC consent orders, relating principally to various aspects of 
risk management, compliance, data quality management and 
governance, and internal controls (see “Citi’s Consent Order 
Compliance” and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” above).
Under Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition, which was 
developed by its senior leadership and distributed throughout 
the Company, Citi strives to serve its clients as a trusted 
partner by responsibly providing financial services that enable 
growth and economic progress while earning and maintaining 
the public’s trust by constantly adhering to the highest ethical 
standards. As such, Citi asks all colleagues to ensure that their 
decisions pass three tests: they are in Citi’s clients’ best 
interests, create economic value and are always systemically 
responsible. 

As discussed in “Human Capital Resources and 

Management” above, Citi has designed Leadership Principles 
that represent the qualities, behaviors and expectations all 
employees must exhibit to deliver on Citi’s mission of 
enabling growth and economic progress. The Leadership 
Principles inform Citi’s ERM Framework and contribute to 
creating a culture that drives client, control and operational 
excellence. Citi colleagues share a common responsibility to 
uphold these Leadership Principles and hold themselves to the 
highest standards of ethics and professional behavior in 
dealing with Citi’s clients, business colleagues, shareholders, 
communities and each other.

Citi’s ERM Framework details the principles used to 
support effective enterprise-wide risk management across the 
end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The ERM Framework 
covers the risk management roles and responsibilities of the 
Citigroup Board of Directors (the Board), Citi’s Executive 
Management Team (see “Risk Governance—Executive 
Management Team” below) and employees across the lines of 
defense. The underlying pillars of the framework encompass:

•

•

Culture—the core principles and behaviors that underpin 
a strong culture of risk awareness, in line with Citi’s 
Mission and Value Proposition, and Leadership 
Principles;
Governance—the committee structure and reporting 
arrangements that support the appropriate oversight of 
risk management activities at the Board and Executive 
Management Team levels and establishes Citi’s Lines of 
Defense model;

68

•

•

Risk Management—the end-to-end risk management 
cycle including the identification, measurement, 
monitoring, controlling and reporting of all risks 
including top, material, growing, idiosyncratic and 
emerging risks, and aggregated to an enterprise-wide 
level; and
Enterprise Programs—the key risk management 
programs performed across the risk management lifecycle 
for all risk categories.

Each of these pillars is underpinned by supporting 
capabilities covering people, infrastructure and tools that are 
in place to enable the execution of the ERM Framework.

Citi’s approach to risk management requires that its risk-
taking be consistent with its risk appetite. Risk appetite is the 
aggregate level of risk that Citi is willing to tolerate in order to 
achieve its strategic objectives and business plan. Risk limits 
and thresholds represent allocations of Citi’s risk appetite to 
businesses and risk categories. Concentration risks are 
controlled through a subset of these limits and thresholds.

Citi’s risks are generally categorized and summarized as 

follows:

•

•

Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality (or downgrade risk) or failure of a borrower, 
counterparty, third party or issuer to honor its financial or 
contractual obligations.
Liquidity risk is the risk that Citi will not be able to 
efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and 
future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely 
affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of 
Citi. Risk may be exacerbated by the inability of the 
Company to access funding sources or monetize assets 
and the composition of liability funding and liquid assets.

•

• Market risk (Trading and Non-Trading): Market risk of 
trading portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes 
in the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from 
changes in market variables, such as interest rates, equity 
and commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or credit 
spreads. Market risk of non-trading portfolios is the 
impact of adverse changes in market variables such as 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and 
equity prices on Citi’s net interest income, economic 
value of equity, or AOCI. 
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and 
systems, or from external events. It includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, 
settlements and regulatory fines) resulting from Citi’s 
failure to comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical 
standards or contractual obligations in any aspect of Citi’s 
business, but excludes strategic and reputation risks (see 
below).
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected 
financial condition and resilience arising from violations 
of laws, rules or regulations, or from non-conformance 
with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures 
or ethical standards. 
Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
conditions and resilience from negative opinion held by 

•

•

•

stakeholders. This risk may impair Citi’s competitiveness 
by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or 
services or continue servicing existing relationships.
Strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact (not 
episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives as 
measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization or capital, arising from the external factors 
affecting the Company’s operating environment; as well 
as the risks associated with defining the strategy and 
executing the strategy, which are identified, measured and 
managed as part of the Strategic Risk Framework at the 
Enterprise Level.

Citi uses a lines of defense model as a key component of 
its ERM Framework to manage its risks. As discussed below, 
the lines of defense model brings together risk-taking, risk 
oversight and risk assurance under one umbrella and provides 
an avenue for risk accountability of the first line of defense, a 
construct for effective challenge by the second line of defense 
(Independent Risk Management and Independent Compliance 
Risk Management), and empowers independent risk assurance 
by the third line of defense (Internal Audit). In addition, the 
lines of defense model includes organizational units tasked 
with supporting a strong control environment (“enterprise 
support functions”). The first, second and third lines of 
defense, along with enterprise support functions, have distinct 
roles and responsibilities and are empowered to perform 
relevant risk management processes and responsibilities in 
order to manage Citi’s risks in a consistent and effective 
manner.

First Line of Defense: Front Line Units and Front Line 
Unit Activities
Citi’s first line of defense owns the risks and associated 
controls inherent in, or arising from, the execution of its 
business activities and is responsible for identifying, 
measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting those risks 
consistent with Citi’s strategy, Mission and Value Proposition, 
Leadership Principles and risk appetite. 

Front line units are responsible and held accountable for 
managing the risks associated with their activities within the 
boundaries set by independent risk management. They are also 
responsible for designing and implementing effective internal 
controls and maintaining processes for managing their risk 
profile, including through risk mitigation, so that it remains 
consistent with Citi’s established risk appetite.

Front line unit activities are considered part of the first 

line of defense and are subject to the oversight and challenge 
of independent risk management. 

The first line of defense is composed of Citi’s operating 

segments (i.e., Services, Markets, Banking, U.S. Personal 
Banking, Wealth), as well as Client, Legacy Franchises and 
certain corporate functions (i.e., Chief Operating Office, 
Enterprise Services and Public Affairs, Finance, Operations 
and Technology). In addition, the first line of defense includes 
the front line unit activities of other organizational units. Front 
line units may also include enterprise support units and/or 
conduct enterprise support activities—see “Enterprise Support 
Functions” below.

Second Line of Defense: Independent Risk Management 
Independent risk management units are independent of the 
first line of defense. They are responsible for overseeing the 
risk-taking activities of the first line of defense and 
challenging the first line of defense in the execution of its risk 
management responsibilities. They are also responsible for 
independently identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling 
and reporting aggregate risks and for setting standards for the 
management and oversight of risk. Independent risk 
management is composed of Independent Risk Management 
(IRM) and Independent Compliance Risk Management 
(ICRM), which are led by the Group Chief Risk Officer 
(CRO) and Group Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) who have 
unrestricted access to the Board and its Risk Management 
Committee to facilitate the ability to execute their specific 
responsibilities pertaining to escalation to the Board.

Independent Risk Management
The IRM organization sets risk and control standards for the 
first line of defense and actively manages and oversees 
aggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity, 
strategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi, 
including risks that span categories, such as concentration risk, 
country risk and climate risk. 

IRM is organized to align to risk categories, legal entities/
regions and Company-wide, cross-risk functions or processes. 
Each of these units reports to a member of the Risk 
Management Executive Council, who are all direct reports to 
the Citigroup CRO.

Independent Compliance Risk Management 
The ICRM organization actively oversees compliance risk 
across Citi, sets compliance standards for the first line of 
defense to manage compliance risk and promotes business 
conduct and activity that is consistent with Citi’s Mission and 
Value Proposition and the compliance risk appetite. Citi’s 
objective is to embed an enterprise-wide compliance risk 
management framework and culture that identifies, measures, 
monitors, controls and escalates compliance risk across Citi. 

ICRM is aligned by product line, function and geography 

to provide compliance risk management advice and credible 
challenge on day-to-day matters and strategic decision-making 
for key initiatives. ICRM also has program-level Enterprise 
Compliance units responsible for setting standards and 
establishing priorities for program-related compliance efforts. 
The CCO reports to Citi’s General Counsel and ICRM is 
organizationally part of the Global Legal Affairs & 
Compliance group. In addition, the CCO has matrix reporting 
into the CRO and is part of the Risk Management Executive 
Council.

Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit
Internal Audit is independent of the first line, second line and 
enterprise support functions. The role of Internal Audit is to 
provide independent, objective, reliable, valued and timely 
assurance to the Board, its Audit Committee, Citi senior 
management and regulators over the effectiveness of 
governance, risk management and controls that mitigate 
current and evolving risks and enhance the control culture 
within Citi. The Citi Chief Auditor manages Internal Audit 

69

and reports functionally to the Chair of the Citi Audit 
Committee and administratively to the Citi Chief Executive 
Officer. The Citi Chief Auditor has unrestricted access to the 
Board and the Board Audit Committee to address risks and 
issues identified through Internal Audit’s activities. 

Enterprise Support Functions
Enterprise support functions engage in activities that support 
safety and soundness across Citi. These functions provide 
advisory services and/or design, implement, maintain and 
oversee Company-wide programs that support Citi in 
maintaining an effective control environment. 

Enterprise support functions are composed of Human 

Resources and Global Legal Affairs and Compliance 
(exclusive of ICRM, which is part of the second line of 
defense). Front line units may also include enterprise support 
units and/or conduct enterprise support activities (e.g., the 
Controllers Group within Finance). 

Enterprise support functions, units and activities are 
subject to the relevant Company-wide independent oversight 
processes specific to the risks for which they are accountable 
(e.g., operational risk, compliance risk, reputation risk).

Risk Governance
Citi’s ERM Framework encompasses risk management 
processes to address risks undertaken by Citi through 
identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and 
reporting of all risks. The ERM Framework integrates these 
processes with appropriate governance to complement Citi’s 
commitment to maintaining strong and consistent risk 
management practices.

Board Oversight
The Board is responsible for oversight of Citi and holds the 
Executive Management Team accountable for implementing 
the ERM Framework and meeting strategic objectives within 
Citi’s risk appetite.

Executive Management Team
The Citigroup CEO directs and oversees the day-to-day 
management of Citi as delegated by the Board of Directors. 
The CEO leads the Company through the Executive 
Management Team and provides oversight of group activities, 
both directly and through authority delegated to committees 
established to oversee the management of risk, to ensure 
continued alignment with Citi’s risk strategy.

Board and Executive Management Committees
The Board executes its responsibilities either directly or 
through its committees. The Board has delegated authority to 
the following Board standing committees to help fulfill its 
oversight and risk management responsibilities:

•

Risk Management Committee (RMC): assists the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibility with respect to (i) oversight of 
Citi’s risk management framework and risk culture, 
including the significant policies and practices used in 
managing credit, market (trading and non-trading), 
liquidity, strategic, operational, compliance, reputation 
and certain other risks, including those pertaining to 

•

•

•

•

capital management, and (ii) oversight of the Global Risk 
Review—credit, capital and collateral review functions.
Audit Committee: provides oversight of Citi’s financial 
and regulatory reporting and internal control risk, as well 
as Internal Audit and Citi’s external independent 
accountants.
Compensation, Performance Management and Culture 
Committee: provides oversight of compensation of Citi’s 
employees and Citi management’s sustained focus on 
fostering a principled culture of sound ethics, responsible 
conduct and accountability within the organization.
Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee: 
responsible for (i) identifying individuals qualified to 
become Board members and recommending to the Board 
the director nominees for the next annual meeting of 
stockholders, (ii) leading the Board in its annual review of 
the Board’s performance, (iii) recommending to the Board 
directors for each committee for appointment by the 
Board, (iv) reviewing the Company’s policies and 
programs that relate to public issues of significance to the 
Company and the public at large, including but not 
limited to Environmental, Social and Corporate 
Governance (ESG) matters and (v) reviewing the 
Company’s relationships with external constituencies and 
issues that impact the Company’s reputation, and advising 
management as to its approach to each.
Technology Committee: assists the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibility with respect to oversight of (i) the planning 
and execution of Citigroup’s technology, strategy and 
operating plan, (ii) the development of Citi’s target state 
operating model and architecture, including the 
incorporation of Global Business Services, (iii) 
technology-based risk management, including risk 
management framework, risk appetite and risk exposures 
of the Company, (iv) resource and talent planning of the 
Technology function and (v) the Company’s third-party 
management policies, practices and standards that relate 
to Technology.

In addition to the above, the Board has established the 

following ad hoc committee: 

•

Transformation Oversight Committee: provides oversight 
of the actions of Citi’s management to develop and 
execute a transformation of Citi’s risk and control 
environment pursuant to the FRB and OCC consent 
orders (see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

The Citigroup CEO has established four standing 
committees that cover the primary risks to which Citi (i.e., 
Group) is exposed. These consist of:

•

Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC): the 
primary senior executive level committee responsible for 
(i) overseeing the execution of Citigroup’s ERM 
Framework, (ii) monitoring Citi’s risk profile at an 
aggregate level inclusive of individual risk categories, (iii) 
ensuring that Citi’s risk profile remains consistent with its 
approved risk appetite and (iv) discussing material and 
emerging risk issues facing the Company. The Committee 
also provides comprehensive Group-wide coverage of all 

70

 
•

•

•

risk categories, including Credit Risk, Market Risk 
(trading) and Strategic Risk.
Citigroup Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO): 
responsible for governance over management’s Liquidity 
Risk and Market Risk (non-trading) management and for 
monitoring and influencing the balance sheet, investment 
securities and capital management activities of Citigroup.
Group Business Risk and Control Committee (GBRCC): 
provides governance oversight of Citi’s Compliance and 
Operational Risks. 
Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC): provides 
governance oversight for Reputation Risk management 
across Citi.

In addition to the Executive Management committees 
listed above, management may establish ad-hoc committees in 
response to regulatory feedback or to manage additional 
activities when deemed necessary.

Consumer Credit Portfolio” below.

End-of-period loans increased 5% year-over-year, largely 

reflecting growth in cards in USPB. End-of-period loans 
increased 3% sequentially.

On an average basis, loans increased 3% year-over-year 
and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was largely 
due to growth in USPB, Services and Markets, partially offset 
by a decline in Banking. 

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, average loans for: 

•

USPB increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in 
Branded Cards, Retail Banking and Retail Services. 

• Wealth were largely unchanged. 
•

Services increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by 
strong demand for working capital loans in TTS in North 
America and internationally. 

• Markets increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting increased 

•

client demand in warehouse lending. 
Banking decreased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven 
by capital optimization efforts. 

CREDIT RISK 

Overview
Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in 
credit quality of a client, customer or counterparty (or 
downgrade risk) or the failure of a borrower, counterparty, 
third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual 
obligations. Credit risk is one of the most significant risks Citi 
faces as an institution (see “Risk Factors—Credit Risks” 
above). Credit risk arises in many of Citigroup’s business 
activities, including:

•
•
•
•

consumer, commercial and corporate lending; 
capital markets derivative transactions; 
structured finance; and 
securities financing transactions (repurchase and reverse 
repurchase agreements, and securities loaned and 
borrowed).

Credit risk also arises from clearing and settlement 
activities, when Citi transfers an asset in advance of receiving 
its counter-value or advances funds to settle a transaction on 
behalf of a client. Concentration risk, within credit risk, is the 
risk associated with having credit exposure concentrated 
within a specific client, industry, region or other category.

Citi has an established framework in place for managing 

credit risk across all businesses that includes a defined risk 
appetite, credit limits and credit policies. Citi’s credit risk 
management framework also includes policies and procedures 
to manage problem exposures.

To manage concentration risk, Citi has in place a 
framework consisting of industry limits, single-name 
concentrations for each business and across Citigroup and a 
specialized product limit framework.

Credit exposures are generally reported in notional terms 

for accrual loans, reflecting the value at which the loans as 
well as other off-balance sheet commitments are carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit exposure arising from 
capital markets activities is generally expressed as the current 
mark-to-market, net of margin, reflecting the net value owed 
to Citi by a given counterparty. 

The credit risk associated with Citi’s credit exposures is a 
function of the idiosyncratic creditworthiness of the obligor, as 
well as the terms and conditions of the specific obligation. Citi 
assesses the credit risk associated with its credit exposures on 
a regular basis through its allowance for credit losses (ACL) 
process (see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant 
Estimates—Allowance for Credit Losses” below and Notes 1 
and 16), as well as through regular stress testing at the 
company, business, geography and product levels. These 
stress-testing processes typically estimate potential 
incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either 
downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or 
counterparties. See Note 15 for additional information on 
Citi’s credit risk management.

CORPORATE CREDIT
Consistent with its overall strategy, Citi’s corporate clients are 
typically corporations that value the depth and breadth of 
Citi’s global network. Citi aims to establish relationships with 
these clients whose needs encompass multiple products, 
including cash management and trade services, foreign 
exchange, lending, capital markets and M&A advisory.

Corporate Credit Portfolio
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio within Services, Markets, Banking and the Mexico SBMM component of 
All Other—Legacy Franchises (excluding loans carried at fair value and loans held-for-sale), and before consideration of collateral or 
hedges, by remaining tenor for the periods indicated:

The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings 
across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison 
of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographic 
regions and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an 
estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and 
internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated 
statistical models and scorecards in combination with 
consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such 
as management experience, competitive position, regulatory 
environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are 
assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor 
and factors that affect the loss given default of the facility, 
such as support or collateral. Internal obligor ratings that 
generally correspond to BBB and above are considered 
investment grade, while those below are considered non-
investment grade.

The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio 

by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate 
credit portfolio:

Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending 
commitments. 

In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned 

to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate 
credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s 
interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of 
criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as 
special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.

Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and 
adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and 
non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or 
changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic 
environment.

73

 
 
 
Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be 

appropriately rated and classified as of December 31, 2023. 
Citi has taken action to adjust internal ratings and 
classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic 
environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, 
particularly where additional stress has been seen. 

As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of 

default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to 
result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, 
appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and 
downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit 
derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the 
incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi’s seeking to 
reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will 
continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate 
probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.
See Note 15 for additional information on Citi’s corporate 

credit portfolio.

Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of December 31, 2023, Citi’s total credit exposure to 
commercial real estate (CRE) was $66 billion, including $8 
billion of exposure related to office buildings. This total CRE 
exposure consisted of approximately $55 billion related to 
corporate clients, included in the real estate category in the 
table above, and approximately $11 billion related to Wealth 
clients that is not in the table above as they are not considered 
corporate exposures. 

In addition, as of December 31, 2023, approximately 80% 

of Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and 
more than 77% was to borrowers in the U.S.

As of December 31, 2023, the ACLL attributed to the 
total funded CRE exposure (including the Private Bank) was 
approximately 1.49%, and there were $759 million of non-
accrual CRE loans.

Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup 
uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other 
risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk 
in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset 
sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic 
hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic 
feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The 
results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses 
on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in Principal 
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
At December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and 
December 31, 2022, Banking had economic hedges on the 
corporate credit portfolio of $35.9 billion, $36.0 billion and 
$39.8 billion, respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model 
used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the 
favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that 
are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of 
direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the 
tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging 
transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging 
underlying Banking corporate credit portfolio exposures with 
the following risk rating distribution:

CONSUMER CREDIT
Citi's consumer credit risk management framework is designed 
for a variety of environments. Underwriting and portfolio 
management policies are calibrated based on risk-return trade-
offs by product and segment and changes are made based on 
performance against benchmarks as well as environmental 
stress. As warranted, Citi adjusts underwriting criteria to 
address consumer credit risks and macroeconomic challenges 
and uncertainties.

USPB provides credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, 
small business banking and retail banking, and Wealth offers 
wealth management lending and other products globally that 
range from the affluent to ultra-high net worth customer 
segments through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and

Consumer Credit Trends

U.S. Personal Banking

Branded Cards

As indicated above, USPB provides card products through 
Branded Cards and Retail Services, and mortgages and home 
equity, small business and personal consumer loans through 
Citi’s Retail Banking network. Retail Banking is concentrated 
in six major U.S. metropolitan areas. USPB also provides 
mortgages through correspondent channels.

As of December 31, 2023, approximately 79% of USPB 

EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services 
card loans, which generally drives the overall credit 
performance of USPB, as U.S. cards net credit losses 
represented approximately 96% of total USPB net credit losses 
for the fourth quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, 
Branded Cards represented 67% of total U.S. cards EOP loans 
and Retail Services represented 33% of U.S. cards EOP loans.

As presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
USPB increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, 
largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, 
primarily reflecting normalization to pre-pandemic levels in 
Branded Cards and Retail Services as well as the impact of 
macroeconomic pressures related to the higher inflationary 
and interest rate environment. Citi expects the net credit loss 
rate for both Branded Cards and Retail Services to continue to 
rise above pre-pandemic levels and, on a full-year basis, peak 
in 2024. The higher net credit losses expectation is already 
reflected in the Company’s ACL on loans for outstanding 
balances at December 31, 2023.

USPB’s Branded Cards portfolio includes proprietary and 

co-branded cards. 

As presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Branded Cards increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, 
primarily reflecting normalization to pre-pandemic levels as 
well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the 
higher inflationary and interest rate environment.

Retail Services

USPB’s Retail Services partners directly with more than 
20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded 
cards. Retail Services’ target market focuses on select industry 
segments such as home improvement, specialty retail, 
consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually 
evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries 
that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and 
growth potential.

As presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in 
Retail Services increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-
year, largely driven by a continued increase in net flow rates, 
primarily reflecting normalization to pre-pandemic levels as 
well as the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the 
higher inflationary and interest rate environment.

delinquency and other information for Citi’s cards portfolios,

Note 15.

risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 85% is rated 
investment grade. While the delinquency rate in the chart 
above is calculated only for the delinquency-managed 
portfolio, the net credit loss rate is calculated using net credit 
losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed 
portfolios.

As presented in the chart above, the net credit loss rate 

and 90+ days past due delinquency rate in Wealth for the 
fourth quarter of 2023 were broadly stable quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year. The low net credit loss and the 
90+ days past due delinquency rates continued to reflect the 
strong credit profiles of the portfolios. 

Mexico Consumer

Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through 

Citibanamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages 
and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer 
serves a more mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on 
developing multiproduct relationships with customers.

As presented in the chart above, the fourth quarter of 2023 

net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-
over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily driven by the 
ongoing normalization of loss rates from post-pandemic lows. 
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was relatively 

stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 

For additional information on cost of credit, loan 
delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan 
portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations 
above and Note 15.

Retail Banking

USPB’s Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of 

consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured 
lending products, such as small business loans and personal 
loans. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where 
Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies 
and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer 
mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to 
high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value 
ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second 
mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-to-Value 
(LTV) Ratios” in Note 15.

As presented in the chart above, the net credit loss rate in 

Retail Banking for the fourth quarter of 2023 was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by the growth and seasoning of personal 
loans.

The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly 
stable quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year, 
primarily driven by lower delinquencies in U.S. mortgages.

Wealth

As indicated above, Wealth provides consumer 

mortgages, margin lending, cards and other lending products 
to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net 
worth through the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold. 
These customer segments represent a target market that is 
characterized by historically low default rates and 
delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency 
managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed 
portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and 
cards. 

As of December 31, 2023, approximately $46 billion, or 
30%, of the portfolio was classifiably managed and primarily 
consisted of margin lending, commercial real estate, 
subscription credit finance and other lending programs. These 
classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit

net credit loss and delinquency rates. The FICO distribution 
continued to reflect strong underlying credit quality of the 
portfolios. See Note 15 for additional information on FICO 
scores.

(1) End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2) The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the 

potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) 
were $63 million ($0.5 billion), $89 million ($0.6 billion) and $185 million ($1.1 billion) at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts 
excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $73 million, 
$70 million and $74 million at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail Services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit 

card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.

(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios.
(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and 
therefore delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 85%, 96% and 94% of Wealth classifiably managed loans 
were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see “Consumer 
Credit Trends” above.

(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and Russia for all periods presented and in Bahrain for 2021 only.
(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia Consumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these businesses have been reclassified as HFS in 

Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related delinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The reclassifications 
commenced as follows: Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22 (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and 
Vietnam closed in 1Q23; Taiwan closed in 3Q23; and Indonesia closed in 4Q23); Australia in 3Q21 (closed in 2Q22); and the Philippines in 4Q21 (closed in 
3Q22). In addition, a portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 and subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 2.

(9) The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. 
government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and 
(EOP loans) were $67 million ($0.2 billion), $90 million ($0.3 billion) and $138 million ($0.4 billion) at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 
amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $36 
million, $37 million and $35 million at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

(3) All Other (managed basis) excludes divestiture-related impacts (Reconciling Items) related to (i) Citi’s divestitures of its Asia Consumer businesses and (ii) the

planned divestiture of Mexico consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking within Legacy Franchises. The Reconciling Items are fully 
reflected in the various line items in Citi’s Consolidated Statement of Income. See “All Other—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.

(4) Asia Consumer also includes NCLs and average loans in Poland and Russia for all periods presented and in Bahrain for 2021 only.
(5) Approximately $25 million, $155 million and $6 million in NCLs relating to certain Asia Consumer businesses classified as held-for-sale in Other assets and 

Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were recorded as a reduction in revenue (Other revenue) in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accordingly, 
these NCLs are not included in this table. See footnote 3 to this table.

(1)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America. The classification of corporate loans between 

offices in North America and outside North America is based on the domicile of the booking unit. The difference between the domicile of the booking unit and the 
domicile of the managing unit is not material.

and 2019, respectively. Unearned income on consumer loans primarily represents loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, that are deferred and 
recognized as Interest income over the lives of the related loans. 

(4)  Corporate loans include Mexico SBMM loans and are net of unearned income of $(917) million, $(797) million, $(770) million, $(787) million and $(763) million 
at December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unearned income on corporate loans primarily represents loan origination fees, net of certain 
direct origination costs, that are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the lives of the related loans. 
(5)  Because loans carried at fair value do not have an ACLL, they are excluded from the ACLL ratio calculation.

(1) On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): TDRs and Vintage 

Disclosures. The ASU eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the ACLL for TDRs using a 
discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. On January 1, 2023, Citi recorded a $352 million decrease in the Allowance for loan losses, along with a $290 million 
after-tax increase to Retained earnings. See Note 1.

(2) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (CECL). The ASC introduces a new credit 
loss methodology requiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also providing additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi recorded a 
$4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a 
deferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due to longer estimated tenors than under the 
incurred loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries, and (ii) a $0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter remaining tenors, 
incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. 

(3) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable post-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded as an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening

allowance for credit losses on loans of $443 million.
Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses, such as changes in the allowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX translation, 
purchase accounting adjustments, etc.
2023 includes an approximate $175 million increase related to FX translation.
2022 includes an approximate $350 million reclass related to the announced sales of Citi’s consumer banking businesses in Thailand, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, 
Indonesia, Bahrain and Vietnam. Also includes a decrease of approximately $100 million related to FX translation.
2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business and an approximate $90 million 
reclass related to Citi’s agreement to sell its Philippines consumer banking business. Those ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021 also 
includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related to FX translation.
2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios. In addition, 2020 includes an increase of 
approximately $97 million related to FX translation.
2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million related to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan portfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of 
approximately $60 million related to FX translation.

(10) December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 exclude $7.6 billion, $5.4 billion, $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of loans that are carried 

at fair value.

(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(12) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees. The reserves on these contracts were 

reclassified out of the ACL on unfunded lending commitments and into Other liabilities.

(13) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio and troubled debt restructurings. See 

“Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates.” Attribution of the ACLL is made for analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is available to 
absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio. Prior to 2020, the ACLL represented management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as 
probable losses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs.

(2)

Includes both Branded Cards and Retail Services. As of December 31, 2023, the $12.6 billion of ACLL represented approximately 25 months of coincident net 
credit loss coverage (based on 4Q23 NCLs). As of December 31, 2023, Branded Cards ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 6.0% and Retail Services ACLL 
as a percentage of EOP loans was 11.1%. As of December 31, 2022, the $11.4 billion of ACLL represented approximately 43 months of coincident net credit loss 
coverage (based on 4Q22 NCLs). The decrease in the coincident coverage ratio at December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the higher levels of NCLs in 4Q23 
versus 4Q22. As of December 31, 2022, Branded Cards ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans was 6.2% and Retail Services ACLL as a percentage of EOP loans 
was 10.3%.
Includes residential mortgages, retail loans and personal, small business and other loans, including those extended through the Private Bank network.

Non-Accrual Loans and Assets
There is a certain amount of overlap among non-accrual loans 
and assets. The following summary provides a general 
description of each category:

•

•

•

•

•

Corporate and consumer (including commercial banking) 
non-accrual status is based on the determination that 
payment of interest or principal is doubtful.
A corporate loan may be classified as non-accrual and still 
be current on principal and interest payments under the 
terms of the loan structure. Citi’s corporate non-accrual 
loans were $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of 
December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 
31, 2022, respectively. 
Consumer non-accrual status is generally based on aging, 
i.e., the borrower has fallen behind on payments.
Consumer mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA)–insured loans, are classified as 
non-accrual within 60 days of notification that the 
borrower has filed for bankruptcy. In addition, home 
equity loans are classified as non-accrual if the related 
residential first mortgage loan is 90 days or more past 
due.
U.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services are not included 
because, under industry standards, credit card loans 
accrue interest until such loans are charged off, which 
typically occurs at 180 days of contractual delinquency.

91

Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans as 
of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current 
on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably 
expects that only a portion of the principal owed will 
ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as 
a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all 
other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally 
recorded as revenue.

(1) Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based on a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest 

payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on 
non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and 
written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such 
loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans. The 
balances above represent non-accrual loans within Corporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(2) Approximately 50%, 50%, 56%, 64% and 44% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal payments at December 31, 2023, 

2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(3) The December 31, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.63% of total corporate loans. 
(4) The increase at December 31, 2023 was primarily related to two commercial real estate loans. 
(5)  Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all periods presented and in Bahrain for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Modified Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial 
Difficulty
On January 1, 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-02, which 
eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for 
TDRs (see Note 1). See Note 15 for information on loan 
modifications during the year ended December 31, 2023.

LIQUIDITY RISK

Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are 
essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise 
from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely 
outside of Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial 
markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, 
changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and other conditions. For additional information, 
see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” above.

Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are 

aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its 
core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, 
structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a 
variety of adverse circumstances, including potential 
Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying 
durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory 
requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to 
resolution planning (see “Resolution Plan” and “Total Loss-
Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” below). Citigroup’s primary 
liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, 
across two major categories:

•

•

Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank 
Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent 
holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary 
intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s 
broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global 
Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and 
Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and 
non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup 
(including Citibanamex).

At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain 
sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer 
assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-
quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of 
stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come 
due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that, 
in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be 
self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in 
conditions established under their designated stress tests.

Citi’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and 

consumer deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including 
Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior 
and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the 
parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These 
sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, 
primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.

Citi’s funding and liquidity framework, working in 
concert with overall asset/liability management, helps ensure 
that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability 
structure (including funding products) of the Company relative 
to the liquidity requirements of Citi’s assets. This reduces the 

risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are 
monetized. The Company holds excess liquidity, primarily in 
the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as presented in 
the table below. 

Citi’s liquidity is managed centrally by Corporate 
Treasury, in conjunction with regional and in-country 
treasurers with oversight provided by Independent Risk 
Management and various Asset & Liability Committees 
(ALCOs) at the individual entity, region, country and business 
levels. Pursuant to this approach, Citi’s HQLA are managed 
with emphasis on asset/liability management and entity-level 
liquidity adequacy throughout Citi.

Citi’s CRO and CFO co-chair Citigroup’s ALCO, which 

includes Citi’s Treasurer and other senior executives. The 
ALCO sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors 
portfolio performance (see “Risk Governance—Board and 
Executive Management Committees” above). Significant 
changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the 
ALCO. Citi also has other ALCOs, which are established at 
various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight 
for individual entities, countries, franchise businesses and 
regions, serving as the primary governance committees for 
managing Citi’s balance sheet and liquidity.

As a supplement to ALCO, Citi’s Funding and Liquidity 
Risk Committee (FLRC) is focused on funding and liquidity 
risk matters. The FLRC reviews and discusses the funding and 
liquidity risk profile of, as well as risk management practices 
for, Citigroup and Citibank and reports its findings and 
recommendations to each relevant ALCO as appropriate.

Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement

Stress Testing 
Liquidity stress testing is performed for each of Citi’s major 
entities, operating subsidiaries and countries. Stress testing 
and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential 
impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and 
liquidity position, in order to have sufficient liquidity on hand 
to manage through such an event. These scenarios include 
assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, 
market triggers (such as credit ratings), potential uses of 
funding and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other 
conditions. These conditions include expected and stressed 
market conditions as well as Company-specific events.

Liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential 
mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety 
of time horizons and over different stressed conditions. To 
monitor the liquidity of an entity, these stress tests and 
potential mismatches are calculated on a daily basis. 

Given the range of potential stresses, Citi maintains 

contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for 
individual entities. These plans specify a wide range of readily 
available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or 
idiosyncratic stresses.

Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, 
therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions 
that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
(1)   Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt 

securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, Mexico, 
India and Hong Kong.

The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at 
Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in 
the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated Liquidity Coverage 
ratio (LCR), pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts 
include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements 
at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these 
minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities 
within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA decreased 
quarter-over-quarter as of the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily 
driven by a reduction in average unsecured debt. 

As of December 31, 2023, Citigroup had approximately 
$965 billion of available liquidity resources to support client 
and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($562 
billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess 
liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other 
entities within Citigroup ($232 billion); and unused borrowing 
capacity from available assets not already accounted for within 
Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank 
discount window ($171 billion).

Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed 
for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, 
Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR.

The LCR is calculated by dividing HQLA by estimated 
net outflows assuming a stressed 30-day period, with the net 
outflows determined by standardized stress outflow and inflow 
rates prescribed in the LCR rule. The outflows are partially 
offset by contractual inflows from assets maturing within 30 
days. Similar to outflows, the inflows are calculated based on 
prescribed factors to various asset categories, such as retail 
loans as well as unsecured and secured wholesale lending. The 
minimum LCR requirement is 100%.

The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR 

calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the 
periods indicated:

Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.

As of December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s average LCR 
decreased from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 
decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in average 
HQLA.

In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity 

resources at quarter end of $965 billion, Citi maintained 
approximately $482 billion of excess liquidity above the 
stressed average net outflow of approximately $483 billion, 
shown in the LCR table above.

95

 
 
 
 
Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding 
Ratio (NSFR) 
As previously disclosed, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a 
rule to assess the availability of a bank’s stable funding against 
a required level. 

In general, a bank’s available stable funding includes 
portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its 
required stable funding will be based on the liquidity 
characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. 
Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the 
various asset and liability classes. The ratio of available stable 
funding to required stable funding is required to be greater 
than 100%. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s 

consolidated NSFR was compliant with the rule. Refer to 
Citi’s U.S. NSFR Disclosure report covering December 31, 
2023 and September 30, 2023 on its website for additional 
information.

End-of-period deposits decreased 4% year-over-year, 

largely due to a reduction in Services reflecting quantitative 
tightening, and a reduction in USPB and Wealth reflecting a 
shift of deposits to higher-yielding products. End-of-period 
deposits increased 3% sequentially. 

On an average basis, deposits declined 3% year-over-year 

and were largely unchanged sequentially. 

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, average deposits for:

•

•

Services decreased 3% year-over-year, while TTS and 
Securities Services decreased 2% and 7%, respectively. 
These declines reflected the impact of quantitative 
tightening that more than offset deposits from new client 
acquisitions and deepening of relationships with existing 
clients. 
USPB decreased 5% year-over-year, driven by the 
transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to 
Wealth. 

• Wealth decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting the 

continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding 
investments on Citi’s platform, partially offset by the 
benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the 
associated deposit balances from USPB.

Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt (generally defined as debt with original 
maturities of one year or more) represents the most significant 
component of Citi’s funding for the Citigroup parent company 
and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source 
of funding for the bank entities. 

Weighted-Average Maturity (WAM) 
The following table presents Citigroup and its affiliates’ 
(including Citibank) WAM of unsecured long-term debt 
issued with a remaining life greater than one year:

Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes 
consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and 
premiums.
(1)  Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent 

holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including 
broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of 
December 31, 2023, non-bank included $92.6 billion of long-term debt 
issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are 
consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging 
activities are also included in this line.

(2)  Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in 
support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured 
financing is also included.

(3)  Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded 

Cards receivables.

Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 6% year-
over-year, largely driven by issuance of customer-related debt 
at the non-bank entities, as well as increased senior benchmark 
debt and FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase was 
partially offset by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the 
non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding 
also increased 4%, largely driven by an increase in customer-
related debt at the non-bank entities and increased FHLB 
borrowings and benchmark senior debt at the bank.

As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, 

and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or 
repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market 
purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and 
repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During 
2023, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of 
approximately $32.0 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.

Resolution Plan
Citigroup is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-
Frank Act) and the rules promulgated by the FDIC and Federal 
Reserve Board (FRB) to periodically submit a plan for Citi’s 
rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in the event of material financial distress or failure. Citigroup 
will alternate between submitting a full resolution plan and a 
targeted resolution plan on a biennial cycle.

Under Citi’s preferred “single point of entry” resolution 

plan strategy, only Citigroup, the parent holding company, 
would enter into bankruptcy, while Citigroup’s material legal 
entities (as defined in the public section of its 2023 resolution 
plan, which can be found on the FRB’s and FDIC’s websites) 
would remain operational outside of any resolution or 
insolvency proceedings. Citigroup’s resolution plan has been 
designed to minimize the risk of systemic impact to the U.S. 
and global financial systems, while maximizing the value of 
the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of Citigroup’s creditors, 
including its unsecured long-term debt holders. 

In addition, in line with the FRB’s total loss-absorbing 
capacity (TLAC) rule, Citigroup’s shareholders and unsecured 
creditors—including its unsecured long-term debt holders—
bear any losses resulting from Citigroup’s bankruptcy. 
Accordingly, any value realized by holders of its unsecured 
long-term debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts 
owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or 
other resolution proceeding of Citigroup.

The FDIC has also indicated that it was developing a 

single point of entry strategy to implement the Orderly 
Liquidation Authority under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which provides the FDIC with the ability to resolve a firm 
when it is determined that bankruptcy would have serious 
adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S.

As previously disclosed, in response to feedback received 
from the FRB and FDIC, Citigroup took the following actions:

(i)  Citicorp LLC (Citicorp), an existing wholly owned 
subsidiary of Citigroup, was established as an 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for certain of 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities;

(ii)  Citigroup executed an inter-affiliate agreement with 

Citicorp, Citigroup’s operating material legal entities and 
certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which Citicorp 
is required to provide liquidity and capital support to 
Citigroup’s operating material legal entities in the event 
that Citigroup were to enter bankruptcy proceedings (Citi 
Support Agreement); 

(iii) pursuant to the Citi Support Agreement:

•

•

•

Citigroup made an initial contribution of assets, 
including certain high-quality liquid assets and inter-
affiliate loans (Contributable Assets), to Citicorp, and 
Citicorp became the business-as-usual funding 
vehicle for Citigroup’s operating material legal 
entities;
Citigroup will be obligated to continue to transfer 
Contributable Assets to Citicorp over time, subject to 
certain amounts retained by Citigroup to, among 
other things, meet Citigroup’s near-term cash needs; 
in the event of a Citigroup bankruptcy, Citigroup will 
be required to contribute most of its remaining assets 
to Citicorp; and

(iv)  the obligations of both Citigroup and Citicorp under the 
Citi Support Agreement, as well as the Contributable 
Assets, are secured pursuant to a security agreement.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
U.S. GSIBs are required to maintain minimum levels of TLAC 
and eligible LTD, each set by reference to the GSIB’s 
consolidated risk-weighted assets (RWA) and total leverage 
exposure. The intended purpose of the requirements is to 
facilitate the orderly resolution of U.S. GSIBs under the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. For 
additional information, including Citi’s TLAC and LTD 
amounts and ratios, see “Capital Resources—Current 
Regulatory Capital Standards” above.

SECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS AND SHORT-
TERM BORROWINGS 
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-
term financings that generally include (i) secured funding 
transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under 
agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, 
short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper and 
borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants. 

Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-
dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through 
Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending 
activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the 
context of market making and customer activities. Secured 
funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by 
government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of 
Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in 
secured lending activity in the matched book (as described 
below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to 
maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market 
conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by 
establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress 
tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, 
collateral type, counterparty and client actions. 

Secured funding of $269 billion as of December 31, 2023 

increased 33% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, largely 
driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-
related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of 
the quarter ended December 31, 2023, on an average basis, 
secured funding was $288 billion. The portion of secured 
funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured 
lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity 
and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such 
as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign 
government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is 
secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of 
which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the 
corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining 
portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory 
held in the context of market making and customer activities.

Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $37 billion as of the fourth 
quarter of 2023 decreased 20% year-over-year, reflecting 
lower commercial paper issuances at the broker-dealer 
subsidiaries, as Citi continues to diversify its funding profile, 
and decreased 1% sequentially, driven by normal business 
activity (see Note 18 for further information on Citigroup’s 
and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings).

CREDIT RATINGS
Citigroup’s funding and liquidity, funding capacity, ability to 
access capital markets and other sources of funds, the cost of 
these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are 
partially dependent on its credit ratings. 

The table below presents the ratings for Citigroup and 
Citibank as of December 31, 2023. While not included in the 
table below, the long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup 
Global Markets Holding Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch 
Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody’s Investors Service and A/A-1 at 
S&P Global Ratings as of December 31, 2023.

Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could 
negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and 
liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative 
triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and 
collateral requirements.

The following information is provided for the purpose of 

analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to 
Citigroup and Citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings 
downgrade across all three major rating agencies. This 
analysis is subject to certain estimates, estimation 
methodologies, judgments and uncertainties. Uncertainties 
include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may 
have with respect to permissible counterparties, as well as 
general subjective counterparty behavior. For example, certain 
corporate customers and markets counterparties could re-
evaluate their business relationships with Citi and limit 
transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with 
Citi. Changes in counterparty behavior could impact Citi’s 
funding and liquidity, as well as the results of operations of 
certain of its businesses. The actual impact to Citigroup or 
Citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the 
potential funding and liquidity impacts described below. For 
additional information on the impact of credit rating changes 
on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risks” above.

Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a hypothetical 
one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating of 
Citigroup Inc. across all three major rating agencies could 
impact Citigroup’s funding and liquidity due to derivative 
triggers by approximately $0.2 billion, compared to $0.3 
billion as of September 30, 2023. Other funding sources, such 
as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a 
hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-
term rating of Citibank across all three major rating agencies 
could impact Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to 
derivative triggers by approximately $0.3 billion, compared to 
$0.4 billion as of September 30, 2023. Other funding sources, 
such as secured financing transactions and other margin 
requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could 
also be adversely affected.

In total, as of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that a 
one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all 
three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate 
cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately 
$0.5 billion, compared to $0.7 billion as of September 30, 
2023 (see also Note 20). As detailed under “High-Quality 
Liquid Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity 
resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as 
a contingency for the potential events described above.
In addition, a broad range of mitigating actions are 
currently included in Citigroup’s and Citibank’s contingency 
funding plans. For Citigroup, these mitigating factors include, 
but are not limited to, accessing surplus funding capacity from 
existing clients, tailoring levels of secured lending and 
adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized 
borrowings at certain Citibank subsidiaries. Mitigating actions 
available to Citibank include, but are not limited to, selling or 
financing highly liquid government securities, tailoring levels 
of secured lending, adjusting the size of select trading assets, 
reducing loan originations and renewals, raising additional 
deposits or borrowing from the FHLB or central banks. Citi 
believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the 
funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above.

 
Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts 
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a 
potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating 
across any of the three major rating agencies could also have 
an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating 
of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to 
consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits, 
primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of 
December 31, 2023, Citibank had liquidity commitments of 
approximately $11.0 billion to consolidated asset-backed 
commercial paper conduits, unchanged from December 31, 
2022 (see Note 23).

In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of 

certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding 
and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades 
described above through mitigating actions, including 
repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial 
paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades 
described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers 
could re-evaluate their deposit relationships with Citibank. 
This re-evaluation could result in clients adjusting their 
discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository 
institution, which could potentially reduce certain deposit 
levels at Citibank. However, Citi could choose to adjust 
pricing, offer alternative deposit products to its existing 
customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers, in 
addition to the mitigating actions referenced above.

MARKET RISK

Overview
Market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in 
the value of Citi’s assets and liabilities resulting from changes 
in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as 
well as their implied volatilities. Market risk arises from both 
Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional 
information on market risk and market risk management at 
Citi, see “Risk Factors” above.

Each business is required to establish, with approval from 
Citi’s market risk management, a market risk limit framework 
for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk 
profiles and is within the parameters of Citi’s overall risk 
appetite. These limits are monitored by the Risk organization, 
including various regional, legal entity and business Risk 
Management committees, Citi’s country and business Asset & 
Liability Committees and the Citigroup Risk Management and 
Asset & Liability Committees. In all cases, the businesses are 
ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for 
remaining within their defined limits.

MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS 
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly 
from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and 
foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on 
Citi’s Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) 
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from 
non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of 
changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in 
foreign currencies. 

Banking Book Interest Rate Risk 
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are 
referred to as the Banking Book. Management of interest rate 
risk in the Banking Book is governed by Citi’s Non-Trading 
Market Risk Policy. Management’s Asset & Liability 
Committee (ALCO) establishes Citi’s risk appetite and related 
limits for interest rate risk in the Banking Book, which are 
subject to approval by Citigroup’s Board of Directors. 
Corporate Treasury is responsible for the day-to-day 
management of Citi’s Banking Book interest rate risk as well 
as periodically reviewing it with the ALCO. Citi’s Banking 
Book interest rate risk management is also subject to 
independent oversight from the second line of defense team 
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer.

Changes in interest rates impact Citi’s net income, AOCI 

and CET1. These changes primarily affect Citi’s Banking 
Book through net interest income, due to a variety of risk 
factors, including:

•

•
•

•

Differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments;
Changes in the level and/or shape of interest rate curves;
Client behavior in response to changes in interest rates 
(e.g., mortgage prepayments, deposit betas); and
Changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from 
changes in the interest rate environment.

103

As part of their ongoing activities, Citi’s businesses generate 
interest rate-sensitive positions from their client-facing 
products, such as loans and deposits. The component of this 
interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via Citi’s 
funds transfer pricing process to Corporate Treasury. 
Corporate Treasury uses various tools to manage the total 
interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite 
and target Citi’s desired risk profile, including its investment 
securities portfolio, company-issued debt and interest rate 
derivatives. 

In addition, Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its 
Banking Book interest rate risk. Interest Rate Exposure (IRE) 
is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios 
on Citi’s Banking Book net interest income and certain other 
interest rate-sensitive income versus a base case. IRE does not 
represent a forecast of Citi’s net interest income.

The scenarios, methodologies and assumptions used in 

this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in 
response to changes in the market environment, changes in 
Citi’s balance sheet composition, enhancements in Citi’s 
modeling and other factors.

Since the third quarter of 2022, Citi has employed 

enhanced IRE methodologies and changes to certain 
assumptions. The changes included, among other things, 
assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions 
to the treatment of certain business contributions (notably 
accrual positions in the Markets businesses). These changes 
resulted in a higher impact to Citi’s net interest income over a 
12-month period.

Under the enhanced methodology, Citi utilizes the most 
recent quarter-end balance sheet, assuming no changes to its 
composition and size over the forecasted horizon (holding the 
balance sheet static). The forecasts incorporate expectations 
and assumptions of deposit pricing, loan spreads and mortgage 
prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in 
each scenario. The base case scenario reflects the market-
implied forward interest rates, and sensitivity scenarios 
assume instantaneous shocks to the base case. The forecasts do 
not assume Citi takes any risk-mitigating actions in response 
to changes in the interest rate environment. Certain interest 
rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate 
scenarios. Deposit pricing sensitivities (i.e., deposit betas) are 
informed by historical and expected behavior. Actual deposit 
pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these 
forecasts.

Citi’s IRE analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the 

following Banking Book assets and liabilities: loans, client 
deposits, Citi’s deposits with other banks, investment 
securities, long-term debt, any related interest rate hedges and 
the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and 
credit portfolio value at risk (VAR). It excludes impacts from 
any positions that are included in total trading and credit 
portfolio VAR.

In addition to IRE, Citi analyzes economic value 
sensitivity (EVS) as a longer-term interest rate risk metric. 
EVS is a net present value (NPV)–based measure of the 
lifetime cash flows of Citi’s Banking Book. It estimates the 
interest rate sensitivity of the Banking Book’s economic value 
from longer-term assets being potentially funded with shorter-
term liabilities, or vice versa. Citi manages EVS within risk 

limits approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors that are 
aligned with Citi’s risk appetite.

Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact 
on AOCI
Citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest 
rates on the value of its AOCI, which can in turn impact Citi’s 
common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact 
Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to 
manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest 
rates, while limiting the potential impact on its AOCI and 
regulatory capital position.

AOCI at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide 
interest rate risk position. AOCI at risk considers potential 
changes in AOCI (and the corresponding impact on the CET1 
Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity.

Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to 

reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated 
changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy 
decisions and changes in economic conditions may be 
reflected in current market-implied forward rates. The 
following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income, AOCI and the CET1 Capital ratio, 
each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps 
increase in interest rates:

The All other currencies of $1,219 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 in the table above includes the impact 
from the following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which 
represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar 
currency impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese 
yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian 
rupee, Singapore dollar, Korean won, Swiss franc and Chinese 
yuan. These impacts per currency are generally in the same 
direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock 
scenario) and not offsetting.

Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster 

than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in 
increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to 
Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock 
scenario as of December 31, 2023 decreased quarter-over-
quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting the net impact 
of lower expected gains due to U.S. dollar interest rate moves 
that have already been realized and changes in Citi’s balance 
sheet. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal 
net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will 
pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher 
betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-
specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may 
drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE.

In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that 

the approximate $0.8 billion initial negative impact to AOCI 
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the 
expected recovery of the impact on AOCI through accretion of 
Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income 
benefit over a period of approximately four months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net 
interest income, AOCI and CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully 
implemented basis) under six different scenarios of changes in 
interest rates for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in 
which Citi has invested capital as of December 31, 2023. The 
100 bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low 
level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption 
that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors 
and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the 
“flooring assumption”). The interest rate scenarios are also 
impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and 
deposit pricing.

Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are 
interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios 
presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-
yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from 
higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1) Scenario 1 includes the impact from the following top six non-U.S. dollar currencies, which represents approximately 50% of the total non-U.S. dollar currency 

impact: approximately $0.2 billion from the Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Korean won, Swiss franc 
and Chinese yuan. These impacts per currency are generally in the same direction (estimated positive impact in the +100 bps shock scenario) and not offsetting.
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on AOCI related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.

(2)

As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to 

Citi’s net interest income is larger under Scenario 2 than 
Scenario 3, as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher 
interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For 
U.S. dollars, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in 
magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the 
lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at 
higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on 
mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. For other 
non-U.S. dollar currencies, exposure to downward rate shocks 
is smaller in magnitude as a result of Citi’s flooring 
assumption, given low rate levels for certain non-U.S. dollar 
currencies.

The magnitude of the impact to AOCI is greater under 

Scenario 2 compared to Scenario 3. This is because the 
combination of changes to Citi’s investment portfolio, 
partially offset by changes related to Citi’s pension liabilities, 
results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at 
shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.

Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on AOCI 
and Capital
As of December 31, 2023, Citi estimates that an unanticipated 
parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar 
against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested 
capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by 
approximately $1.7 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to 
Citi’s CTA in AOCI, net of hedges. This impact would be 
primarily due to changes in the value of the Mexican peso, 
Euro, Singapore dollar and Indian rupee.

This impact is also before any mitigating actions Citi may 

take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency 
translation exposure. Specifically, as currency movements 
change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-
denominated capital, these movements also change the value 
of Citi’s risk-weighted assets denominated in those currencies.

As a percentage of TCE

Estimated impact to CET1 Capital ratio (on a fully implemented basis) 
due to changes in FX translation, net of hedges (bps)

This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, 
such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency 
forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the 
impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital 
ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging 
costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual 
impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital 
compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described 
above.

The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with 

respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates, and the 
quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 
Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 21 for 
additional information on the changes in AOCI.

Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged 
loan programs of $101 million, $165 million and $192 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as Long-term debt and accounted for at fair value, is reported together 
with any changes in fair value as part of Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in Interest expense in the 
table above.

(3)  The average rate on interest income and net interest margin reflects the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustment. See footnote 1 above.
(4)  Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.

Interest income and Net interest income include the taxable equivalent adjustments discussed in the table above.

Citi’s net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 
$13.8 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, 
an increase of $0.6 billion versus the prior year, primarily 
driven by Markets (up approximately $0.4 billion) and non-
Markets (up approximately $0.1 billion). The increase in 
Markets net interest income was primarily driven by Fixed 
Income. The increase in non-Markets primarily reflected 
higher interest rates and growth in U.S. cards interest-earning 
balances, partially offset by a reduction from the exited 
markets and continued wind-downs in All Other—Legacy 
Franchises. Citi’s net interest margin was 2.46% on a taxable 
equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 
three basis points from the prior quarter, largely driven by 
higher deposit costs, partially offset by higher Markets net 
interest margin.

Citi’s net interest income for 2023 increased 13%, or 
approximately $6.2 billion, to $54.9 billion ($55.0 billion on a 
taxable equivalent basis) versus the prior year. The increase 
was primarily due to an increase in non-Markets net interest 
income, largely reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan 
balances in USPB. In 2023, Citi’s net interest margin 
increased to 2.46% on a taxable equivalent basis, compared to 
2.25% in 2022, primarily driven by higher interest rates and a 
mix-shift in balances.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Trading portfolios include positions resulting from market-
making activities, hedges of certain available-for-sale (AFS) 
debt securities, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties 
and all associated hedges, fair value option loans and hedges 
of the loan portfolio within capital markets origination.

The market risk of Citi’s trading portfolios is monitored 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures, 
including, but not limited to, factor sensitivities, value at risk 
(VAR) and stress testing. Each trading portfolio across Citi’s 
businesses has its own market risk limit framework 
encompassing these measures and other controls, including 
trading mandates, new product approval, permitted product 
lists and pre-trade approval for larger, more complex and less 
liquid transactions. These controls enable the monitoring and 
management of Citi’s top market risks.

The following chart of total daily trading-related revenue 
(loss) captures trading volatility and shows the number of days 
in which revenues for Citi’s trading businesses fell within 
particular ranges. Trading-related revenue includes trading, net 
interest and other revenue associated with Citi’s trading 
businesses. It excludes DVA, FVA and CVA adjustments 
incurred due to changes in the credit quality of counterparties, 
as well as any associated hedges of that CVA. In addition, it 
excludes fees and other revenue associated with capital 
markets origination activities. Trading-related revenues are 
driven by both customer flows and the changes in valuation of 
the trading inventory. As presented in the chart below, positive 
trading-related revenue was achieved for 94.6% of the trading 
days in 2023.

In millions of dollars

(1)   Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic hedges of certain AFS debt securities. Specifically, the change in the fair value of hedging 

derivatives is included in trading-related revenue, while the offsetting change in the fair value of hedged AFS debt securities is included in AOCI and not reflected 
above.

114

     
Factor Sensitivities
Factor sensitivities are expressed as the change in the value of 
a position for a defined change in a market risk factor, such as 
a change in the value of a U.S. Treasury Bond for a one-basis-
point change in interest rates. Citi’s Global Market Risk 
function, within the Independent Risk Management 
organization, works to ensure that factor sensitivities are 
calculated, monitored and limited for all material risks taken in 
the trading portfolios.

Value at Risk (VAR)
VAR estimates, at a 99% confidence level, the potential 
decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal 
market conditions assuming a one-day holding period. VAR 
statistics, which are based on historical data, can be materially 
different across firms due to differences in portfolio 
composition, VAR methodologies and model parameters. As a 
result, Citi believes VAR statistics can be used more 
effectively as indicators of trends in risk-taking within a firm, 
rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk-taking 
across firms.

Citi uses a single, independently approved Monte Carlo 

simulation VAR model (see “VAR Model Review and 
Validation” below), which has been designed to capture 

material risk sensitivities (such as first- and second-order 
sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices) of 
various asset classes/risk types (such as interest rate, credit 
spread, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks). Citi’s 
VAR includes positions that are measured at fair value; it does 
not include investment securities classified as AFS or HTM. 
See Note 14 for information on these securities.

Citi believes its VAR model is conservatively calibrated 

to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term 
(approximately the most recent month) and long-term (18 
months for commodities and three years for others) market 
volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation involves approximately 
550,000 market factors, making use of approximately 480,000 
time series, with sensitivities updated daily, volatility 
parameters updated intra-monthly and correlation parameters 
updated monthly. The conservative features of the VAR 
calibration contribute an approximate 30% add-on to what 
would be a VAR estimated under the assumption of stable and 
perfectly, normally distributed markets. 

As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading 
VAR increased $12 million from 2022 to 2023, mainly due to 
increased market volatility. Citi’s average trading and credit 
portfolio VAR decreased $6 million from 2022 to 2023.

(1) Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VAR and the sum of the VARs tied to each risk type. The 
benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a given day will be 
lower than the sum of the VARs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an 
examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.

(2)  The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions with the exception of hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option 

loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.

(3)   The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR. 
(4)   The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, all 

associated CVA hedges and market sensitivity FVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges of the loan portfolio, fair 
value option loans and hedges of the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination.

VAR Model Review and Validation
Generally, Citi’s VAR review and model validation process 
entails reviewing the model framework, major assumptions 
and implementation of the mathematical algorithm. In 
addition, product-specific back-testing on portfolios is 
periodically completed as part of the ongoing model 
performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi’s U.S. 
banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-
testing (as described below) is performed against buy-and-
hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-
portfolios across the organization (trading desk level and total 
Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S. banking 
regulators.

Material VAR model and assumption changes must be 

independently validated within Citi’s Independent Risk 
Management organization. All model changes, including those 
for the VAR model, are validated by the model validation 
group within Citi’s Model Risk Management. In the event of 
significant model changes, parallel model runs are undertaken 
prior to implementation. In addition, significant model and 
assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and 
approval by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

Citi uses the same independently validated VAR model 
for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR (i.e., 
total trading and total trading and credit portfolios VARs) and, 
as such, the model review and validation process for both 
purposes is as described above.

Regulatory VAR, which is calculated in accordance with 

Basel III, differs from Risk Management VAR because certain 
positions included in Risk Management VAR are not eligible 

116

for market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The 
composition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under 
“Value at Risk” above. The applicability of the VAR model 
for positions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S. 
regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved 
by Citi’s U.S. banking regulators.

In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR includes 
all trading book-covered positions and all foreign exchange 
and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III, Regulatory 
VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability 
to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non-
trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically 
excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR excludes 
CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi’s own fair 
value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from 
Regulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as 
computed under the Advanced Approaches for determining 
risk-weighted assets.

Regulatory VAR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-
testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR 
model. Regulatory VAR back-testing is the process in which 
the daily one-day VAR, at a 99% confidence interval, is 
compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit 
and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of 
the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit 
and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss 
attributable to price movements in covered positions from the 
close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and 
loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and 
commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in 
reserves.

Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two 

to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses 
exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the conservative 
calibration of Citi’s VAR model (as a result of taking the 
greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling 
of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under 
normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable 
market conditions could increase the number of back-testing 
exceptions.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following graph presents the daily buy-and-hold 

profit and loss associated with Citi’s covered positions 
compared to Citi’s one-day Regulatory VAR during 2023. 
During 2023, three back-testing exceptions were observed at 
the Citigroup level.

The difference between the 47.7% of days with buy-and-
hold gains for Regulatory VAR back-testing and the 94.6% of 
days with trading, net interest and other revenue associated 
with Citi’s trading businesses, presented in the histogram of 
daily trading-related revenue below, reflects, among other 
things, that a significant portion of Citi’s trading-related 
revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these 
positions and exposures, as well as differences in the portfolio 
composition of Regulatory VAR and Risk Management VAR.

Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit and Loss(1)(2)—12 Months Ended December 31, 2023
In millions of dollars

(1)   Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking regulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market revenue movement attributable to the 
trading position from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day trading 
profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as changes in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the trading-related revenue presented in the chart of 
daily trading-related revenue above.

(2)  The loss values for mid-August and mid-December 2023 were driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso.

117

Stress Testing
Citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to 
estimate the impact of extreme market movements. It is 
performed on individual positions and trading portfolios, as 
well as in aggregate, inclusive of multiple trading portfolios. 
Citi’s market risk management, after consultations with the 
businesses, develops both systemic and specific stress 
scenarios, reviews the output of periodic stress testing 
exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing 
appropriateness of exposure levels and limits. Citi uses two 
complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across 
all major risk factors (i.e., equity, foreign exchange, 
commodity, interest rate and credit spreads): top-down 
systemic stresses and bottom-up business-specific stresses. 
Systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact 
of extreme market movements on an institution-wide basis, 
and are constructed using both historical periods of market 
stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios. 
Business-specific stresses are designed to probe the risks of 
particular portfolios and market segments, especially those 
risks that are not fully captured in VAR and systemic stresses.
The systemic stress scenarios and business-specific stress 
scenarios at Citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior 
management and also to calculate internal risk capital for 
trading market risk, as well as enable the monitoring and 
managing of Citi’s top market risks.

In general, changes in market values are defined over a 
one-year horizon. For the most liquid positions and market 
factors, changes in market values are defined over a shorter 
two-month horizon. The limited set of positions and market 
factors whose market value changes are defined over a two-
month horizon are those that in management’s judgment have 
historically remained very liquid during financial crises, even 
as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market 
factors materially declined.

OPERATIONAL RISK 

Overview
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal processes or systems, including human error or 
misjudgment, or from external events. This includes legal risk, 
which is the risk of loss (including litigation costs, settlements 
and regulatory fines) resulting from the failure of Citi to 
comply with laws, regulations, prudent ethical standards and 
contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses, but 
excludes strategic and reputation risks. Citi also recognizes the 
impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated 
with Citi’s business activities. 

Operational risk is inherent in Citi’s global business 
activities, as well as related support functions, and can result 
in losses. Citi maintains a comprehensive Company-wide risk 
taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using 
standardized definitions across Citi’s Operational Risk 
Management Framework (see discussion below). This 
taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and 
expectations inclusive of those related to U.S. Basel III, 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), 
Heightened Standards for Large Financial Institutions and 
Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST). 

118

Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall 
framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” 
above. Citi’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate 
levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses, the 
markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the 
competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This 
includes effectively managing operational risk and 
maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within 
Citi’s operational risk appetite.

Citi’s Independent Operational Risk Management group 

has established a global Operational Risk Management 
Framework with policies and practices for identification, 
measurement, monitoring, managing and reporting operational 
risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal 
control environment. As part of this framework, Citi has 
defined its operational risk appetite and established a 
manager’s control assessment (MCA) process for self-
identification of significant operational risks, assessment of 
the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk 
above acceptable levels. 

Each Citi operating segment must implement operational 

risk processes consistent with the requirements of this 
framework. This includes:

understanding the operational risks they are exposed to;
designing controls to mitigate identified risks;
establishing key indicators;

•
•
•
• monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk 

•

•

•

exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite;
having processes in place to bring operational risk 
exposures within acceptable levels; 
periodically estimating and aggregating the operational 
risks they are exposed to; and
ensuring that sufficient resources are available to 
actively improve the operational risk environment and 
mitigate emerging risks.

Citi considers operational risks that result from the 
introduction of new or changes to existing products, or result 
from significant changes in its organizational structures, 
systems, processes and personnel. 

Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of 

operational risk exposures through Business Risk and Controls 
Committees (BRCCs), which are focused at the group, 
business or function, or geography level. BRCCs provide 
channels to inform senior management about operational risk 
exposures, control issues and operational risk events, and 
allow them to take and document decisions around the 
mitigation, remediation or acceptance of operational risk 
exposures.

In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the 
Operational Risk Management group, works proactively with 
Citi’s businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded 
operational risk management culture and framework across 
Citi. The Operational Risk Management group actively 
challenges business and functions implementation of the 
Operational Risk Management Framework requirements and 
the quality of operational risk management practices and 
outcomes.

Information about businesses’ key operational risks, 
historical operational risk losses and the control environment 
is reported by each major business segment and functional 
area. Citi’s operational risk profile and related information is 
summarized and reported to senior management, as well as to 
the Audit and Risk Committees of Citi’s Board of Directors by 
the Head of Operational Risk Management.

Operational risk is measured through Operational Risk 

Capital and Operational Risk Regulatory Capital for the 
Advanced Approaches under Basel III. Projected operational 
risk losses under stress scenarios are estimated as a required 
part of the FRB’s CCAR process. 

For additional information on Citi’s operational risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above.

Cybersecurity Risk 

Overview
Cybersecurity risk is the business risk associated with the 
threat posed by a cyberattack, cyber breach or the failure to 
protect Citi’s most vital business information assets or 
operations, resulting in a financial or reputational loss (see the 
operational processes and systems and cybersecurity risk 
factors in “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above). With an 
evolving threat landscape, ever-increasing sophistication of 
threat actor tactics, techniques and procedures, ongoing and 
emerging geopolitical conflicts, and the use of new 
technologies, including those enabled by artificial intelligence 
and machine learning capabilities, to conduct financial 
transactions, Citi and its clients, customers and third parties 
(and fourth parties, etc.) continue to be at risk from 
cyberattacks and information security incidents. Citi leverages 
a threat-focused, defense-in-depth strategy that ensures that 
multiple controls work in tandem against various threats to 
increase the likelihood that malicious activity will be 
prevented, detected and mitigated.

annually by Citi’s Risk Committee, chaired by Citi’s Chief 
Risk Officer. Citi’s Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement 
leverages key risk indicators to establish enterprise risk 
tolerance and define risk management strategy with respect to 
cyber and information security. Further, Citi actively 
participates in financial industry, government and cross-sector 
knowledge-sharing groups to enhance individual and 
collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Governance
Citi’s technology and cybersecurity risk management program 
is built on Citi’s three lines of defense, each of which is 
integrated into Citi’s overall risk management systems and 
processes. 

Citi’s Chief Information Security Office, which is led by 

Citi’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), serves as the 
first line of defense. This office provides frontline business, 
operational and technical controls and capabilities to (1) 
protect against cybersecurity risks, and (2) respond to cyber 
incidents and data breaches. Citi manages cybersecurity 
threats through its state-of-the-art fusion centers, which serve 
as central commands for monitoring and coordinating 
responses to cyber threats. 

Citi’s Chief Information Security Office is responsible for 

application and infrastructure defense and security controls, 
performing vulnerability assessments and third-party 
information security assessments (including cybersecurity risk 
assessments associated with Citi’s use of products and services 
from vendors and other third-party providers), employee 
awareness and training programs and security incident 
management. In each case, the enterprise information security 
team works in coordination with a network of information 
security officers who are embedded within Citi’s global 
businesses and functions, consistent with Citi’s philosophy 
that all Citi stakeholders have a responsibility in managing 
cyber and information security risks. 

Citi has a mature cybersecurity threat identification and 

Citi’s Technology and Cyber Compliance and Operational 

management program that relies on an industry-aligned 
defense-in-depth approach, including an internal cybersecurity 
intelligence center, participation in industry and government 
information-sharing programs, vulnerability assessment and 
scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, 
security incident and event management systems, firewalls, 
penetration testing, adversary emulation exercises, data 
management (including classification, encryption at rest and in 
transit, and access management), multi-factor authentication 
requirements and other logical, physical and technical controls 
designed to prevent, deter, mitigate and respond to 
cybersecurity threats. 

Citi’s cyber and information security program is 

supported by comprehensive governance, including policies, 
standards and procedures that dictate requirements and best 
practices around various topics, including, but not limited to, 
third-party risk management, data management, asset 
management, information security practices, security incident 
management, and regulatory and disclosure compliance. Citi’s 
Chief Information Security Office’s risks and controls are 
measured against its Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement, 
which was initially approved by the Risk Management 
Committee of the Board of Directors and is reapproved 

Risk Office (TCCORO) serves as the second line of defense. 
This office independently evaluates and challenges Citi’s risk 
mitigation practices and capabilities, from a fused operational 
risk and compliance lens. It functions as a joint second line of 
defense and in accordance with Citi’s Cybersecurity Risk 
Appetite Statement. TCCORO also advises first line partners 
in CISO, supporting enterprise-wide efforts to proactively 
identify and remediate cybersecurity risks before they 
materialize as incidents that negatively affect business 
operations.

To address evolving cybersecurity risks and 

corresponding regulations, TCCORO monitors cybersecurity 
legal and regulatory requirements, identifies and defines 
emerging risks, executes strategic cybersecurity threat 
assessments, performs new product and initiative reviews, 
performs data management risk oversight and conducts 
cybersecurity risk assurance reviews (inclusive of third-party 
assessments). In addition, this office oversees and challenges 
metrics related to cybersecurity and technology and ensures 
they remain aligned with Citi’s overall operational risk 
management framework to effectively track, identify and 
manage risk. TCCORO presents an independent viewpoint on 
enterprise cybersecurity risk posture, and oversees CISO’s 

119

cybersecurity risk identification, measurement and enterprise-
wide governance of cybersecurity risk.

Internal Audit serves as Citi’s third line of defense and 
provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee of the 
Board on the effectiveness of controls operated by the first and 
second lines of defense to manage cybersecurity risk. 

Citi recognizes the risks associated with outsourcing 

services to, sharing data with, and/or technologically 
interacting with third parties. Citi has built a robust third-party 
information security risk management program that governs 
third-party engagements from selection, to the establishment 
of legal agreements that govern the relationship, to ongoing 
monitoring through the duration of the relationship. Third-
party risk management includes contractual requirements 
around data and cybersecurity, vulnerability assessments, 
third-party information security assessments performed at 
intervals determined by risk, governance to manage end-of-life 
and end-of-vendor-support risks, and third-party incident 
response protocols. 

Management Governance
Citi’s Head of Operations and Technology (O&T), who 
reports directly to Citi’s CEO, has overall responsibility for 
Citi’s first line of defense cyber and information security and 
technology programs. Citi’s Head of O&T has over 40 years 
of experience in financial services and technology focused 
roles, including prior positions at Citi as a regional Chief 
Information Officer, Head of Technology for Citi’s former 
Institutional Clients Group and Head of Securities and 
Banking Operations and Technology. For additional 
information, see “Corporate Information—Executive Officers” 
below.

Citi’s CISO, who reports directly to Citi’s Head of O&T, 

has primary responsibility to assess and manage Citi’s material 
risks from cybersecurity threats. Citi’s CISO has decades of 
experience in managing cybersecurity risks from prior roles as 
Deutsche Bank’s Chief Security Officer, the Chief Information 
Officer for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Chief 
Information Officer for the U.S. Intelligence Community. The 
CISO is supported by a team of subject matter experts in 
security operations, network architecture, cyber and 
information security governance and cybersecurity operations. 
Citi’s Chief Information Security Office employs 
approximately 3,400 individuals to manage its operations. 

Citi’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), who also reports 
directly to Citi’s Head of O&T, has primary responsibility for 
technology policy, innovation enablement and strategy. Citi’s 
CTO has decades of subject matter experience in financial 
services and technology from previously leading the 
Engineering and Architecture Services group at J.P. Morgan 
Chase, and serving as the Chief Technology Officer at 
Deutsche Bank and the Chief Information Officer for Sales, 
Research and Securities Data Services at Goldman Sachs. 
Multiple management committees and functions also 

support Citi’s cyber and information security management. 
Citi’s Information Security Risk Committee (ISRC) 
governs enterprise-level risk tolerance, including cybersecurity 
risk. This committee serves as the most senior cyber and 
information security forum within Citi and is supported by 
other committees/forums described below. The committee is 

120

co-chaired by Citi’s Chief Risk Officer and Head of O&T and 
meets at least quarterly. In addition, the committee oversees 
risk tolerance determinations, reviews emerging threats and 
their business impacts, commits to appropriate resource levels 
and investments and supports the continual improvement of 
the cyber and information security management programs 
across all of Citi’s businesses and geographies. 

The Chief Information Officer Committee (CIOC), which 

consists of, among others, the Head of O&T, Citi’s Co-Chief 
Information Officers (who report to the Head of O&T), the 
CISO, and the Head of TCCORO (who reports both to Citi’s 
Head of Operational Risk within the Risk Organization and its 
Head of Global Functions Compliance within the Global Legal 
and Compliance Organization), serves as an escalation forum 
for items requiring the attention of technology senior 
management, including approval of policies, and reports items 
requiring further escalation to the Technology Committee of 
the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 

The Information Security Risk Operating Committee 

(ISROC) is chaired by the CISO and comprises senior 
members of the Chief Information Security Office and 
representatives from partner organizations. This committee 
sets the direction and prioritization for the implementation of 
the cyber and information security program across Citi. The 
committee reports and escalates to the CIOC, including for 
intermediary review and approval of policies escalated from 
the Information Technology Policy Council (see below). Any 
actions constituting risk exceptions are escalated to the ISRC.
The Security Architecture Council, which reports to the 

ISROC, is an oversight and decision-making body focused on 
ensuring that the target level of security architectural maturity 
is attained. This council is co-chaired by two representatives 
from the security architecture and cybersecurity services 
organizations. 

Citi’s Information Technology Policy Council provides a 
centralized review to oversee consistency in the formation of 
information technology policies and standards. This counsel 
maintains oversight of policy document requirements to 
ensure that information technology policy documents meet 
Citi’s objectives as established internally and are in line with 
laws and regulations as identified and communicated by 
ICRM. 

In addition, Citi regularly engages third parties globally to 

assess, audit and/or exercise Citi’s cyber and information 
security program, which is ISO-27001 certified. ISO-27001 is 
an international standard for information security management 
systems. Citi is regulated by bodies across the globe that also 
regularly examine and audit Citi’s cyber and information 
security program against local laws, regulations and industry 
best practices. 

Board Governance 
Citi’s Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight 
of senior management’s efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk 
and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Citi’s Board includes 
members with cybersecurity expertise and experience.

Citi’s full Board is briefed annually on cybersecurity risks 

and receives updates as needed on Citi’s cyber and 
information security program, including changes to the threat 
landscape and a roadmap for progress around addressing 

related risks. Additionally, Citi’s Board participates in 
cybersecurity exercises to improve preparedness to address 
cybersecurity incidents.

The Board’s Technology Committee receives quarterly 

updates from the Chief Information Security Office on the 
cybersecurity threat landscape, regulatory landscape, posture, 
and strategy and engages in discussions throughout the year 
with senior management and subject matter experts on the 
effectiveness of Citi’s overall cybersecurity program. 

The Board’s Risk Management Committee (RMC) 
approved a standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement 
against which Citi’s performance is measured quarterly. In 
addition, the RMC oversees Citi’s risk profile, which includes 
cybersecurity risk, and monitors whether Citi is operating 
within its cybersecurity risk appetite under its mandate to 
review key operational risks, including steps taken by 
management to control such risks.

In the event of a potentially material cybersecurity 
incident impacting Citi, the Board would be made aware of 
such incident via lines of communication that run from the 
Chief Information Security Office to senior management and 
also to the Board. This contemporaneous reporting on 
significant cyber events includes information and discussion 
around incident response, legal obligations (including 
disclosure), and outreach and notification to regulators and 
customers when needed. 

For additional information on the Board’s oversight of 
cybersecurity risk management, see Citi’s upcoming 2024 
Annual Meeting Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC in 
March 2024. 

COMPLIANCE RISK
Compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial 
condition and resilience arising from violations of laws, rules 
or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed 
practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. 
Compliance risk exposes Citi to fines, civil money penalties, 
payment of damages and the voiding of contracts. Compliance 
risk can result in diminished reputation, harm to Citi’s 
customers, limited business opportunities and lessened 
expansion potential. It encompasses the risk of noncompliance 
with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical 
standards and some contractual obligations. It could also 
include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all 
aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.

Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong 

ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and 
regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and 
execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) 
Framework (as set forth in the CRM Policy) that is designed to 
manage compliance risk effectively across Citi, with a view to 
fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management 
culture across the lines of defense taking into account Citi’s 
risk governance framework and regulatory requirements. 

Independent Compliance Risk Management’s (ICRM) 

primary objectives are to:

•

Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control 
throughout Citi;

• Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Framework that 
facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, national 
or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal 
policies, standards and procedures and relevant standards 
of conduct;
Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, 
functions and geographies, supported by globally 
consistent systems and compliance risk management 
processes; and
Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting 
capabilities.

•

•

Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its 

responsibilities through the CRM Framework, which is 
composed of the following integrated key activities, to 
holistically manage compliance risk:

• Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and 
regulations by identifying and analyzing changes, 
assessing the impact, and implementing appropriate 
policies, processes and controls;
Developing and providing compliance training to ensure 
colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws, 
rules and regulations;

•

• Monitoring the Compliance Risk Appetite, which is 

•

•

articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements 
describing Citi’s appetite for certain types of risk and 
quantitative measures to monitor the Company’s 
compliance risk exposure;
Executing Compliance Risk Assessments, the results of 
which inform Compliance Risk Monitoring and testing of 
compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance 
with laws, rules, regulations and internal policies; and
Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive 
accountability, including measurement and reporting of 
compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in 
support of the CRM Policy and Compliance Risk 
Appetite.

To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi 
has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and 
centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable 
more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance 
risk management. 

Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to 
identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with 
its businesses and functions. ICRM is responsible for 
oversight of Citi’s CRM Policy, while all businesses and 
global control functions are responsible for managing their 
compliance risks and operating within the Compliance Risk 
Appetite. 

As discussed above, Citi is working to address the FRB 

and OCC consent orders, which include improvements to 
Citi’s CRM Framework and its enterprise-wide application 
(see “Citi’s Consent Order Compliance” above).

121

REPUTATION RISK 
Citi’s reputation is a vital asset in building trust, and Citi is 
diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its key 
stakeholders. To support this, Citi has developed a reputation 
risk framework. Under this framework, Citigroup and 
Citibank, N.A. have implemented a risk appetite statement and 
related key indicators to monitor corporate activities and 
operations relative to Citi’s risk appetite. The framework also 
requires that business segments escalate potential material 
reputation risks that require review or mitigation through the 
applicable business Management Forum or Group Reputation 
Risk Committee. 

The Group Reputation Risk Committee and Management 

Forums, which are composed of Citi’s senior executives, 
govern the process by which material reputation risks are 
identified, measured, monitored, controlled, escalated and 
reported. The Group Reputation Risk Committee and 
Management Forums determine the appropriate actions to be 
taken in line with risk appetite and regulatory expectations, 
while promoting a culture of risk awareness and high 
standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the 
Company, consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value 
Proposition. The Group Reputation Risk Committee may 
escalate reputation risks to the Nomination, Governance and 
Public Affairs Committee or other appropriate committee of 
the Citigroup Board of Directors. 

Every Citi employee is responsible for safeguarding Citi’s 

reputation, guided by Citi’s Code of Conduct. Colleagues are 
expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in 
decisions and actions. They are also expected to promptly 
escalate all issues that present material reputation risk in line 
with policy.

STRATEGIC RISK
As discussed above, strategic risk is the risk of a sustained 
impact (not episodic impact) to Citi’s core strategic objectives 
as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings, market 
capitalization or capital, arising from external factors affecting 
the Company’s operating environment, as well as the risks 
associated with defining and executing the strategy, which are 
identified, measured and managed as part of the Strategic Risk 
Framework at the Enterprise Level. 

In this context, external factors affecting Citi’s operating 

environment are the economic conditions, geopolitical/
political landscape, industry/competitive landscape, customer/
client behavior, regulatory/legislative environment and trends 
related to investors/shareholders. Material strategic risks that 
Citi is monitoring include the impacts of an extended period of 
high inflation and interest rates, as well as macroeconomic 
uncertainties driven by low global growth and geopolitical 
issues including the Middle East conflict, the Russia–Ukraine 
war and U.S.–China tensions. Heightened regulatory 
requirements, specifically with regard to capital as well as 
climate-related transition risk, remain in focus. In addition to 
external factors affecting Citi’s operating environment, Citi 
also monitors risks related to the execution of its strategy, with 
heightened focus on delivering the transformation of its risk 
and control environment pursuant to the FRB and OCC 
consent orders.

122

Citi’s Executive Management Team is responsible for the 
development and execution of Citi’s strategy. This strategy is 
translated into forward-looking plans (collectively Citi’s 
Strategic Plan) that are then cascaded across the organization. 
Citi’s Strategic Plan is presented to the Board on an annual 
basis, and is aligned with risk appetite thresholds and includes 
a risk assessment as required by internal frameworks. It is also 
aligned with limit requirements for capital allocation. 
Governance and oversight of strategic risk is facilitated by 
internal committees on a group-wide basis.

Citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately 
considered and addressed across its various risk management 
activities, and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of 
Citi’s risk appetite. Citi conducts a top-down, bottom-up risk 
identification process to identify risks, including strategic 
risks. Business segments undertake a quarterly risk 
identification process to systematically identify and document 
all material risks faced by Citi. Independent Risk Management 
oversees the risk identification process through regular 
reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of top 
risks. In addition, Citi performs a quarterly Risk Assessment 
of the Plan (RAOP) and continuously monitors risks 
associated with its execution of strategy. Independent Risk 
Management also manages strategic risk by monitoring risk 
appetite thresholds in conjunction with its Global Strategic 
Risk Committee, which is part of the governance structure that 
Citi has in place to manage its strategic risks.

For additional information on Citi’s strategic risks, see 

“Risk Factors—Strategic Risks” above.

Climate Risk
Climate change presents immediate and long-term risks to Citi 
and its clients and customers, with the risks expected to 
increase over time. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss 
arising from climate change and comprises both physical risk 
and transition risk. 

Climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver 

of other categories of risk, such as credit risk from obligors 
exposed to high climate risk, strategic risks if Citi fails to 
consider transition risk in client selection, reputational risk 
from increased stakeholder concerns about financing or failing 
to finance high-carbon industries and operational risk from 
physical risks to Citi’s facilities. Citi’s focus on climate risk 
continues to advance, driven by materiality of strategic, 
reputation and financial risk considerations. Citi continues to 
make progress toward embedding these considerations into its 
overarching risk management approach. For additional 
information on climate risk, see “Risk Factors—Strategic 
Risks” above.

Citi continues to develop globally consistent principles 
and approaches for managing climate risk across the Company 
through the implementation of its Climate Risk Management 
Framework (Climate RMF). The Climate RMF provides 
information on the governance, roles and responsibilities, and 
principles to support the identification, measurement, 
monitoring, controlling and reporting of climate risks. 
Through this implementation, climate risk is being embedded 
into relevant policies and processes over time. 

Citi continues to enhance its methodologies for 
quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual 
credit profiles of its clients across various sectors. Citi has 
developed and embedded sector-specific climate risk 
assessments in its credit underwriting process for certain 
sectors that Citi has identified as higher climate risk. Such 
climate risk assessments are designed to incorporate publicly 
available client disclosures and data from third-party providers 
and facilitate conversations with clients on their most material 
climate risks and management plans for adaptation and 
mitigation. This helps Citi better understand its clients’ 
businesses and climate-related risks and support their financial 
needs. Citi’s Net Zero plan implementation is leading to the 
further integration of climate risk discussions into client 
engagement and client selection.

Citi also reviews factors related to climate risk under its 
Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, 
which includes a focus on climate risk related to financed 
projects and clients in certain sectors. Considering the credit 
risk of stranded assets, as well as the reputational risks, Citi’s 
ESRM Policy describes sector approaches to certain high-
carbon sectors, including thermal coal mining and power. 
Furthermore, Citi continues to participate in financial 
industry initiatives and develop and pilot methodologies and 
approaches for measuring and assessing the potential financial 
risks of climate change, including scenario analysis. Citi also 
continues to monitor regulatory developments on climate risk 
and sustainable finance and actively engage with regulators on 
these topics.

For additional information about sustainability and other 

ESG matters at Citi, see “Climate Change and Net Zero” 
above.

OTHER RISKS

LIBOR Transition Risk 
As previously disclosed, the USD LIBOR bank panel ended 
on June 30, 2023. The overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR 
settings have permanently ceased, and the Financial Conduct 
Authority is requiring ICE Benchmark Administration to 
continue publishing one-, three- and six-month USD LIBOR 
settings using a synthetic methodology, which is based on the 
relevant CME Term SOFR Reference Rate plus the respective 
ISDA fixed spread adjustment. These synthetic settings are 
expected to cease on September 30, 2024. As previously 
disclosed, as of June 30, 2023, Citi transitioned nearly all of its 
USD LIBOR-referencing contracts to SOFR plus a credit 
spread adjustment. There remain a de minimis number of 
unremediated USD LIBOR-referencing contracts that are 
temporarily utilizing synthetic LIBOR, and Citi is continuing 
to focus on remediating these remaining contracts. 

123

Country Risk

Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023. 
(Including the U.S., Citi’s top 25 exposures by country would 
represent approximately 99% of Citi’s exposure to all 
countries as of December 31, 2023.) 

For purposes of the table, loan amounts are reflected in 
the country where the loan is booked, which is generally based 
on the domicile of the borrower. For example, a loan to a 
Chinese subsidiary of a Switzerland-based corporation will 
generally be categorized as a loan in China. In addition, Citi 
has developed regional booking centers in certain countries, 
most significantly in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, 

in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers. As 
an example, with respect to the U.K., only 39% of corporate 
loans presented in the table below are to U.K. domiciled 
entities (42% for unfunded commitments), with the balance of 
the loans predominately to European domiciled counterparties. 
Approximately 90% of the total U.K. funded loans and 88% of 
the total U.K. unfunded commitments were investment grade 
as of December 31, 2023. 

Trading account assets and investment securities are 
generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of 
the security of the underlying reference entity. For additional 
information on the assets included in the table, see the 
footnotes to the table below.

Russia

Overview
In Russia, Citi’s remaining operations are conducted through 
Services, Markets, Banking and All Other—Legacy 
Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, 
related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to 
mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.

As part of previously disclosed plans, Citi ended nearly 
all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia, 
with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its 
remaining legal and regulatory obligations. In addition, Citi 
significantly reduced its All Other—Legacy Franchises 
consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia 
Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry 
into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank. 

Citi has ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in 
Russia. Citi will continue to manage its existing legal and 
regulatory commitments and obligations, as well as support its 
employees, during this period. For additional information on 
Citi’s wind-down of its Russia operations, see “Citi’s Wind-
Down of Its Russia Operations” below.

For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its 
Russia exposures, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risks,”

(1) 
(2)  Reverse repurchase agreements are gross of collateral and are included in net MTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of collateral for Russia-

related reverse repurchase agreements was removed in the second quarter of 2022. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, 
the enforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in 
Ukraine.

(3)  Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies. 
(4)  Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia and foreign financial institutions.
(5)  Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as custodian for investor clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the Deposit 

Insurance Agency (DIA). Citi is unable to remit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. In accordance with a Central Bank 
of Russia regulatory requirement, all balances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred to the DIA in the second quarter of 2023.

(6)  The majority of AO Citibank’s third-party exposures was funded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and 

personal banking clients.

(7)  Citigroup’s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in 

AO Citibank and would be recognized in Citigroup’s earnings only upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank. Citi has separately 
described these risks in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.

125

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi’s Russia-related 
exposures increased by $0.7 billion, as presented in the table 
above. The increase in exposure was driven by a $0.4 billion 
appreciation of the ruble against the U.S. dollar (USD) as well 
as dividend inflows during the quarter, received from Russian 
corporations on behalf of Citi’s clients. The dividend inflows 
were partially offset by deposit outflows and tax payments to 
local authorities. Approximately 71% of Citi’s remaining 
exposures in Russia are corporate dividends that Citi cannot 
remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian 
government, of which $3.9 billion is held with the Deposit 
Insurance Agency as of December 31, 2023. 

Citi’s net investment in Russia was approximately $0.2 
billion as of December 31, 2023 (down from $1.0 billion as of 
September 30, 2023). The decline was due to a reserve build 
related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures 
in Russia driven by safety and soundness considerations under 
U.S. banking law (see “Significant Accounting Policies and 
Significant Estimates” below).

Citi hedges its ruble/USD spot FX exposure in AOCI 
through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-
market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in AOCI. 
When the ruble depreciates against the USD, the USD 
equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank 
also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in 
value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going 
forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-
denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a 
change in the fair value of derivative positions used to 
economically hedge the exposures. 

Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi’s Businesses
Services, Markets, Banking, USPB and All Other results have 
been impacted by various macroeconomic factors and 
volatilities, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its 
direct and indirect impact on the European and global 
economies. For a broader discussion of these factors and 
volatilities on Citi’s businesses, see “Executive Summary” and 
each business’s results of operations above. 

As of December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s ACL included a 

$0.1 billion remaining credit reserve for Citi’s direct Russian 
counterparties (unchanged from September 30, 2023). This 
balance does not include the additional reserves to transfer risk 
for exposures in Russia.

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations 
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its 
Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking 
businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In 
connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred 
approximately $63 million to-date in charges, largely from 
restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related 
charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $58 
million in estimated charges (approximately $2 million in 
Services, Markets and Banking and $56 million in All Other, 
excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). This estimate 
was revised down during the fourth quarter of 2023 from $85 
million at September 30, 2023. For additional information 
about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and 
exposure in Russia, see “Risk Factors” above and Note 2.

126

Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various 
risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, 
including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from 
retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its 
business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation 
events (see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” above). Examples of 
triggers that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank 
include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of 
control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, 
including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the 
complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee 
or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability 
to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior 
management. As of December 31, 2023, Citi continued to 
consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation 
factors were triggered.

In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for 
example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi’s foreign 
entity in Russia, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net 
investment of approximately $0.2 billion (compared to $1.0 
billion as of September 30, 2023), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of 
approximately $1.6 billion (unchanged from September 30, 
2023) through earnings, and (iii) recognize a loss of $0.6 
billion (unchanged from September 30, 2023) on 
intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi 
entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial 
liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be 
required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 
billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net 
investment as circumstances evolve.

Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients
Citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by 
various entities in Russia, including Russian corporate clients. 
Citi’s role as paying agent is administrative. In this role, Citi 
acts as an agent of its client, the bond issuer, receiving interest 
and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making 
payments to international central securities depositories (e.g., 
Depository Trust Company, Euroclear, Clearstream). The 
international central securities depositories (ICSDs) make 
payments to those participants or account holders (e.g., broker/
dealers) that have clients who are investors in the applicable 
bonds (i.e., bondholders). As a paying agent, Citi generally 
does not have information about the identity of the 
bondholders. Citi may be exposed to risks due to its 
responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on 
behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other 
governmental requirements and prohibitions. To mitigate 
operational and sanctions risks, Citi has established policies, 
procedures and controls for client relationships and payment 
processing to help ensure compliance with U.S., U.K., EU and 
other jurisdictions’ sanctions laws.

These processes may require Citi to delay or withhold the 

processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond 
issuer. Citi is also prevented from making payments to 
accounts on behalf of bondholders should the ICSDs disclose 
to Citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders. In both 
instances, Citi is generally required to segregate, restrict or 

block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the 
payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law.

Reputational Risks
Citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its 
reputation with its colleagues, clients, customers, investors, 
regulators and the public. Citi’s response to the war in 
Ukraine, including any action or inaction, may have a negative 
impact on Citi’s reputation with some or all of these parties.
For example, Citi is exposed to reputational risk as a 
result of its remaining presence in Russia and association with 
Russian individuals or entities, whether subject to sanctions or 
not, including Citi’s inability to support its global clients in 
Russia, which could adversely affect its broader client 
relationships and businesses; current involvement in 
transactions or supporting activities involving Russian assets 
or interests; failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and 
regulations, including those related to sanctions; perceived 
misalignment of Citi’s actions to its stated strategy in Russia; 
and the reputational impact from Citi’s activity and 
engagement with Ukraine or with non-Russian clients exiting 
their Russia businesses. 

While Citi announced its intention to wind down its 
businesses in Russia, Citi will continue to manage those 
operations during the wind-down process and will be required 
to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining 
legal and regulatory obligations. Also, sanctions and sanctions 
compliance are highly complex and may change over time and 
result in increased operational risk. Failure to fully comply 
with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where 
they should not be applied may negatively impact Citi’s 
reputation. In addition, Citi currently performs services for, 
conducts business with or deals in non-sanctioned Russian-
owned businesses and Russian assets. This has attracted, and 
will likely continue to attract, negative attention, despite the 
previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities 
in the country, cessation of new business and client 
originations, and reduction of other exposures.

Citi’s continued presence or divestiture of businesses in 

Russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks 
that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and 
customers, harm its reputation, increase its compliance costs 
and adversely affect its business operations and results of 
operations. For additional information on operational and 
cyber risks, see “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” above.

Board’s Role in Overseeing Related Risks
The Citi Board of Directors (Board) and the Board’s Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) and its other Committees 
have received and continue to receive regular reports from 
senior management regarding the war in Ukraine and its 
impact on Citi’s operations in Russia, Ukraine and elsewhere, 
as well as the war’s broader geopolitical, macroeconomic and 
reputational impacts. The reports to the Board and its 
Committees from senior management who represent the 
impacted businesses and the International region, Independent 
Risk Management, Finance, Independent Compliance Risk 
Management, including those individuals responsible for 
sanctions compliance, and Human Resources, have included 
detailed information regarding financial impacts, impacts on 

127

capital, cybersecurity, strategic considerations, sanctions 
compliance, employee assistance and reputational risks, 
enabling the Board and its Committees to properly exercise 
their oversight responsibilities. In addition, senior 
management has also provided updates to Citi’s Executive 
Management Team and the Board, outside of formal meetings, 
regarding Citi’s Russia-related risks, including with respect to 
cybersecurity matters.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war 
through its Services, Markets and Banking businesses, serving 
the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local 
financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs 
approximately 230 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s 
top priority. All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are 
conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the 
Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of December 
31, 2023, Citi had $1.5 billion of direct exposures related to 
Ukraine, unchanged from September 30, 2023. 

Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its Services, Markets and 
Banking businesses. As of December 31, 2023, Citi’s net 
investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.0 
billion (compared to $1.9 billion at September 30, 2023). Citi 
uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as the functional currency for its 
operations in countries such as Argentina that are deemed 
highly inflationary in accordance with GAAP. Citi therefore 
records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net 
Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated assets directly in 
earnings. Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate 
to remeasure its net ARS-denominated assets into USD. As of 
December 31, 2023, the official ARS exchange rate was 
808.48, which devalued by 57% against the USD during the 
fourth quarter of 2023.

The decline in Citi’s net investment in Argentina during 

the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily a result of 
approximately $880 million in translation losses in revenues 
due to devaluation of the ARS (approximately $1.9 billion in
aggregate translation losses in revenues for full-year 2023,
compared to approximately $820 million for full-year 2022). 
The decline in the net investment was also due to reserve 
builds in the quarter related to increases in transfer risk 
associated with exposures in Argentina driven by safety and 
soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. These 
reductions in the net investment were partially offset by 
aggregate other net income, consisting of net interest income 
in Argentina, and interest earned on the net investment, of 
which a significant portion is invested at high local overnight 
rates in Argentina.

The Central Bank of Argentina has continued to maintain 

certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict 
Citi’s ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings 
from its Argentine operations. Citi’s net investment in 
Argentina will therefore continue to be exposed to additional 
foreign currency translation losses to the extent it is 
denominated in ARS and is unable to be remitted or 
exchanged. Furthermore, the capital and currency controls 
have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that 

FFIEC—Cross-Border Claims on Third Parties and Local 
Country Assets
Citi’s cross-border disclosures are presented below, based on 
the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of 
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council 
(FFIEC). The following summarizes some of the key FFIEC 
reporting guidelines:

•

•

•

•

•

Amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate 
obligor, counterparty, collateral (only including qualifying 
liquid collateral), issuer or guarantor, as applicable (e.g., a 
security recorded by a Citi U.S. entity but issued by the 
U.K. government is considered U.K. exposure; a loan 
recorded by a Citi Mexico entity to a customer domiciled 
in Mexico where the underlying collateral is held in 
Germany is considered German exposure). 
Amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received 
for secured financing transactions (i.e., repurchase 
agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities 
loaned and borrowed) and are reported based on notional 
amounts. 
Netting of derivative receivables and payables, reported at 
fair value, is permitted, but only under a legally binding 
netting agreement with the same specific counterparty, 
and does not include the benefit of margin received or 
hedges.
Credit default swaps (CDS) are included based on the 
gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not 
include any offsetting CDS on the same underlying entity. 
Loans are reported without the benefit of hedges.

Given the requirements noted above, Citi’s FFIEC cross-
border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate, in 
some cases significantly, from period to period. As an 
example, because total outstandings under FFIEC guidelines 
do not include the benefit of margin or hedges, market 
volatility in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit 
spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total 
outstandings, all else being equal.

some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, generally at 
rates that are significantly higher than Argentina’s official 
exchange rate. Citibank Argentina is precluded from accessing 
these alternative mechanisms, and under U.S. GAAP, these 
exchange mechanisms cannot be used to re-measure Citi’s net 
monetary assets into USD. If Argentina’s official exchange 
rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by 
the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur 
additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina. 
Accordingly, Citi seeks to reduce its overall ARS exposure in 
Argentina while complying with local capital and currency 
exposure limitations.

Of the $1.0 billion net investment in Argentina as of 

December 31, 2023, Citi’s net ARS exposure was 
approximately $0.4 billion. The net ARS exposure is reduced 
as a result of Citi holding approximately $100 million of USD-
denominated loans as well as approximately $500 million of 
certain local government bonds that are indexed to the higher 
of the USD exchange rate or the local inflation index. If Citi 
had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ARS 
exposure, Citi would have recognized additional translation 
losses during the fourth quarter of 2023. Given current 
economic conditions and the local capital, currency and 
regulatory limitations, Citi cannot guarantee the availability or 
effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ARS exposure 
in the future.

In addition to reducing the ARS exposure, Citi also seeks 
to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and 
prudent using non-deliverable forward (NDF) derivative 
instruments that are primarily executed outside of Argentina. 
As of December 31, 2023, the international NDF market had 
very limited liquidity, resulting in Citi’s inability to 
economically hedge its remaining net ARS exposure. 
Accordingly, and to the extent that Citi does not execute NDF 
contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future, Citi would 
record devaluations on its net ARS-denominated assets in 
earnings, without any benefit from a change in the fair value 
of derivative positions used to economically hedge the 
exposure. Citi cannot predict the availability of hedging 
instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign 
exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings.

Citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its 
Argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit 
risk and records mark-to-market adjustments for relevant 
market risks associated with its Argentine assets. Citi believes 
it has established an appropriate ACL on its Argentine loans, 
and appropriate fair value adjustments on Argentine assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value, for credit and sovereign risks 
under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2023. For additional 
information on Citi’s emerging markets risks, including those 
related to its Argentine exposures, see “Risk Factors—
Strategic Risks” above.
