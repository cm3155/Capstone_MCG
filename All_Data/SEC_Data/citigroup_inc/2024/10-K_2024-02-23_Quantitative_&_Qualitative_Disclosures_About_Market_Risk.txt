5.  COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION 
AND OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES

Commissions and Fees
The primary components of Commissions and fees revenue are 
investment banking fees, brokerage commissions, credit card 
and bank card income and deposit-related fees. 

Investment banking fees are substantially composed of 
underwriting and advisory revenues. Such fees are recognized 
at the point in time when Citigroup’s performance under the 
terms of a contractual arrangement is completed, which is 
typically at the closing of a transaction. Reimbursed expenses 
related to these transactions are recorded as revenue and are 
included within investment banking fees. In certain instances 
for advisory contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of 
the deal’s closing. In these instances, the amounts received 
will be recognized as a liability and not recognized in revenue 
until the transaction closes. Investment banking fees are 
earned primarily by Banking and Markets. See Note 3 for 
segment results.

Out-of-pocket expenses associated with underwriting 
activity are deferred and recognized at the time the related 
revenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket expenses 
associated with advisory arrangements are expensed as 
incurred. In general, expenses incurred related to investment 
banking transactions, whether consummated or not, are 
recorded in Other operating expenses. The Company has 
determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these 
transactions and therefore presents expenses gross within 
Other operating expenses.

Brokerage commissions primarily include commissions 

and fees from the following: executing transactions for clients 
on exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual 
funds and other annuity products; and assisting clients in 
clearing transactions, providing brokerage services and other 
such activities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in 
Commissions and fees at the point in time the associated 
service is fulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. 
Certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and 
exchanges are recorded net against commission revenue, as 
the Company is an agent for those services. Sales of certain 
investment products include a portion of variable 
consideration associated with the underlying product. In these 
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of 
the product is not recognized until the variable consideration 
becomes fixed and determinable. Brokerage commissions are 
earned primarily by Markets and Wealth. See Note 3 for 
segment results. 

Credit card and bank card income is primarily composed 
of interchange fees, which are earned by card issuers based on 
card spend volumes, and certain card fees, including annual 
fees. Costs related to customer reward programs and certain 
payments to partners (primarily based on program sales, 
profitability and customer acquisitions) are recorded as a 
reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi’s credit 
card programs have certain partner sharing agreements that 
vary by partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject 
to contractually based performance thresholds that, if met, 
would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. 
The threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is 

172

generally calculated based on predefined program revenues 
less predefined program expenses. In most of Citi’s partner 
sharing agreements, program expenses include net credit 
losses, which, to the extent that the increase in net credit losses 
reduces Citi’s liability for the partners’ share for a given 
program year, would generally result in lower payments to 
partners in total for that year and vice versa. Further, in some 
instances, other partner payments are based on program sales 
and new account acquisitions. Interchange revenues are 
recognized as earned on a daily basis when Citi’s performance 
obligation to transmit funds to the payment networks has been 
satisfied. Annual card fees, net of origination costs, are 
deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-
month period. Costs related to card reward programs are 
recognized when the rewards are earned by the cardholders. 
Payments to partners are recognized when incurred. Credit 
card and bank card income is earned primarily by USPB and 
Services. See Note 3 for segment results.

Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on deposit 
accounts and fees earned from performing cash management 
activities and other deposit account services. Such fees are 
recognized in the period in which the related service is 
provided. Deposit-related fees are earned primarily by 
Services and USPB. See Note 3 for segment results.

Transactional service fees primarily consist of fees 
charged for processing services such as cash management, 
global payments, clearing, international funds transfer and 
other trade services. Such fees are recognized as/when the 
associated service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the 
point in time the service is requested by the customer and 
provided by Citi. Transactional service fees are earned 
primarily by Services. See Note 3 for segment results.

Insurance distribution revenue consists of commissions 
earned from third-party insurance companies for marketing 
and selling insurance policies on behalf of such entities. Such 
commissions are recognized in Commissions and fees at the 
point in time the associated service is fulfilled, generally when 
the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder. Sales of 
certain insurance products include a portion of variable 
consideration associated with the underlying product. In these 
instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the sale of 
the policy is not recognized until the variable consideration 
becomes fixed and determinable. The Company recognized 
$188 million, $201 million and $260 million of revenue 
related to such variable consideration for the years ended 
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These 
amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied 
in prior periods. Insurance distribution revenue is earned 
primarily by Wealth and Legacy Franchises within All Other. 
See Note 3 for segment results.

Insurance premiums consist of premium income from 

insurance policies that Citi has underwritten and sold to 
policyholders. Insurance premiums are earned primarily by 
Legacy Franchises within All Other. See Note 3 for segment 
results.

Administration and Other Fiduciary Fees
Administration and other fiduciary fees revenue is primarily 
composed of custody fees and fiduciary fees.

The custody product is composed of numerous services 
related to the administration, safekeeping and reporting for 
both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The services 
offered to clients include trade settlement, safekeeping, 
income collection, corporate action notification, record-
keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management. 
These services are provided for a wide range of securities, 
including but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate 
bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market 
instruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative 
instruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and 
precious metals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the 
associated promised service is satisfied, which normally 
occurs at the point in time the service is requested by the 
customer and provided by Citi. Custody fees are earned 
primarily by Services. See Note 3 for segment results.

In millions of dollars

Custody fees

Fiduciary fees

Guarantee fees
Total administration and other fiduciary fees(1)

Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and investment 

management services. As an escrow agent, Citi receives, 
safekeeps, services and manages clients’ escrowed assets, such 
as cash, securities, property (including intellectual property), 
contracts or other collateral. Citi performs its escrow agent 
duties by safekeeping the assets during the specified time 
period agreed upon by all parties and therefore earns its 
revenue evenly during the contract duration. Investment 
management services consist of managing assets on behalf of 
Citi’s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from these 
services primarily consists of asset-based fees for advisory 
accounts, which are based on the market value of the client’s 
assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is 
fixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-
party advisors and with third-party custodians. The Company 
has determined that it acts as principal in the majority of these 
transactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third 
parties gross within Other operating expenses. Fiduciary fees 
are earned primarily by Wealth and Legacy Franchises within 
All Other. See Note 3 for segment results.

6.  PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS

Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and 
unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. Trading 
activities include revenues from fixed income, equities, credit 
and commodities products and foreign exchange transactions 
that are managed on a portfolio basis and characterized below 
based on the primary risk managed by each trading desk (as 
such, the trading desks can be periodically reorganized and 
thus the risk categories). Not included in the table below is the 
impact of net interest income related to trading activities, 
which is an integral part of trading activities’ profitability (see 

Note 4 for information about net interest income related to 
trading activities). Principal transactions include CVA (credit 
valuation adjustments) and FVA (funding valuation 
adjustments) on over-the-counter derivatives, and gains 
(losses) on certain economic hedges on loans in Services, 
Markets and Banking. These adjustments are discussed further 
in Note 26. 

In certain transactions, Citi incurs fees and presents these 

fees paid to third parties in operating expenses.

(1)   The above tables do not include securities-for-securities lending 

transactions of $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively, where the Company acts as lender and receives 
securities that can be sold or pledged as collateral. In these transactions, 
the Company recognizes the securities received at fair value within 
Other assets and the obligation to return those securities as a liability 
within Brokerage payables. 

(2)  See Note 16.

The resale and repurchase agreements represent 
collateralized financing transactions. Citi executes these 
transactions primarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to 
facilitate customer matched-book activity and to efficiently 
fund a portion of Citi’s trading inventory. Transactions 
executed by Citi’s bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate 
customer financing activity.

To maintain reliable funding under a wide range of 

market conditions, including under periods of stress, Citi 
manages these activities by taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing 
tenor. Citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing 
transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for 
changes in capacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and 
client actions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty 
diversification by establishing concentration triggers and 
assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.
It is the Company’s policy to take possession of the 
underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the 
amounts due under the agreements and, when necessary, 

196

require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection. For resale and 
repurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts 
additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin 
protection. 

Collateral typically consists of government and 

government-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds, 
equities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities.
The resale and repurchase agreements are generally 
documented under industry standard agreements that allow the 
prompt close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation 
of securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return 
cash or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a 
payment default or other type of default under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default generally include 
(i) failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the 
transaction, (ii) failure to provide or return cash or securities 
as used for margining purposes, (iii) breach of representation, 
(iv) cross-default to another transaction entered into among the 
parties, or, in some cases, their affiliates, and (v) a repudiation 
of obligations under the agreement. The counterparty that 
receives the securities in these transactions is generally 
unrestricted in its use of the securities, with the exception of 
transactions executed on a tri-party basis, where the collateral 
is maintained by a custodian and operational limitations may 
restrict its use of the securities.

A substantial portion of the resale and repurchase 
agreements is recorded at fair value as the Company elected 
the fair value option, as described in Notes 26 and 27. The 
remaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially 
advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the 
respective agreements.

The securities borrowing and lending agreements also 
represent collateralized financing transactions similar to the 
resale and repurchase agreements. Collateral typically consists 
of government and government-agency securities and 
corporate debt and equity securities.

Similar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities 

borrowing and lending agreements are generally documented 
under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt 
close-out of all transactions (including the liquidation of 
securities held) and the offsetting of obligations to return cash 
or securities by the non-defaulting party, following a payment 
default or other default by the other party under the relevant 
master agreement. Events of default and rights to use 
securities under the securities borrowing and lending 
agreements are similar to the resale and repurchase agreements 
referenced above.

A substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending 

agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or 
received. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the 
Company elected the fair value option for certain securities 
borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 27. With 
respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash 
collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value 
of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market 
value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily 
basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order to 
maintain contractual margin protection.

 
 
 
The enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements for resale and repurchase 
agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, 
is evidenced to the extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion 
has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that 
provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the 
enforceability of these agreements and (ii) the exercise of 
rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close out 
transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be 
stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of 
default including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar 
proceeding.

A legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for 

certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently 
ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights 
or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast 
doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 

law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or 
unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For example, this 
may be the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central 
banks and U.S. pension plans.

The following tables present the gross and net resale and 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending 
agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under 
ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts related to 
financial instruments that are not permitted to be offset under

13.  BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE 
PAYABLES

The Company has receivables and payables for financial 
instruments sold to and purchased from brokers, dealers and 
customers, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Citi 
is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers, dealers 
or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial 
instruments sold, in which case Citi would have to sell or 
purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. 
Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or 
clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction 
and replaces the broker, dealer or customer in question.

Citi seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with 

customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin 
collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal 
guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers 
deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers 
cannot meet collateral requirements, Citi may liquidate 
sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the 
customer into compliance with the required margin level.

Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, 

which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their 
obligations to Citi. Credit limits are established and closely 
monitored for customers and for brokers and dealers engaged 
in forwards, futures and other transactions deemed to be credit 
sensitive. 

Brokerage receivables and Brokerage payables consisted

(3)

Impairment losses and adjustments to the carrying value as a result of observable price changes are recognized in earnings. See “Non-Marketable Equity 
Securities Not Carried at Fair Value” below.

(4) Represents shares issued by the Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Banks and certain exchanges of which Citigroup is a member.
(5)

Includes $25 million and $27 million of investments in funds for which the fair values are estimated using the net asset value of the Company’s ownership interest 
in the funds at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(6) Not included in the balances above is approximately $2 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which is included in Other assets on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable for AFS and HTM debt securities, 
consistent with its non-accrual policy, which results in timely write-off of accrued interest. The Company did not reverse through interest income any accrued 
interest receivables for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

(1) The Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which are typically issued by VIEs through securitization transactions. The Company’s maximum 
exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in the table above. See Note 23 for mortgage- and asset-
backed securitizations in which the Company has other involvement.
In January 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-01. Upon adoption, Citi transferred $3.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities from HTM classification to AFS 
classification as allowed under the ASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $0.1 billion, which was recorded in AOCI 
upon transfer. See Note 1. 

(2)

(3) Amortized cost includes unallocated portfolio layer cumulative basis adjustments of $0.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. Gross unrealized gains and gross 

unrealized (losses) on mortgage-backed securities excluding the effect of unallocated portfolio layer cumulative basis adjustments were $368 million and 
$(683) million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.

At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of AFS debt 

securities for those in a loss position exceeded their fair value 
by $3,794 million. Of the $3,794 million, $861 million 
represented unrealized losses on AFS debt securities that have 
been in a gross unrealized loss position for less than a year 
and, of these, 82% were rated investment grade; and 
$2,933 million represented unrealized losses on AFS debt 
securities that have been in a gross unrealized loss position for 
a year or more and, of these, 96% were rated investment 
grade. Of the $2,933 million, $1,269 million represents U.S. 
Treasury and federal agency securities.

in which the Company has other involvement.
In January 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-01. Upon adoption, Citi transferred $3.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities from HTM classification to AFS 
classification as allowed under the ASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of $0.1 billion, which was recorded in AOCI 
upon transfer. See Note 1.

The Company has the positive intent and ability to hold 

these securities to maturity or, where applicable, until the 
exercise of any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen 
significant changes in circumstances, including deterioration 
in credit or changes in regulatory capital requirements.

The net unrealized losses classified in AOCI for HTM 
debt securities primarily relate to debt securities previously 
classified as AFS that were transferred to HTM, and include 
any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments. The net 
unrealized loss amount also includes any non-credit-related 
changes in fair value of HTM debt securities that have 
suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The AOCI 
balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an 
adjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion 
of any difference between the carrying value at the transfer 
date and par value of the same debt securities.

Evaluating Investments for Impairment—AFS Debt 
Securities

Overview
The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt 
securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the 
impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other 
factors and to evaluate the Company’s intent to sell such 
securities.

An AFS debt security is impaired when the current fair 

value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its 
amortized cost basis.

The Company recognizes the entire difference between 
amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired 
AFS debt securities that Citi has an intent to sell or for which 
Citi believes it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell 
prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. However, for 
those AFS debt securities that the Company does not intend to 
sell and is not likely to be required to sell, only the credit-
related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an 
allowance for credit losses. Any remaining fair value decline 
for such securities is recorded in AOCI. The Company does 
not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security 
is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss 
exists.

For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist where Citi 
does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest 
cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
of a security. The allowance for credit losses is limited to the 
amount by which the AFS debt security’s amortized cost basis 
exceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased 
if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals 
of credit losses are recognized in earnings.

The Company’s review for impairment of AFS debt 

securities generally entails:

•
•

•

identification and evaluation of impaired investments;
consideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation 
of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions 
to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not 
support credit impairment; and
documentation of the results of these analyses, as required 
under business policies.

The sections below describe the Company’s process for 
identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types 
that have the most significant unrealized losses as of 
December 31, 2023.

Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
Citi records no allowances for credit losses on U.S. 
government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, 
because the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the 
event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses 
and due to the nature of the counterparties.

State and Municipal Securities
The process for estimating credit losses in Citigroup’s AFS 
state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit 
analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings. Citi 
monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default 
protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance. The 
average external credit rating, disregarding any insurance, is 
Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other 
indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-
specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer 
default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse 
changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual 
principal and interest payments.

For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses 

that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be 
required to sell prior to recovery of value, the full impairment 
is recognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds 
where Citi has no intent to sell and it is not more-likely-than-
not that the Company will be required to sell, Citi records an 
allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects 
not to collect, capped at the difference between the bond’s 
amortized cost basis and fair value.

Equity Method Investments
Management assesses equity method investments that have 
fair values that are less than their respective carrying values 
for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is 
measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has 
publicly listed securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, 
other methods are used (see Note 26).

For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to 

sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not 
be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will 
recover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is 
recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity 
and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include 
partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet 
date.

For impaired equity method investments that management 

does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not to be 
required to sell prior to recovery of value, the evaluation of 
whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is based on 
(i) whether and when an equity method investment will 
recover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent 
and ability to hold that investment for a period of time 
sufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether 
the impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers 
the following indicators:

•

•

•

the cause of the impairment and the financial condition 
and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any 
specific events that may influence the operations of the 
issuer;
the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of 
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in 
market value; and
the length of time and extent to which fair value has been 
less than the carrying value.

A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-
marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the years 
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no impairment 
loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity 
securities carried at cost.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at 
Fair Value
Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured 
at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the 
investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal 
Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue 
to be carried at cost. 

The election to measure a non-marketable equity security 

using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-
by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an 
equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes 
resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the 
identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The 
carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value 
on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ 
from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, 
including marketability adjustments and differences in rights 
and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Equity securities under the measurement alternative are 

also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, 
management qualitatively assesses whether each equity 
security under the measurement alternative is impaired. 
Impairment indicators that are considered include, but are not 
limited to, the following:

•

•

•

•

•

a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, 
credit rating, asset quality or business prospects of the 
investee;
a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic 
or technological environment of the investee;
a significant adverse change in the general market 
condition of either the geographical area or the industry in 
which the investee operates;
a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to 
sell or a completed auction process for the same or similar 
investment for an amount less than the carrying amount of 
that investment; and
factors that raise significant concerns about the investee’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative 
cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies 
or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or 
debt covenants.

When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity 

security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair 
value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the 
investment is written down to fair value through earnings.

method hedges of mortgage and real estate loans, which are not

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale 
$5.7 billion and $5.0 billion of corporate loans during the 
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 
Company did not have significant purchases of corporate loans 
classified as held-for-investment for the years ended 
December 31, 2023 or 2022.

Lease Financing 
Citi is a lessor in the power, railcars, shipping and aircraft 
sectors, where the Company has executed operating, direct 
financing and leveraged leases. Citi’s $0.3 billion of lease 
financing receivables, as of December 31, 2023, is composed 
of approximately equal balances of direct financing lease 
receivables and net investments in leveraged leases. Citi uses 
the interest rate implicit in the lease to determine the present 
value of its lease financing receivables. Interest income on 
direct financing and leveraged leases during the year ended 
December 31, 2023 was not material.

The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessor, 
are not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Delinquency Status
Citi generally does not manage corporate loans on a 
delinquency basis. Corporate loans are placed on a cash (non-
accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual 
experience and a forward-looking assessment of the 
collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or 
principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90 
days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and 
in the process of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired 
corporate loans and leases is reversed at 90 days and charged 
against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in 
earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When 
there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, 
all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded 
investment in the loan. While corporate loans are generally 
managed based on their internally assigned risk rating (see 
further discussion below), the following tables present 
delinquency information by corporate loan type. 

15.  LOANS

Citigroup loans are reported in two categories: corporate and 
consumer. These categories are classified primarily according 
to the operating segment, reporting unit and component that 
manage the loans in addition to the nature of the obligor, with 
corporate loans generally made for corporate institutional and 
public sector clients around the world and consumer loans to 
retail and small business customers.

Corporate Loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by 
Services, Markets, Banking and the Mexico SBMM 
component of All Other—Legacy Franchises. The following

certain direct origination costs, that are deferred and recognized as 
Interest income over the lives of the related loans. 

(4) Not included in the balances above is approximately $2 billion of 

accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which is 
included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

(5) Accrued interest receivable considered to be uncollectible is reversed 
through interest income. Amounts reversed were not material for the 
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(1) Corporate loans that are 90 days past due are generally classified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past due when principal or interest is 

contractually due but unpaid.

(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90 days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes, based on actual experience and a forward-

looking assessment of the collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of interest and/or principal is doubtful.

(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.
(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which are not included in the various delinquency columns and, therefore, the tables’ total rows will not cross-

foot. 

(5) Excludes $93 million of unallocated portfolio layer cumulative basis adjustments at December 31, 2023.

Citigroup has a risk management process to monitor, 
evaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its 
corporate loan portfolio. As part of its risk management 
process, Citi assigns numeric risk ratings to its corporate loan 
facilities based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of 
the obligor and facility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least 
annually or more often if material events related to the obligor 
or facility warrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk 
ratings include financial condition of the obligor, qualitative 
assessment of management and strategy, amount and sources 
of repayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee 
arrangements, amount and type of any contingencies 
associated with the obligor and the obligor’s industry and 
geography.

The obligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default 

probabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges of 
loss norms, which are the product of the probability of default 
and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating 
categories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as 
defined by S&P and Moody’s. Loans classified according to 
the bank regulatory definitions as special mention, 
substandard, doubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the 
non-investment-grade categories.

Collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment is 

expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying 
collateral with no other available and reliable sources of 
repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying value or 
collateral value, less cost to sell. Cash-basis loans are returned 
to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest 
amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a 
sustained period of repayment performance, generally six 
months, in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.

Corporate Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
Citi seeks to modify certain corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to reduce Citi’s exposure to loss, often 
providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties. Each modification is unique to the borrower’s 
individual circumstances. The following table details corporate loan modifications granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 
to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications. Citi 
defines a corporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of a loan classified as 
substandard or worse at the time of modification.

values of loans by class of receivable as of December 31, 2023.

(2) Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications totaled $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023.
(3) The allowance for corporate loans, including modified loans, is based on the borrower’s overall financial performance. Charge-offs for amounts deemed 

uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the modification or may have already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of 
modification.

(4) Payment delays either for principal or interest payments had an immaterial financial impact. 
(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.

The following table presents the Company’s corporate troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), under previous GAAP, prior to the

(1) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal payments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of periodic and/or final principal payments. 
Because forgiveness of principal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically have little to no impact on the loans’ projected cash flows and thus little to no 
impact on the allowance established for the loans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be recorded at the time of the restructuring or may have 
already been recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is required at the time of the modification.
(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest payments may involve a below-market interest rate.
(3) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and loans to government and official institutions.

Defaults of Modified Corporate Loans
No modified corporate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Default is defined as 60 days past due, except for classifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is defined as 90 days 
past due. For a modified corporate loan that is not collateral dependent, expected default rates are considered in the loan’s individually 
assessed ACL.

The following table presents the Company’s corporate TDRs at December 31, 2022, under previous GAAP, prior to the 

Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, that defaulted for which the payment default occurred within one year 
of a permanent modification. Default is defined as 60 days past due:

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed primarily 
by USPB, Wealth and All Other—Legacy Franchises (except 
Mexico SBMM). 

Citigroup has established a risk management process to 
monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks associated 
with its consumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that 
are actively monitored include delinquency status, consumer 
credit scores under Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) and loan-to-
value (LTV) ratios, each as discussed in more detail below.

Delinquency Status
Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key 
indicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the 
U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers 
Association (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which 
considers a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been 
received by the end of the day immediately preceding the 
loan’s next due date. All other loans use a method of reporting 
delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly 
payment has not been received by the close of business on the 
loan’s next due date.

As a general policy, residential first mortgages, home 
equity loans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual 
when loan payments are 90 days contractually past due. Credit 
cards and unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest 
until payments are 180 days past due. Home equity loans in 
regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual if the 
related residential first mortgage is 90 days or more past due. 
Mortgage loans, other than Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA)–insured loans, are classified as non-accrual within 60 
days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. 

The policy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to 

current status varies by product. Generally, one of the 
conditions to qualify for these modifications is that a 
minimum number of payments (typically ranging from one to 
three) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to 
current status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-
ended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by 
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 
guidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC 
guidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to 
current status is that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, must be 
received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of 
times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations 
(generally once in 12 months and twice in five years). 

Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs 

(VA) loans are modified under those respective agencies’ 
guidelines and payments are not always required in order to 
re-age a modified loan to current.

The tables below present details about these loans, 

including the following loan categories:

•

•

•

Residential first mortgages and Home equity loans 
primarily represent secured mortgage lending to 
customers of Retail Banking and Wealth.
Credit cards primarily represent unsecured credit card 
lending to customers of Branded Cards and Retail 
Services.
Personal, small business and other loans are primarily 
composed of classifiably managed loans to customers of 
Wealth (mainly within the Private Bank) who are 
typically high credit quality borrowers that historically 
experienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. 
Loans to these borrowers are generally well collateralized 
in the form of liquid securities and other forms of 
collateral.

(9) As of December 31, 2023, Wealth in North America includes $31.6 billion of loans, of which $29.2 billion are classifiably managed with 92% rated investment 

grade, and Wealth outside North America includes $24.9 billion of loans, of which $17.0 billion are classifiably managed with 74% rated investment grade. As of 
December 31, 2022, Wealth in North America includes $34.0 billion of loans, of which $31.5 billion are classifiably managed with 98% rated investment grade, 
and Wealth outside North America includes $26.6 billion of loans, of which $17.8 billion are classifiably managed with 94% rated investment grade. Such loans

included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for credit card loans (which include accrued interest and fees). During the years ended 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reversed accrued interest (primarily related to credit cards) of approximately $1.1 billion and $0.6 billion, 
respectively. These reversals of accrued interest are reflected as a reduction to Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.

During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the 
Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-sale (HFS) 
approximately $2,166 million and $582 million of consumer 
loans, respectively. The increase was largely due to the 
reclassification of a mortgage portfolio to HFS in the first 
quarter of 2023 that was subsequently sold in the second 
quarter of 2023. The Company did not have significant 
purchases of consumer loans classified as held-for-investment 
during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Loans 
held by a business for sale are not included in the above since 
they have been reclassified to Other assets. See Note 2 for 
additional information regarding Citigroup’s businesses held-
for-sale.

Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
In the U.S., independent credit agencies rate an individual’s 
risk for assuming debt based on the individual’s credit history 
and assign every consumer a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) 
credit score. These scores are continually updated by the 
agencies based on an individual’s credit actions (e.g., taking 
out a loan or missed or late payments).

The following tables provide details on the FICO scores 
for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period 
receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated 
monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on 
a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did 
not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated 
with FICO scores as they become available.

With respect to Citi’s consumer loan portfolio outside of 
the U.S. as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 ($77.5 billion and 
$80.5 billion, respectively), various country-specific or 
regional credit risk metrics and acquisition and behavior 
scoring models are leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate 
the credit quality of customers (see “Consumer Loans and 
Ratios Outside of North America” below). As a result, details 
of relevant credit quality indicators for those loans are not 
comparable to the below FICO score distribution for the U.S. 
portfolio.

Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios—U.S. Consumer Mortgages
LTV ratios (loan balance divided by appraised value) are 
calculated at origination and updated by applying market price 
data.

The following tables provide details on the LTV ratios for 

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage portfolios by year of 
origination. LTV ratios are updated monthly using the most 
recent Core Logic Home Price Index data available for 
substantially all of the portfolio, applied at the Metropolitan 
Statistical Area level, if available, or the state level if not. The 
remainder of the portfolio is updated in a similar manner using 
the Federal Housing Finance Agency indices.

Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing 
Financial Difficulty
Citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses, avoid 
foreclosure or repossession of collateral, and ultimately 
maximize payments received from the borrowers. Citi uses 
various metrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty, with the primary indicator being 
delinquency at the time of modification. Citi’s significant 
consumer modification programs are described below.

Credit Cards
Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification 
programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the 
interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed 
payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the 
customer’s available line of credit. Citi also grants 
modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-
party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure 
customers’ entire unsecured debt. In both circumstances, if the 
cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, 
the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be 
charged off in accordance with Citi’s standard charge-off 
policy. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an 
outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount. 

Residential Mortgages
Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its 
residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party 
subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers 
who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering 
interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, 
term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled 
in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended 
until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before 
permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a 
mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the 
borrower. Trial modifications generally represent a three-
month period during which the borrower makes monthly 
payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. 
These loans continue to age and accrue interest in accordance 
with their original contractual terms. Upon successful 
completion of the trial period, and the borrower’s formal 
acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter 
into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of 
loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a 
permanent modification. During the year ended December 31, 
2023, $21 million of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial 
programs. Mortgage loans of $7 million had gone through 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the year ended December 31, 
2023.

(1)  The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Citi granted forgiveness of 
$50 million in credit card loans and $2 million in personal, small business and other loans. As a result, there were no outstanding balances as of December 31, 
2023. 

(2)  Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications included in the table above were immaterial at December 31, 

2023.

(3)  For major consumer portfolios, the ACLL is based on macroeconomic-sensitive models that rely on historical performance and macroeconomic scenarios to 

forecast expected credit losses. Modifications of consumer loans impact expected credit losses by affecting the likelihood of default..

(4)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(5)  Excludes residential first mortgages discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the year ended December 31, 2023.

(1) The above table does not include loan modifications that meet the TDR relief criteria in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) or 

the interagency guidance.

(2) Post-modification balances include past-due amounts that are capitalized at the modification date.
(3) Post-modification balances in North America include $5 million of residential first mortgages to borrowers who have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the 
year ended December 31, 2022. These amounts include $3.8 million of residential first mortgages that were newly classified as TDRs during 2022, based on 
previously received OCC guidance. The remaining amounts were already classified as TDRs before being discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

(4) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing, but still due from the borrower. Such deferred principal is charged off at the time 

of permanent modification to the extent that the related loan balance exceeds the underlying collateral value.

(5) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that is non-interest bearing and, depending on borrower performance, eligible for forgiveness.
(6) Represents the portion of contractual loan principal that was forgiven at the time of permanent modification.
(7) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.

(1)  North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(2)  Typically, upon modification a loan re-ages to current. However, FFIEC guidelines for re-aging certain loans require that at least three consecutive minimum 
monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, be received. In these cases, the loan will remain delinquent until the payment criteria for re-aging have been 
satisfied.

(3)  Loans modified under Citi’s COVID-19 consumer relief programs continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of 

modification.

Defaults of Modified Consumer Loans

Corporate ACLL
Citi’s total corporate ACLL as of December 31, 2023 was 
$2,714 million, a decrease from $2,855 million at 
December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by an 
improved macroeconomic outlook.

ACLUC
As of December 31, 2023, Citi’s total ACLUC, included in 
Other liabilities, was $1,728 million, a decrease from $2,151 
million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily 
driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook.

2023 Changes in the ACL
The total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and 
unfunded lending commitments as of December 31, 2023 was 
$19,873 million, an increase from $19,125 million at 
December 31, 2022. The increase in the ACLL was primarily 
driven by card balances in Branded Cards and Retail Services 
and an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures 
outside the U.S. driven by safety and soundness considerations 
under U.S. banking law, partially offset by a decrease in the 
ACLL of $352 million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for 
the recognition and measurement of TDRs (see Note 1) and 
improved key macroeconomic variable forecasts.

Consumer ACLL
Citi’s total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans 
(ACLL) as of December 31, 2023 was $15,431 million, an 
increase from $14,119 million at December 31, 2022. The 
increase was primarily driven by growth in U.S. cards 
balances, partially offset by a decrease to the ACLL of 
$352 million from the adoption of ASU 2022-02 for the 
recognition and measurement of TDRs.

(1) 

In 2023, goodwill of approximately $537 million was transferred from Banking to Markets related to business realignment. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation. See Note 3.

(2)  Represents goodwill allocated to the Asia Consumer banking exit markets upon the signing of the respective sales agreements: in 2021, related to the Australia 

and Philippines consumer banking businesses, which were reclassified as HFS during 2021; in 2022, related to the India, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, 
Bahrain and Vietnam consumer banking businesses, which were reclassified as HFS during 2022. See Note 2.

(3)  Goodwill impairment of $535 million (approximately $489 million after-tax) was incurred in the Asia Consumer reporting unit of Legacy Franchises in the first 

quarter of 2022, due to the resegmentation and change of reporting units as well as the sequence of the signing of sale agreements.

While the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the 

key assumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the 
economic and business environments continue to evolve as 
management implements its organizational simplification. If 
management’s future estimates of key economic and market 
assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions, Citi 
could potentially experience material goodwill impairment 
charges in the future.

For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill 
impairment testing process, see Note 1 for Citi’s accounting 
policy for goodwill and Note 3 for a description of Citi’s 
operating segments.

Citi performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of 
October 1, 2023, which resulted in no impairment of any of 
Citi’s reporting units’ goodwill.

As discussed in Note 3, effective in the fourth quarter of 

2023, as part of its organizational simplification, Citi made 
changes to its management structure, which resulted in 
changes in its operating segments and reporting units to reflect 
how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, 
manages the Company, including allocating resources and 
measuring performance.

The reorganization of Citi’s segment structure, including 

the change of management, and the business realignment 
between Banking and Markets were identified as triggering 
events for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. Consistent 
with the requirements of ASC 350, additional interim goodwill 
impairment tests were performed as of December 13, 2023, 
which resulted in no impairment during the fourth quarter of 
2023. Additionally, goodwill was reallocated from Banking to 
Markets related to the business realignment based on their 
relative fair values using the valuation performed as of the 
effective date of the reorganization. No additional triggering 
events were identified and no goodwill was impaired during 
2023.

The Company issues both fixed- and variable-rate debt in a 
range of currencies. It uses derivative contracts, primarily 
interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-
rate debt to variable-rate debt. In addition, the Company uses 
other derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange 
impact of certain debt issuances. At December 31, 2023, the 
Company’s overall weighted-average interest rate for long-
term debt, excluding structured notes accounted for at fair 
value, was 4.17% on a contractual basis and 4.22% including 
the effects of derivative contracts.

23.  SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST 
ENTITIES 

Uses of Special Purpose Entities
A special purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a 
specific limited need of the company that organized it. The 
principal uses of SPEs by Citi are to assist clients in 
securitizing their financial assets and create investment 
products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital 
efficiency by securitizing certain of Citi’s financial assets. 
SPEs may be organized in various legal forms, including 
trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization, through 
the SPE’s issuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, 
commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness, the company 
transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a portion) of 
those assets into cash before they would have been realized in 
the normal course of business. These issuances are recorded 
on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may or may not be 
consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that 
organized the SPE.

Investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the 
SPE, but may also benefit from other credit enhancements, 
such as a collateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity 
facility, such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase 
agreement. Because of these enhancements, the SPE issuances 
typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the 
transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances. This results 
in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The 
SPE may also enter into derivative contracts in order to 
convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match 
the needs of the SPE investors or to limit or change the credit 
risk of the SPE. Citigroup may be the provider of certain credit 
enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related 
derivative contracts.

Most of Citigroup’s SPEs are variable interest entities 

(VIEs). 

Variable Interest Entities
VIEs are described in Note 1. Investors that finance the VIE 
through debt or equity interests or other counterparties 
providing other forms of support, such as guarantees, certain 
fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts, are 
variable interest holders in the entity.

The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling 

financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. 

The Company must evaluate each VIE to understand the 
purpose and design of the entity, the role the Company had in 
the entity’s design and its involvement in the VIE’s ongoing 
activities. The Company then must evaluate which activities 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
VIE and who has the power to direct such activities.

For those VIEs where the Company determines that it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance, the Company must then 
evaluate its economic interests, if any, and determine whether 
it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially 
be significant to the VIE. When evaluating whether the 
Company has an obligation to absorb losses that could 
potentially be significant, it considers the maximum exposure 
to such loss without consideration of probability. Such 
obligations could be in various forms, including, but not 
limited to, debt and equity investments, guarantees, liquidity 
agreements and certain derivative contracts.

In various other transactions, the Company may (i) act as 

a derivative counterparty (e.g., interest rate swap, cross-
currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit 
default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the 
total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as underwriter 
or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative, trustee or 
other services or (iv) make a market in debt securities or other 
instruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers 
such involvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and 
thus not an indicator of power or potentially significant 
benefits or losses.

certain investment funds for which the Company provides 
investment management services and personal estate 
trusts for which the Company provides administrative, 
trustee and/or investment management services;
certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to 
which the Company provides secured credit facilities. The 
Company has no decision-making power and does not 
consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the 
definition of a VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure 
to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related 
commitment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the 
Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these 
transactions was $8.5 billion and $33.6 billion, 
respectively (see Notes 15 and 26 for more information on 
these positions);
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the 
Company holds securities in inventory, as these 
investments are made on arm’s-length terms; 
certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities 
held by the Company, which are classified as Trading 
account assets or Investments, in which the Company has 
no other involvement with the related securitization entity 
deemed to be significant (see Notes 14 and 26 for more 
information on these positions); 
certain representations and warranties exposures in 
Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which 
the original mortgage loan balances are no longer 
outstanding; and
VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection 
with the Company’s funding activities. The Company 
does not have a variable interest in these trusts.

The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the 
carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. 
The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the 
current fair value of the assets depending on the classification 
of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated 
accounting model ascribed to that classification.

The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the 

Company has significant involvement represent the most 
current information available to the Company. In most cases, 
the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without 
regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily 
available to the Company.

The maximum funded exposure represents the balance 
sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the 
VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, 
adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments 
received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for 
increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value 
recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded 
positions represents the remaining undrawn committed 
amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by 
the Company or the notional amount of a derivative 
instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain 
transactions, the Company has entered into derivative 
instruments or other arrangements that are not considered 
variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of 
credit protection under a credit default swap or total return 
swap where the Company pays the total return on certain 
assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are 
not included in the maximum exposure amounts.

The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are included on Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs, presented 
on the following page, and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include third-party assets of consolidated VIEs 
only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated 
VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or 
beneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit of Citigroup.

Consolidated VIEs
The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, 
which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales 
treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are recognized as 
secured liabilities. In general, the third-party investors in the 
obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to 
the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such 
recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a 
guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain 
derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s 

maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs 
is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated 
VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing. 
Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from 
being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these 
assets are the only source used to pay down the associated 
liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets. See 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about 
these Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

established to purchase the receivables. Citigroup transfers 
receivables into the trusts on a non-recourse basis. Credit card 
securitizations are revolving securitizations: as customers pay 
their credit card balances, the cash proceeds are used to 
purchase new receivables and replenish the receivables in the 
trust.

The Company’s primary credit card securitization activity 

is through two trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master Trust 
(Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with 
the substantial majority through the Master Trust. These trusts 
are consolidated entities because, as servicer, Citigroup has the 

power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the 
economic performance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller’s 
interest and certain securities issued by the trusts, which could 
result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits 
from the trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card 
receivables remain on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with 
no gain or loss recognized. The debt issued by the trusts to 
third parties is included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Citi utilizes securitizations as one of the sources of 

funding for its business in North America. The following table 
reflects amounts related to the Company’s securitized credit

Managed Loans
After securitization of credit card receivables, the Company 
continues to maintain credit card customer account 
relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred 
to the trusts. As a result, the Company considers the 
securitized credit card receivables to be part of the business it 
manages. As Citigroup consolidates the credit card trusts, all 
managed securitized card receivables are on-balance sheet.

Funding, Liquidity Facilities and Subordinated Interests
As noted above, Citigroup securitizes credit card receivables 
through two securitization trusts—Master Trust and Omni 
Trust. The liabilities of the trusts are included on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, excluding those retained by 
Citigroup.

Master Trust Liabilities (at Par Value)
The Master Trust issues fixed- and floating-rate term notes. 
Some of the term notes may be issued to multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits. The weighted-average maturity of 
the third-party term notes issued by the Master Trust was 3.8 
years as of December 31, 2023 and 3.5 years as of 
December 31, 2022.

Mortgage Securitizations
Citigroup provides a wide range of mortgage loan products to 
a diverse customer base. Once originated, the Company often 
securitizes these loans through the use of VIEs. These VIEs 
are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed 
solely by the transferred assets. These certificates have the 
same life as the transferred assets. In addition to providing a 
source of liquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing 
these assets also reduces Citi’s credit exposure to the 
borrowers. These mortgage loan securitizations are primarily 
non-recourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future 
credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the 
trust.

Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains 
the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment 
securities, interest-only strips and residual interests in future 
cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing for a 
limited number of Services, Markets and Banking 
securitizations. Citi’s Services, Markets and Banking 
businesses may hold investment securities pursuant to credit 
risk retention rules or in connection with secondary market-
making activities. 

The Company securitizes mortgage loans generally 
through either a U.S. government-sponsored agency, such as 
Ginnie Mae, a U.S. agency-sponsored entity, such as Fannie 
Mae or Freddie Mac, or a private label (non-agency-sponsored 

mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary beneficiary 
of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities 
because Citigroup does not have the power to direct the 
activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the 
entities’ economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not 
consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization entities. Substantially all of the consumer loans 
sold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by 
Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained 
interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization trusts are classified as Trading account assets, 
except for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on 
Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-agency-
sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citi is 
either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant 
activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer, but the servicing 
relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship; therefore, 
Citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.
In certain instances, the Company has (i) the power to 
direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ 
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to either absorb 
losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially 
significant to its non-agency-sponsored mortgage 
securitization entities and, therefore, is the primary beneficiary 
and, thus, consolidates the VIE.

For non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities 
where the transfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for 
sale accounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the 
difference between the carrying value of the transferred assets 
and the proceeds received (generally cash but may be 
beneficial interests or servicing rights).

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 

ended December 31, 2023 were $0.4 million and $88.7 
million, respectively. 

Agency and non-agency securitization gains for the year 

ended December 31, 2022 were $1.3 million and $154.8

Consumer Loan Securitizations
Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Citi relaunched a 
program securitizing other consumer loans into asset-backed 
securities. The principal securitized and the proceeds from 
new securitizations for the year ended December 31, 2023 
were $1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. The gain 
recognized on the securitization of consumer loans was 
$7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s 
U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the 
servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream 
of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of 
the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service 
the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may 
lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of 
future servicing fees.

These transactions create intangible assets referred to as 

MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. The fair value of Citi’s capitalized MSRs was 
$691 million and $665 million at December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. The MSRs correspond to principal loan 
balances of $52 billion and $51 billion as of December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively. 

The following table summarizes the changes in 

capitalized MSRs:

The fair value of the MSRs is primarily affected by 
changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in 
mortgage interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates tend 
to lead to declining prepayments, which causes the fair value 
of the MSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup 
economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its 
MSRs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts, 
forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-backed 
securities and purchased securities, all classified as Trading 
account assets. 

The Company receives fees during the course of servicing 

previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees

Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for 
new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency 
(private label) securities to re-securitization entities during the 
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. These securities are 
backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are 
often structured on behalf of clients. 

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, Citi held no retained 

interests in private label re-securitization transactions 
structured by Citi. 

The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-

agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. 
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Citi 
transferred agency securities with a fair value of 
approximately $17.1 billion and $24.1 billion, respectively, to 
re-securitization entities. 

As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of Citi-retained 
interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by 
Citi totaled approximately $1.7 billion (including $930 million 
related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2023), 
compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 (including 
$801 million related to re-securitization transactions executed 
in 2022), which is recorded in Trading account assets. The 
original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in 
which Citi holds a retained interest as of December 31, 2023 
and 2022 were approximately $84.1 billion and $79.4 billion, 
respectively.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not 

consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization 
entities.

Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper 
Conduits
The Company is active in the asset-backed commercial paper 
conduit business as administrator of several multi-seller 
commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to 
single-seller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored 
by third parties.

Citi’s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are 

designed to provide the Company’s clients access to low-cost 
funding in the commercial paper markets. The conduits 
purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients 
and are funded by issuing commercial paper to third-party 
investors. The conduits generally do not purchase assets 
originated by Citi. The funding of the conduits is facilitated by 
the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the 
Company.

As administrator to Citi’s conduits, the Company is 
generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets 
purchased or financed by the conduits, making decisions 
regarding the funding of the conduits, including determining 
the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued, 
monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits’ assets 
and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits. 
In return, the Company earns structuring fees from customers 
for individual transactions and earns an administration fee 
from the conduit, which is equal to the income from the client 
program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of 
conduit expenses. This administration fee is fairly stable, since 
most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed 
back to the clients. Once the asset pricing is negotiated, most 
ongoing income, costs and fees are relatively stable as a 
percentage of the conduit’s size.

The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest 
in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties. The 
assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that 
are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than 
actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on 
each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper 
issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the 
client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with 
transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by 
the third-party client seller, including over-collateralization, 
cash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or 
third-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized 
with the objective of approximating a credit rating of A or 
above, based on Citi’s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 
2023 and 2022, the commercial paper conduits administered 
by Citi had approximately $21.1 billion and $19.6 billion of 
purchased assets outstanding, respectively, and had unfunded 
commitments with clients of approximately $16.7 billion and 
$13.9 billion, respectively.

Substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the 

form of short-term commercial paper. At December 31, 2023 
and 2022, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 
68 and 64 days, respectively. 

The primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit 

investors is in the form of transaction-specific credit 
enhancements described above. Each asset purchased by the 
conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit 

254

enhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess 
spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party 
guarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of 
approximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on 
Citi’s internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-
specific credit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters 
of credit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of 
the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $200 million to $350 
million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the 
conduits total approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 
2023 and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The net result 
across multi-seller conduits administered by the Company is 
that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-
specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in 
each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the 
commercial paper investors.

Citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of 
liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the 
conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other 
events. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a 
transaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset 
purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has 
generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible 
receivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed 
to provide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does 
not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any 
funding under the APA will likely subject the underlying 
conduit clients to increased interest costs. In addition, the 
Company provides the conduits with program-wide liquidity 
in the form of short-term lending commitments. Under these 
commitments, the Company has agreed to lend to the conduits 
in the event of a short-term disruption in the commercial paper 
market, subject to specified conditions. The Company receives 
fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and 
considers these fees to be on fair market terms.

Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in the 
commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-
based fee for providing such services. Along with third-party 
dealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper 
and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending 
sale to a third party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the 
market, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper 
issued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as 
conduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the 
normal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper, 
including commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company owned $10.1 
billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of the commercial paper 
issued by its administered conduits. The Company’s 
investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the 
Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase 
the commercial paper issued by the conduits.

The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are 
consolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, 
through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has 
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the entities’ economic performance. These powers include its 
ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the 
conduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation 
activities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the 

conduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result 
of all the Company’s involvement described above, it was 
concluded that Citi has an economic interest that could 
potentially be significant. No assets of any conduit are 
available to satisfy the creditors of Citigroup or any of its 
other subsidiaries.

Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs)
A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that purchases 
a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-investment 
grade corporate loans. CLOs issue multiple tranches of debt 
and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay 
upfront expenses associated with forming the CLO. A third-
party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the 
underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit 
risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the 
asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a 
manner consistent with the CLO’s asset management 
agreement and indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager 
will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that 
most significantly impact the economic performance of the 
CLO. Investors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt 
and/or equity in it, can also direct certain activities of the 
CLO, including removing its asset manager under limited 
circumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on 
amendments to the CLO’s operating documents and other 
activities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12 years.

Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with 
respect to the CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the 
CLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain 
Citi entities may purchase some portion of a CLO’s liabilities 
for investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, 
typically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by 
the CLOs to support its market-making activities.

The Company generally does not have the power to direct 

the activities that most significantly impact the economic 
performance of the CLOs, as this power is generally held by a 
third-party asset manager of the CLO. As such, those CLOs 
are not consolidated.

Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
Municipal TOB trusts may hold fixed- or floating-rate, taxable 
or tax-exempt securities issued by state and local governments 
and municipalities. TOB trusts are typically structured as 
single-issuer entities whose assets are purchased from either 
the Company or from other investors in the municipal 
securities market. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their 
municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates: long-
dated, floating rate certificates (“Floaters”) that are putable 
pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates 
(“Residuals”). The Floaters are purchased by third-party 
investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The 
Residuals are purchased by the original owner of the 
municipal securities that are being financed.

From Citigroup’s perspective, there are two types of TOB 

trusts: customer and non-customer. Customer TOB trusts are 
those trusts utilized by customers of the Company to finance 
their securities, generally municipal securities. The Residuals 
issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being 
financed. Non-customer TOB trusts are generally used by the 
Company to finance its own municipal securities investments; 
the Residuals issued by non-customer TOB trusts are 
purchased by the Company.

With respect to both customer and non-customer TOB 
trusts, Citi may provide remarketing agent services. If Floaters 
are optionally tendered and the Company, in its role as 
remarketing agent, is unable to find a new investor to purchase 
the optionally tendered Floaters within a specified period of 
time, Citigroup may, but is not obligated to, purchase the 
tendered Floaters into its own inventory. The level of the 
Company’s inventory of such Floaters fluctuates. 

For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve as a 

voluntary advance provider. In this capacity, the Company 
may, but is not obligated to, make loan advances to customer 
TOB trusts to purchase optionally tendered Floaters that have 
not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors. 
Such loans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of 
December 31, 2023, Citi had no outstanding voluntary 
advances to customer TOB trusts.

For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also 

provides credit enhancement. At December 31, 2023 and 
2022, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer 
TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the 
Company.

Citigroup also provides liquidity services to many 
customer and non-customer trusts. If a trust is unwound early 
due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying 
municipal bonds, the underlying municipal bonds are sold out 
of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the 
outstanding trust certificates. If this results in a shortfall 
between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of 
the tendered Floaters, the Company, pursuant to the liquidity 
agreement, would be obligated to make a payment to the trust 
to satisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts, 
Citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with 
the holder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual 
holder is obligated to reimburse the Company for any payment 
the Company makes under the liquidity arrangement. These 
reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining 
based on changes in the market value of the underlying 

255

 
municipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides 
liquidity to a non-customer TOB trust, a similar 
reimbursement arrangement may be executed, whereby the 
Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), as 
Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred by the 
liquidity provider.

For certain other non-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as 

tender option provider. The tender option provider 
arrangement allows Floater holders to put their interests 
directly to the Company at any time, subject to the requisite 
notice period requirements, at a price of par.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, liquidity agreements 
provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $0.4 
billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of which $0.3 billion and 
$0.7 billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement 
agreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB 
transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at 
least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction, 
no reimbursement agreement was executed. 

Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB 
trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated 
by the Company, as the power to direct the activities that most 
significantly impact the trust’s economic performance rests 
with the customer Residual holder, which may unilaterally 
cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

Non-customer TOB trusts generally are consolidated 
because the Company holds the Residual interest and thus has 
the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust’s bonds.

The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or 

letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment 
funds, which are not variable interest entities, and 
municipality-related issuers that totaled $1.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by 
reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

Municipal Investments
Municipal investment transactions include debt and equity 
interests in partnerships that finance the construction and 
rehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new 
or underserved markets or finance the construction or 
operation of renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi 
generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and 
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and 
grants earned from the investments made by the partnership. 
The Company may also provide construction loans or 
permanent loans for the development or operation of real 
estate properties held by partnerships. These entities are 
generally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities 
of these entities is typically held by the general partner. 
Accordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup.

Client Intermediation
Client intermediation transactions represent a range of 
transactions designed to provide investors with specified 
returns based on the returns of an underlying security, 
referenced asset or index. These transactions include credit-
linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these transactions, the 
VIE typically obtains exposure to the underlying security, 
referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument, such 
as a total-return swap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE 
issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the 
specified underlying security, referenced asset or index. The 
VIE invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed 
insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative 
contract over the term of the transaction. The Company’s 
involvement in these transactions includes being the 
counterparty to the VIE’s derivative instruments and investing 
in a portion of the notes issued by the VIE. In certain 
transactions, the investor’s maximum risk of loss is limited 
and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level. 
Citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEs 
that most significantly impact their economic performance and 
thus it does not consolidate them.

Citi’s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is 
defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and 
the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi 
through a separate instrument issued by the VIE. The 
derivative instrument held by the Company may generate a 
receivable from the VIE (e.g., where the Company purchases 
credit protection from the VIE in connection with the VIE’s 
issuance of a credit-linked note), which is collateralized by the 
assets owned by the VIE. These derivative instruments are not 
considered variable interests and any associated receivables 
are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to 
the VIE.

Investment Funds
The Company is the investment manager for certain 
investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various 
asset classes including private equity, hedge funds, real estate, 
fixed income and infrastructure. Citigroup earns a 
management fee, which is a percentage of capital under 
management, and may earn performance fees. In addition, for 
some of these funds the Company has an ownership interest in 
the investment funds. Citi has also established a number of 
investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to 
invest in private equity investments. The Company acts as 
investment manager for these funds and may provide 
employees with financing on both recourse and non-recourse 
bases for a portion of the employees’ investment 
commitments.

256

Asset-Based Financing
The Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs that hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit 
approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the Company. Financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are, in 
most circumstances, reported in Trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings. The Company generally does 
not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs’ economic performance; thus, it does not 
consolidate them.

The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi’s 
maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with 
no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

24.  DERIVATIVES 

In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into 
various types of derivative transactions, which include: 

•

•

•

Futures and forward contracts, which are commitments 
to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, 
commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be 
settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily 
convertible to cash.
Swap contracts, which are commitments to settle in cash 
at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to 
a number of years, based on differentials between 
specified indices or financial instruments, as applied to a 
notional principal amount.
Option contracts, which give the purchaser, for a 
premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell 
within a specified time a financial instrument, commodity 
or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled 
in cash, based on differentials between specified indices 
or prices.

Swaps, forwards and some option contracts are over-the-
counter (OTC) derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with 
counterparties and settled with those counterparties, except for 
swap contracts that are novated and “cleared” through central 
counterparties (CCPs). Futures contracts and other option 
contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an 
exchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of 
the transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts 
relating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other 
market/credit risks for the following reasons:

•

•

Trading Purposes: Citigroup trades derivatives as an 
active market maker. Citigroup offers its customers 
derivatives in connection with their risk management 
actions to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, 
foreign exchange and other market/credit risks or for their 
own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages its 
derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities.
Hedging: Citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its 
own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or 
reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging may 
be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in 
accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For 
example, Citigroup issues fixed-rate long-term debt and 
then enters into a receive-fixed, pay-variable-rate interest 
rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to 
synthetically convert the interest payments to a net 
variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common 
form of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes net interest 
cost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are 
also used to manage market risks inherent in specific 
groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including 
AFS securities, commodities and borrowings, as well as 
other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. In addition, 
foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S.-
dollar-denominated debt, foreign currency-denominated 
AFS securities and net investment exposures. 

Derivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or 

liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative 
product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in 
interest rates, market prices, foreign exchange rates and other 
factors and is a function of the type of product, the volume of 
transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement and the 
underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the 
event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a 
derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by 
Citi is not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in 
earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is 
subject to management’s assessment of the probability of 
counterparty default. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure 
that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the 
ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time 
and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and 
financial stress. 

Derivative transactions are customarily documented under 

industry standard master netting agreements, which provide 
that following an event of default, the non-defaulting party 
may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties 
and determine the net amount due to be paid to, or by, the 
defaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make a 
payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of 
agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and 
grace periods, (iii) breach of a representation, (iv) cross 
default, either to third-party debt or to other derivative 
transactions entered into between the parties, or, in some 
cases, their affiliates, (v) the occurrence of a merger or 
consolidation that results in the creditworthiness of a party 
becoming materially weaker, and (vi) the cessation or 
repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support 
document. Obligations under master netting agreements are 
often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard 
credit support annex to the master netting agreement. An event 
of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a 
party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured 
following applicable notice and grace periods. 

The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the 

master netting agreements are considered to be legally 
enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained 
from counsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the 
requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and (ii) 
that the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to 
terminate and close-out transactions on a net basis under these 
agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law 
upon an event of default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or 
similar proceeding. 

A legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions 

where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of 
such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation 
may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some 
jurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency 
law may not provide the requisite level of certainty. For 
example, this may be the case for certain sovereigns, 
municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. 

258

Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by 

Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivatives 

market volatility, which may impair the ability of 
counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company. 
Credit limits are established and closely monitored for 
customers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers 
the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its 
offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit 
support annexes to be an important factor in its risk 
management process. Specifically, Citi generally transacts 
much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting 
agreements where Citi does not have the requisite level of 
legal certainty regarding enforceability, because such 
derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty 
credit limits than those executed under enforceable master 
netting agreements. 

Cash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10 

government debt securities are often posted by a party to a 
master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of 
the other party; the receiving party is free to commingle/
rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its 
business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds, 
municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also 
be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security 
collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting 
agreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or 
securities, may from time to time be segregated in an account 
at a third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account 
control agreement.

activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table 
below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts 
from which contractual payments are derived and do not 
represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative 
transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from 
market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure 
(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial 
stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation 
adjustments that may be required on the transactions. 
Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the netting of 
offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-
fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets 
this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with 
a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is 
reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de 
minimis overall market risk. 

In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can 

fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of 
business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity 
and other factors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading 
account assets/Trading account liabilities on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

(1) Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection 
seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The 
Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of 
overall risk.

The following tables present the gross and net fair values 

of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related 
offsetting amounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Gross 
positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values 
by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting 
agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables 
in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given 
counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in 
the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the 
enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been 
obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security 
collateral. 

In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes 
adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities 
to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related 
variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair 
values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to 
presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are 
subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also 
record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables 
also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such 
as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party 
custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the 
extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion 
supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights 
has been obtained.

Accounting for Derivative Hedging
Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance 
with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. As a general rule, 
hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed 
to a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange 
risk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or 
liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an 
existing asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may 
affect earnings.

Derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with 
changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges, while 
contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows 
are cash flow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt 
instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated 
with equity investments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-
currency foreign subsidiaries (i.e., net investment in a foreign 
operation) are net investment hedges.

To qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge 
accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge 
accounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be 
highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being 
hedged. The hedging relationship must be formally 
documented at inception, detailing the particular risk 
management objective and strategy for the hedge. This 
includes the item and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging 
instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed. 

The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at 
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a 
retrospective and prospective basis, typically using 
quantitative measures of correlation. Hedge effectiveness 
assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner 
for similar hedges, and are used consistently throughout the 
hedging relationships. The assessment of effectiveness may 
exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are 
unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair 
value of the derivative associated with time value.

Discontinued Hedge Accounting
A hedging instrument must be highly effective in 
accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes 
in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk 
being hedged. Management may voluntarily de-designate an 
accounting hedge at any time, but if a hedging relationship is 
not highly effective, it no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting and must be de-designated. Subsequent changes in 
the fair value of the derivative are recognized in Other revenue 
or Principal transactions, similar to trading derivatives, with 
no offset recorded related to the hedged item.

For fair value hedges, any changes in the carrying value 
of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or 
liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield 
on the item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the 
end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the 
earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash 
flows impact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that 
some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not 
occur, any amounts that remain in AOCI related to these 
transactions must be immediately reflected in Other revenue.
The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized 

basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is 
managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The 
underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction may be an 
individual item or a portfolio of similar items.

Fair Value Hedges

Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk
Citigroup’s fair value hedges, which include hedges of closed 
pools of assets, are primarily hedges of fixed-rate long-term 
debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt securities or 
loans.

For qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the 
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in 
the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk 
are presented within Interest income or Interest expense based 
on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability. 

263

 
 
Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to 
foreign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt 
securities and long-term debt that are denominated in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the entity 
holding the securities or issuing the debt. The hedging 
instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or 
a cross-currency swap contract. Changes in the fair value of 
the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) of 
forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings 
over the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in the 
fair value of cross-currency basis associated with cross-
currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
and records them in Other comprehensive income.

Hedging of Commodity Price Risk 
Citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot 
price movements in physical commodities inventories. The 
hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying 
commodity. In this hedge, the change in the carrying value of 
the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the 
change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also 
reflected in earnings. Although the entire change in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings, under 
certain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes changes in the fair 
value of the forward points (i.e., spot-forward difference) of 
the futures contract from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness, and they are generally reflected directly in 
earnings over the life of the hedge. Under other hedge 
programs, Citi excludes changes in the fair value of forward 
points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records 
them in Other comprehensive income. 

The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Company’s fair value hedges:

(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are included in Interest income/Interest expense. The accrued interest income on fair value hedges is recorded in 

Net interest income and is excluded from this table. Amounts included both hedges of AFS securities and long-term debt on a net basis, which largely offset in the 
current period.

(2) The gain (loss) amounts for commodity hedges are included in Principal transactions for periods beginning 2023.
(3) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected 
directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in AOCI, are not reflected in the table 
above. The amount of cross-currency basis included in AOCI was $(70) million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(4) Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness reflected directly in earnings 

under the mark-to-market approach or recorded in AOCI under the amortization approach. The year ended December 31, 2023 includes gain (loss) of 
approximately $284 million and $28 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 
includes gain (loss) of approximately $86 million and $8 million under the mark-to-market approach and amortization approach, respectively.

Cumulative Basis Adjustment
Upon electing to apply ASC 815 fair value hedge accounting, 
the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect the 
cumulative changes in the hedged risk. This cumulative basis 
adjustment becomes part of the carrying amount of the hedged 
item until the hedged item is derecognized from the balance 
sheet. The table below presents the carrying amount of Citi’s 
hedged assets and liabilities under qualifying fair value hedges 
at December 31, 2023 and 2022, along with the cumulative 
basis adjustments included in the carrying value of those 
hedged assets and liabilities that would reverse through 
earnings in future periods.

(2)  These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $248 million for active hedges and $(51) million for de-designated hedges as of December 31, 2023, 
related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer approach. The Company 
designated approximately $14 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of financial assets with a carrying value of $28 billion as of December 31, 
2023) in a portfolio layer-hedging relationship.

(3)  All hedged corporate loans are designated in a fair value hedge using the portfolio layer approach. The Company designated approximately $3.6 billion as the 

hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of financial assets with a carrying value of $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2023).

(4)  These amounts include a cumulative basis adjustment of $(91) million for active hedges and $(309) million for de-designated hedges as of December 31, 2022, 
related to certain prepayable financial assets previously designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge using the last-of-layer approach. The Company 
designated approximately $3 billion as the hedged amount (from a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets with a carrying value of $11 billion as of 
December 31, 2022) in a last-of-layer hedging relationship.

(5)  Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.

265

 
 
 
Cash Flow Hedges
Citigroup hedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due 
to changes in contractually specified interest rates associated 
with floating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted 
transactions. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and 
receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate 
swaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are 
synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering 
into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash 
flow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or 
dollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging 
relationships are highly effective at inception and on an 
ongoing basis. 

For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value 

of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then 
reclassified to earnings in the same period that the forecasted 
hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change in 
AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:

The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges 
expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of 
December 31, 2023 is approximately $(0.8) billion. The 
maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are 
hedged is 15 years.

The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is 

presented in Note 21.

Net Investment Hedges
Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign Currency Matters—
Foreign Currency Transactions, ASC 815 allows the hedging 
of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign 
operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards, cross-
currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated 
debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk 
associated with Citigroup’s equity investments in several non-
U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi 
records the change in the fair value of these hedging 
instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments 
in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency translation 
adjustment (CTA) within AOCI.

For derivatives designated as net investment hedges, 
Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 
815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value, 
including changes related to the forward-rate component of the 
foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of 
foreign currency options, are recorded in CTA within AOCI.
For foreign currency-denominated debt instruments that 

are designated as hedges of net investments, the translation 
gain or loss that is recorded in CTA is based on the spot 
exchange rate between the functional currency of the 
respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the 
functional currency of Citigroup. 

The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI, 

related to net investment hedges, was $(1.4) billion, 
$370 million and $855 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year 
ended December 31, 2022 includes a $36 million pretax loss 
related to net investment hedges, respectively, which were 
reclassified from AOCI into earnings (recorded in Other 
revenue). 

Economic Hedges
Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting 
would be too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user 
derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value, 
with changes in value included in either Principal transactions 
or Other revenue. 

For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-

term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP.

For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 
hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply 
ASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair 
value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair 
value recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be 
carried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are 
affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a 
change in the swap’s value, but for which no offsetting change 
in value is recorded on the debt.

Citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at 

fair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable 
election is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in 
fair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in 
fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in 
earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt’s fair 
value change. To the extent that the two amounts differ 
because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes 

267

risks not offset by the interest rate swap, the difference is 
automatically captured in current earnings.

Additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit 
risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments. 
Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other 
areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an 
economic hedge after considering the relative costs and 
benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the 
hedged item itself is marked-to-market through current 
earnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to 
four-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs.

Credit Derivatives
Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. 
Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes 
protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference 
credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit 
risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other 
cash positions and to facilitate client transactions. 

Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit 
derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
approximately 98% and 98%, respectively, of the gross 
receivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains 
master netting agreements, collateral agreements or settles 
daily. A majority of Citi’s top 15 counterparties (by receivable 
balance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, 
financial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these 
counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events. 
However, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an 
incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may 
call for additional collateral. 

The range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit 

default swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-
linked notes. 

A credit default swap is a contract in which, for a fee, a 
protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any 
losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a 
reference entity. These credit events are defined by the terms 
of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are 
generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on 
indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and, in a 
more limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit 
derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities 
also typically include additional credit events to cover the 
acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a 
payment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may 
be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed 
securities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the specific 
derivative contract, then the protection seller makes no 
payments to the protection buyer and receives only the 
contractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs 
as defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the 
protection seller will be required to make a payment to the 
protection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of 
protection may not be required to make a payment until a 
specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the 
portfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a 
specified amount.

A total return swap typically transfers the total economic 

performance of a reference asset, which includes all associated 
cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The 
protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any 
depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller 
and, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows 
associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. 
Thus, according to the total return swap agreement, the 
protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time 
the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the 
reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the 
underlying asset. A total return swap may terminate upon a 
default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to 
the reference entity, subject to the provisions of the related 
total return swap agreement between the protection seller and 
the protection buyer.

A credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors 

to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference 
entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the option writer 
assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on 
the reference entity at a specified “strike” spread level. The 
option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection 
on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the option 
writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit spread 
options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price 
of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other reference 
entity. The options usually terminate if a credit event occurs 
with respect to the underlying reference entity. 

A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative 
structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default 
swap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit 
protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that 
could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying 
reference entity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may 
be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt 
security of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of 
the note purchaser’s exposure is the amount paid for the 
credit-linked note.

Fair values included in the above tables are prior to 
application of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For 
notional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the 
total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it 
may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into 
offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The 
open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are 
largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets 
are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either 
to a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of 
subordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit 
derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to 
evaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned 
internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity. 

Where external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are 
considered to be “Baa/BBB” and above, while anything below 
is considered non-investment grade. Citi’s internal ratings are 
in line with the related external rating system. 

Citigroup evaluates the payment/performance risk of the 

credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller 
based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference 
credit. Credit derivatives written on an underlying non-
investment-grade reference entity represent greater payment 
risk to the Company. The non-investment-grade category in 
the table above also includes credit derivatives where the 
underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent 
to the inception of the derivative. 

269

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The maximum potential amount of future payments under 

credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is 
based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company 
believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is 
not representative of the actual loss exposure based on 
historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the 
value of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In 
accordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a 
credit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the 
difference between the protection sold and the value of the 
reference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit 
protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral 
paid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be 
calculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any 
credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a 
related master netting agreement. Due to such netting 
processes, determining the amount of collateral that 
corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not 
possible. The Company actively monitors open credit-risk 
exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of 
strategies, including purchased credit derivatives, cash 
collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk 
mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require 
the Company to either post additional collateral or 
immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the 
occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the 
Company. These events, which are defined by the existing 
derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit 
ratings of the Company and its affiliates. 

The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative 
instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that 
were in a net liability position at December 31, 2023 and 2022 
was $15 billion and $18 billion, respectively. The Company 
posted $12 billion and $15 billion as collateral for this 
exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively.

A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash 

settlement requirements for the Company and certain 
affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were 
downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies 
as of December 31, 2023, the Company could be required to 
post an additional $0.5 billion as either collateral or settlement 
of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could 
be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral 
previously received from existing derivative counterparties in 
the amount of $33 million upon the single notch downgrade, 
resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral 
requirements of approximately $0.5 billion.

Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with 
synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return 
of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the 
contract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is 
accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced 
financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in 
response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in 
whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative 
contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In 
certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales, 
resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see 
Note 1 for further discussion of the related sale conditions for 
transfers of financial assets). For a significant portion of the 
transactions, the Company has also executed another total 
return swap where the Company passes on substantially all of 
the economic return of the referenced securities to a different 
third party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company 
is not exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic 
return of the referenced securities.

These transactions generally involve the transfer of the 
Company’s liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or 
publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading 
portfolio and are executed with third-party financial 
institutions. The accompanying derivatives are typically total 
return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled and subject to 
ongoing margin requirements.

When the conditions for sale accounting are met, the 
Company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset 
as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative 
transaction. These transactions generally do not result in a gain 
or loss on the sale of the security, because the transferred 
security was held at fair value in the Company’s trading 
portfolio. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a 
sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained 
substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred 
asset through a total return swap executed with the same 
counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still 
outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross 
cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were 
$4.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. 

At December 31, 2023, the fair value of these previously 

derecognized assets was $4.3 billion. The fair value of the 
total return swaps as of December 31, 2023 was $121 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $29 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the fair 
value of these previously derecognized assets was $1.4 billion, 
and the fair value of the total return swaps was $27 million 
recorded as gross derivative assets and $32 million recorded as 
gross derivative liabilities. 

The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross 

basis, before the application of counterparty and cash 
collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity 
derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

25.  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 

Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, 
industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of 
counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in 
relation to Citigroup’s total credit exposure. Although 
Citigroup’s portfolio of financial instruments is broadly 
diversified along industry, product and geographic lines, 
material transactions are completed with other financial 
institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivatives 
and foreign exchange businesses.

In connection with the Company’s efforts to maintain a 
diversified portfolio, the Company limits its exposure to any 
one geographic region, country or individual creditor and 
monitors this exposure on a continuous basis. At 
December 31, 2023, Citigroup’s most significant 
concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. government and 
its agencies. The Company’s exposure, which primarily results 
from trading assets and investments issued by the U.S. 
government and its agencies, amounted to $517.2 billion and 
$431.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
The German, Mexican, Japanese and United Kingdom 
governments and their agencies, which are rated investment 
grade by both Moody’s and S&P, were the next largest 
exposures. The Company’s exposure to Germany amounted to 
$39.8 billion and $48.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. The Company’s exposure to Mexico 
amounted to $32.8 billion and $31.1 billion at December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s exposure to 
Japan amounted to $29.6 billion and $40.0 billion at 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s 
exposure to the United Kingdom amounted to $23.8 billion 
and $31.7 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively. The foreign government exposures are composed 
of investment securities, loans and trading assets.

The Company’s exposure to states and municipalities 
amounted to $17.6 billion and $20.1 billion at December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively, and was composed of trading 
assets, investment securities, derivatives and lending activities.

271

26.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, 
establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value 
and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair 
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, and 
therefore represents an exit price. Among other things, the 
standard requires the Company to maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
when measuring fair value.

Under ASC 820-10, the probability of counterparty 
default is factored into the valuation of derivatives and other 
positions, and the impact of Citigroup’s own credit risk is 
factored into the valuation of derivatives and other liabilities 
that are measured at fair value.

Fair Value Hierarchy
ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether 
the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs 
are developed using market data and reflect market participant 
assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s 
market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created 
the following fair value hierarchy:

•

•

•

Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active 
markets.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active 
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments 
in markets that are not active and model-derived 
valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers 
are observable in the market.
Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in 
which one or more significant inputs or significant value 
drivers are unobservable.

As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company 

considers relevant and observable market inputs in its 
valuations where possible. 

The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically 

utilizes rules-based and data-driven criteria to determine 
whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or 
Level 3:

•

•

•

The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in 
an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 
instrument is based upon the frequency of observed 
transactions and the quality of independent market data 
available on the measurement date. 
A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is 
observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where 
any unobservable inputs are not significant to the 
valuation. The determination of whether an input is 
considered observable is based on the availability of 
independent market data and its corroboration, for 
example through observed transactions in the market.
Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.

Determination of Fair Value
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Company 
measures fair value using the procedures set out below, 
irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured 
at fair value as a result of an election, a non-recurring lower-
of-cost-or-market (LOCOM) adjustment, or because they are 
required to be measured at fair value.

When available, the Company uses quoted market prices 
from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such 
items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a market price 
is available, the Company will apply practical expedients 
(such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case 
the items may be classified as Level 2.

The Company may also apply a price-based methodology 

that utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market 
information obtained from recent trading activity in positions 
with the same or similar characteristics to the position being 
valued. If relevant and observable prices are available, those 
valuations may be classified as Level 2. However, when there 
are one or more significant unobservable “price” inputs, those 
valuations will be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when a 
quoted price is considered stale, a significant adjustment to the 
price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in 
the terms of the actual security being valued, or alternatively, 
when prices from independent sources are insufficient to 
corroborate a valuation, the “price” inputs are considered 
unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as 
Level 3.

If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is 
based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, 
where possible, current market-based parameters, such as 
interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Items 
valued using such internally generated valuation techniques 
are classified according to the lowest level input or value 
driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be 
classified as Level 3 even though there may be some 
significant inputs that are readily observable.

Fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques 

are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from 
independent vendors or brokers. Vendor and broker valuations 
may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed 
prices to proprietary valuation models, and the Company 
assesses the quality and relevance of this information in 
determining the estimate of fair value. The following section 
describes the valuation methodologies used by the Company 
to measure various financial instruments at fair value. Where 
appropriate, the description includes details of the valuation 
models, the key inputs to those models and any significant 
assumptions.

Market Valuation Adjustments
Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the 
individual financial instrument. The Company applies market 
valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of 
account, which do not include adjustments due to the size of 
the Company’s position, except as follows. ASC 820-10 
permits an exception, through an accounting policy election, to 
measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and 
financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position 
when certain criteria are met. Citi has elected to measure 

272

own credit CVA is determined using Citi-specific CDS 
spreads for the relevant tenor. Generally, counterparty 
CVA is determined using CDS spread indices for each 
credit rating and tenor. For certain identified netting sets 
where individual analysis is practicable (e.g., exposures to 
counterparties with liquid CDSs), counterparty-specific 
CDS spreads are used. For FVA, a term structure of 
spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures (e.g., 
the market liquidity spread used to represent the term 
funding premium associated with certain OTC 
derivatives).

The CVA and FVA are designed to incorporate a market 

view of the credit and funding risk, respectively, inherent in 
the derivative portfolio. However, most unsecured derivative 
instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not 
commonly transferred to third parties. Derivative instruments 
are normally settled contractually or, if terminated early, are 
terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the 
parties. Thus, the CVA and FVA may not be realized upon a 
settlement or termination in the normal course of business. In 
addition, all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed 
or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes 
in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative 
instruments.

The table below summarizes the CVA and FVA applied 

to the fair value of derivative instruments at December 31, 
2023 and 2022:

certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those 
criteria, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open risk 
position. The Company applies market valuation adjustments, 
including adjustments to account for the size of the net open 
risk position, consistent with market participant assumptions.
Valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as 
Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the 
fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position 
could be exited. These valuation adjustments are based on the 
bid/offer spread for an instrument in the market. When Citi 
has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial 
investments, such as derivatives, on the basis of the net open 
risk position, the valuation adjustment may take into account 
the size of the position.

Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding 
valuation adjustments (FVA) are applied to certain over-the-
counter (OTC) derivative instruments where adjustments to 
reflect counterparty credit risk, own credit risk and term 
funding risk are required to estimate fair value. This 
principally includes derivatives with a base valuation (e.g., 
discounted using overnight indexed swap (OIS)) requiring 
adjustment for these effects, such as uncollateralized interest 
rate swaps. The CVA represents a portfolio-level adjustment 
to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterparty’s 
(assets) or Citi’s (liabilities) non-performance risk. 

The FVA represents a market funding risk premium 

inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative 
portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that 
do not include standard credit support annexes (CSAs), such 
as where the CSA does not permit the reuse of collateral 
received. Citi’s FVA methodology leverages the existing CVA 
methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile. The 
calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral 
agreements in which the terms do not permit the Company to 
reuse the collateral received, including where counterparties 
post collateral to third-party custodians. Citi’s CVA and FVA 
methodologies consist of two steps: 

•

•

First, the exposure profile for each counterparty is 
determined using the terms of all individual derivative 
positions and a Monte Carlo simulation or other 
quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash 
flows at future points in time. The calculation of this 
exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk 
mitigants and sources of funding, including pledged cash 
or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists 
with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting 
agreements. Individual derivative contracts that are 
subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a 
counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this 
purpose, since it is those net cash flows that are subject to 
nonperformance risk. This process identifies specific, 
point-in-time future cash flows that are subject to 
nonperformance and term funding risk, rather than using 
the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to 
measure the CVA and FVA. 
Second, for CVA, market-based views of default 
probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the 
credit default swap (CDS) market are applied to the 
expected future cash flows determined in step one. Citi’s

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and 
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
No quoted prices exist for these instruments, since fair value is 
determined using a discounted cash flow technique. Cash 
flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract, taking 
into account any embedded derivatives or other features. 
These cash flows are discounted using interest rates 
appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the 
nature of the underlying collateral. Generally, when such 
instruments are recorded at fair value, they are classified 
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in 
the valuation are readily observable. However, certain long-
dated positions are classified within Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy.

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Trading Securities 
and Trading Loans
When available, the Company uses quoted market prices in 
active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities; 
such items are classified within Level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy. Examples include government securities and 
exchange-traded equity securities.

For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the 
counter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing 
various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, 
price-based and internal models. Fair value estimates from 
these internal valuation techniques are verified, where 
possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, 
including third-party vendors. A price-based methodology 
utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other market 
information obtained from recent trading activity of 
instruments with similar characteristics to the bond or loan 
being valued. The yields used in discounted cash flow models 
are derived from the same price information. Trading 
securities and loans priced using such methods are generally 
classified as Level 2. However, when the primary inputs to the 
valuation are unobservable, or prices from independent 
sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or 

security is generally classified as Level 3. Fair value estimates 
from these internal valuation techniques are verified, where 
possible, to prices obtained from independent sources, 
including third-party vendors. 

When the Company’s principal exit market for a portfolio 

of loans is through securitization, the Company uses the 
securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the 
loan portfolio. The securitization price is determined from the 
assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the 
current market environment. Where such a price verification is 
possible, loan portfolios are typically classified within Level 2 
of the fair value hierarchy.

For most of the subprime mortgage backed security 
(MBS) exposures, fair value is determined utilizing observable 
transactions where available, or other valuation techniques 
such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation 
assumptions derived from similar, more observable securities 
as market proxies. The valuation of certain asset-backed 
security (ABS) CDO positions is inferred through the net asset 
value of the underlying assets of the ABS CDO. 

Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—Derivatives
Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using 
quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where 
available, are classified as Level 1 within the fair value 
hierarchy.

Derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and 
derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal 
valuation techniques. These derivative instruments are 
classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the 
observability of the significant inputs to the valuation.

The valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative 

and the nature of the underlying instrument. The principal 
techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash 
flows and internal models, such as derivative pricing models 
(e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations). 

The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the 

nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate 
yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and 
correlation. 

Investments
The investments category includes available-for-sale debt and 
marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally 
determined by utilizing similar procedures described for 
trading securities above or, in some cases, using vendor 
pricing as the primary source.

Also included in investments are nonpublic investments in 

private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair 
value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of 
management judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such 
securities are not generally traded. In addition, there may be 
transfer restrictions on private equity securities. The 
Company’s process for determining the fair value of such 
securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques, 
including guideline public company analysis and comparable 
transactions. In determining the fair value of nonpublic 
securities, the Company also considers events such as a 
proposed sale of the investee company, initial public offerings, 
equity issuances or other observable transactions. Private 

274

 
 
 
 
equity securities are generally classified within Level 3 of the 
fair value hierarchy.

Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt
Where fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of 
non-structured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal 
models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable 
maturity. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the 
fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily 
observable.

The Company determines the fair value of hybrid 

financial instruments, including structured liabilities, using the 
appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described 
above in “Trading Account Assets and Liabilities—
Derivatives”) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. 
Such instruments are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 
depending on the observability of significant inputs to the 
valuation.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present for each of the fair value 
hierarchy levels the Company’s assets and liabilities that are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 
2023 and 2022. The Company may hedge positions that have 

been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial 
instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as 
Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as 
Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented 
gross in the following tables:

Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).

(3) Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total 

assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding the cash collateral paid/received on derivatives.

Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Category
The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair 
value category for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 
2022. The gains and losses presented below include changes in 
the fair value related to both observable and unobservable 
inputs.

The Company often hedges positions with offsetting 
positions that are classified in a different level. For example, 

the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 
category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect 
of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may 
be classified in the Level 1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, 
the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category 
with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges are presented 
gross in the following tables:

(1) Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) are presented as increase (decrease) to Level 3 assets, and as (increase) decrease to Level 3 liabilities. Changes in fair value 

of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in AOCI, unless related to credit impairment, while gains and losses from sales are recorded in Realized gains 
(losses) from sales of investments in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(2) Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in Other revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(3) Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and AOCI for changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and 

DVA on fair value option liabilities), attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 that are still held at December 31, 
2022.

(4) Total Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.

Level 3 Fair Value Transfers 
The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023:

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, transfers 
of Long-term debt were $4.9 billion from Level 2 to Level 
3. Of the $4.9 billion transfer, approximately $4.2 billion 
related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming 
unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall 
valuation, and $0.6 billion related to equity and credit 
derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., 
interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/
or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, 
market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming 
more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming 
less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments 
(e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the 
money). This has primarily resulted in $10.2 billion of 
certain structured long-term debt products being 
transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months 
ended December 31, 2023.

The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the 
period December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022:

• During the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, transfers 
of Long-term debt were $9.9 billion from Level 2 to Level 
3. Of the $9.9 billion transfer, approximately $7.0 billion 
related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming 
unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall 
valuation, and $2.9 billion related to equity and credit 
derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., 
interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/
or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, 
market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming 
more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming 
less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments

certain structured long-term debt products being 
transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months 
ended December 31, 2022.

Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair 
Value Measurements
The Company’s Level 3 inventory consists of both cash 
instruments and derivatives of varying complexity.

The following tables present the valuation techniques 

covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most 
significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value 
measurements. Methodologies are applied consistently. 

Changes in listed inputs period versus period represent 
variables that become more, or less, significant, hence their 
addition or removal from the table below. Differences between 
this table and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value 
Rollforward table represent individually immaterial items that 
have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques 
other than those listed.

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to 
Unobservable Inputs
Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or 
dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the 
exit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today’s 
market. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value 
instruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that 
may be both unobservable and significant to the instrument’s 
(or portfolio’s) overall fair value measurement. The 
uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the 
Level 3 fair value measurements may not be independent of 
one another. In addition, the amount and direction of the 
uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in 
an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument 
as well as whether the Company holds the instrument as an 
asset or a liability. For certain instruments, the pricing, 
hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation 
between various inputs rather than on the analysis and 
aggregation of the individual inputs.

The following section describes some of the most 
significant unobservable inputs used by the Company in 
Level 3 fair value measurements.

Correlation
Correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more 
variables change in relation to each other. A variety of 
correlation-related assumptions are required for a wide range 
of instruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign 
exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other 
instruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations 
are not directly observable in the market and must be 
calculated using alternative sources, including historical 
information. Estimating correlation can be especially difficult 
where it may vary over time, and calculating correlation 
information from market data requires significant assumptions 
regarding the informational efficiency of the market (e.g., 
swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore exists when an 
estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into 
some fair value measurements is required.

Changes in correlation levels can have a substantial 

impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of an 
instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default 
correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds 
comprising a CDO structure would affect the fair value of the 
senior tranche. For example, an increase in the default 
correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair 
value of the senior tranche, because highly correlated 
instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a 
portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior 
tranche. That same change in default correlation would have a 
different impact on junior tranches of the same structure.

Volatility
Volatility represents the speed and severity of market price 
changes and is a key factor in pricing options. Volatility 
generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument 
and the strike price or level defined in the contract. Volatilities 
for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable 
and need to be estimated using alternative methods, such as 
comparable instruments, historical analysis or other sources of 

287

market information. This leads to uncertainty around the final 
fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable 
volatilities. 

The general relationship between changes in the value of 

an instrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also 
depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the 
underlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets) 
benefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option 
positions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are 
more sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For 
example, an at-the-money option would experience a greater 
percentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money 
option. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than 
one underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of 
equities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying 
securities as well as their correlations.

Yield
In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not 
observable in the market and must be estimated from historical 
data or from yields of similar securities. This estimated yield 
may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the 
security being valued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment 
is significant to the value of the security, the fair value 
measurement is classified as Level 3.

Adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected 
future principal and interest cash flows on instruments, such as 
asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield is impacted by changes 
in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads. 

Prepayment
Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change the 
future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair 
value of the security. The effect of prepayments is more 
pronounced for residential mortgage-backed securities. 
Prepayment is generally negatively correlated with 
delinquency and interest rate. A combination of low 
prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input’s 
negative impact on a mortgage security’s valuation. As 
prepayment speeds change, the weighted-average life of the 
security changes, which impacts the valuation either positively 
or negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and 
the direction of the change in the weighted-average life.

Recovery
Recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of 
a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation 
scenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial 
mortgage-backed securities), the expected recovery amount of 
a defaulted property is typically unknown until a liquidation of 
the property is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security 
may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in 
the future. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate 
assumption increases the fair value of the security. An increase 
in loss severity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the 
amount of principal available for distribution and, as a result, 
decreases the fair value of the security.

The fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible 
using quoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price 
exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted 
prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific 
attributes of that loan. Fair value for the other real estate 
owned is based on appraisals. For loans whose carrying 
amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, 
the fair values depend on the type of collateral. Fair value of 
the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market 
prices if available, appraisals or other internal valuation 
techniques.

Where the fair value of the related collateral is based on 
an appraised value, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. 
In addition, for corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are 
often based on sales of similar assets; however, because the 
prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to 
reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral, these 
fair value measurements are generally classified as Level 3.

The fair value of non-marketable equity securities under 
the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction 
prices for the identical or similar investment of the same 
issuer, or an internal valuation technique in the case of an 
impairment. Where there are insufficient market observations 
to conclude the inputs are observable, where significant 
adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or 
when an internal valuation technique is used, the security is 
classified as Level 3. Fair value may differ from the observed 
transaction price due to a number of factors, including 
marketability adjustments and differences in rights and 
obligations when the observed transaction is not for the 
identical investment held by Citi.

Credit Spread
Credit spread is a component of the security representing its 
credit quality. Credit spread reflects the market perception of 
changes in prepayment, delinquency and recovery rates, 
therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair 
value. Changes in credit spread affect the fair value of 
securities differently depending on the characteristics and 
maturity profile of the security. For example, credit spread is a 
more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a 
high-yield bond as compared to an investment-grade bond. 
Generally, the credit spread for an investment-grade bond is 
also more observable and less volatile than its high-yield 
counterpart.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the 
tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have 
been written down to fair value during the periods as a result 
of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity 
securities that have been measured using the measurement 
alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during 
the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward 
or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed 
during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the 
same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-
sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower 
of cost or market value.

The following tables present the carrying amounts of all

measurement was recorded:

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not 
Carried at Fair Value
The following tables present the carrying value and fair value 
of Citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value. The tables below therefore exclude items measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above.

The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate investments, 

pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance contracts 
and tax-related items. Also, as required, the disclosure 
excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount that 
could result from offering for sale at one time the entire 
holdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value 

associated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other 
expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In 
addition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets 
and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, 
relationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full 
assessment of Citigroup’s financial position and the value of 
its net assets. 

Fair values vary from period to period based on changes 

in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit 
quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets 
and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered into.

$13.7 billion, respectively, substantially all of which are 
classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair 
values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are 
generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.

27.  FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS

The Company may elect to report most financial instruments 
and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-
instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in 
earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made 
upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, 
financial liability or firm commitment or when certain 
specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election 

may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The 
changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. 
Movements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI. 
The Company has elected fair value accounting for its 
mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 23 for additional 
details on Citi’s MSRs. 

Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in 
which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 26.

The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:

Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s 
liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected 
using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. 
Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to 
changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected 
as a component of AOCI. See Note 21 for additional 
information. 

Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for 
which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-
recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the 
narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads. 
The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-
derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s 
own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a 
loss of $2,078 million and gain of $2,685 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in 
fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit 
risk were estimated by incorporating the Company’s current 
credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant 
valuation technique used to value each liability as described 
above.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities

Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under 
Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold 
Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and 
Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain 
portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under 
agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under 

agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities 
loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held 
primarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the 
United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was 
made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a 
portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative 
instruments that are accounted for at fair value through 
earnings. 

Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios 

are recorded in Principal transactions. The related interest 
income and interest expense are measured based on the 
contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported 
as Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income.

Certain Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain 
other originated and purchased loans, including certain 
unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of 
credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. 
None of these credit products are highly leveraged financing 
commitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans 
and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold 
or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the 
economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such 
as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where 
the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a 
third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to 
mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge 
accounting is complex and to achieve operational 
simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending 
transactions across the Company.

In addition to the amounts reported above, $391 million 
and $729 million of unfunded commitments related to certain 
credit products selected for fair value accounting were 
outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

292

 
 
 
 
Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit 

products are classified in Principal transactions in Citi’s 
Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest income is 
measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported 
as Interest income on Trading account assets or loan interest 
depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit 
products. The changes in fair value for the years ended 
December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit 
risk totaled to a gain of $39 million and loss of $155 million, 
respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific 
credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific 
credit spreads and recovery assumptions.

Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts 
(e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its 
commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment 
is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity 
derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for 
the debt host contract, and reports the contract within Trading 
account assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across 
unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $0.6 
billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively.

As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades 
unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward 
purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading 
counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals 
investment, Citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid 
and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated 
precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the 
trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is 
accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. 

Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain 
purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming 
adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are 
intended for sale or securitization and are economically 
hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected 
the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in 
cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve 
operational simplifications.

The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are 

reported in Other revenue in the Company’s Consolidated 
Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value 
during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to 
instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes 
in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in 
addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest 
income continues to be measured based on the contractual 
interest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income.

293

 
 
 
Certain Debt Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt 
liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be 
trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair 
value basis. These positions are classified as Long-term debt 
or Short-term borrowings on the Company’s Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.

are reported in Principal transactions. Changes in the fair 
value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also 
included in the change in fair value reported in Principal 
transactions.

Certain Non-Structured Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain non-
structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates. The 
Company has elected the fair value option where the interest 
rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with 
derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase 

financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value 
through earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate 
accounting mismatches and to achieve operational 
simplifications. These positions are reported in Short-term 
borrowings and Long-term debt on the Company’s 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes in fair 
value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads 
(i.e., DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while all 
other changes in fair value are reported in Principal 
transactions.

Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is measured 
based on the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
